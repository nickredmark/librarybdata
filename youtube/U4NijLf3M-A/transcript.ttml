<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">and we&#39;ve had the opportunity to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:46.830" style="s2">personally and I can understand why I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:50.700" style="s2">want to begin with something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.830" end="00:00:53.700" style="s2">Churchill wrote in the 1930s and he said</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.700" end="00:00:59.660" style="s2">is the diligence with which it passes</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">lack of purpose and opens them to the</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:32.820" style="s2">derived of their history are easily</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">persuaded have we stripped our young</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">people of purpose and we knee and left</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">them open to being bullied around well</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">there&#39;s two things about that that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.580" style="s2">think are really worth worth laying out</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">the first is an analysis of the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.580" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">of memory now because people think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">the purpose of memory is to remember the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:53.400" style="s2">past and that&#39;s not the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">memory the purpose of memory is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.400" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">extract out from the past lessons to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">structure the future and now that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">purpose of personal memory and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">done with a memory when you&#39;ve extracted</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">out the information that you can use to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:07.260" style="s2">guide yourself properly in the future so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.239" style="s2">if you have a traumatic memory for</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.260" end="00:02:12.269" style="s2">example that&#39;s really obsessing you if</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.239" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">you analyze that memory to the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.269" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">where you figured out how you put</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">yourself at risk and you can determine</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:19.680" style="s2">how you might avoid that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">then the emotion associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">goes away so memory is a has a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">pragmatic function and cultural memory</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">is the same thing is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:31.290" style="s2">extract out stories from our past that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:34.349" style="s2">structure our future and we need that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.290" end="00:02:37.140" style="s2">because first of all if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.349" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">purpose let&#39;s say it isn&#39;t that your</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.140" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">life becomes neutral</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:43.380" style="s2">in a meaningless sense it&#39;s that your</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:45.720" style="s2">life becomes characterized by unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.380" end="00:02:47.640" style="s2">suffering because the baseline condition</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.720" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">of life is something like unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.640" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">suffering and what you have to set</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:55.650" style="s2">against that is a noble and worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:02:57.270" style="s2">purpose and hopefully hopefully your</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.650" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">determination of that purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.270" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">buttress to some degree by the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:02.370" style="s2">the past because you can&#39;t conjure</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.070" style="s2">something like that up on your own and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.370" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">if you provide people with nobility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.070" end="00:03:08.730" style="s2">purpose then they can tolerate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">suffering of existence without becoming</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.730" end="00:03:12.270" style="s2">entirely corrupted by it and cultures</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">that don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.270" end="00:03:16.140" style="s2">it isn&#39;t even so much that they die it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:19.110" style="s2">that cultures that don&#39;t do that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.140" end="00:03:20.970" style="s2">dead they&#39;re done they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.110" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">story anymore and they don&#39;t have a call</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.970" end="00:03:25.800" style="s2">to adventure and then well then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">suffers stupidly as a consequence it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.800" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">very bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">so Churchill made the same observation</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:32.670" style="s2">that many of the great psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.580" style="s2">philosophers made in the early part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.670" end="00:03:38.640" style="s2">the 20th century it&#39;s like bring the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.580" end="00:03:41.400" style="s2">story forward and and propagate it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.640" end="00:03:43.830" style="s2">make it the most noble possible story</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.400" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">and then you motivate people to do to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.830" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">transcend themselves which they need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">do so yes he&#39;s exactly right in his</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">diagnosis just to stay with him for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:55.710" style="s2">moment he&#39;s painted as the great</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:57.570" style="s2">defender of freedom it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.710" end="00:03:59.070" style="s2">your country Canada and certainly my</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.570" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">country Australia would have not</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.070" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">continued as free societies had it not</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">been for that man courageously standing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">at a time when so few did he wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:12.390" style="s2">inventor of freedom freedom as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:15.570" style="s2">understand it and I want to unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">a bit something very very few people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.570" end="00:04:19.140" style="s2">very few cultures down through the ages</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">and even today have ever really</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.140" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">experienced yes and partly because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.530" end="00:04:29.100" style="s2">afraid of it I would say I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">think of freedom as the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.100" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">implement your whim and freedom opens up</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">that as a possibility but sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:37.500" style="s2">freedom that isn&#39;t what it&#39;s about at</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:38.970" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.500" end="00:04:40.920" style="s2">it&#39;s about it&#39;s primarily about</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.970" end="00:04:42.300" style="s2">responsibility it&#39;s about determining</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.920" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">which load you&#39;re going to pick up and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">carry that&#39;s the proper definition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:49.980" style="s2">appropriate freedom it&#39;s not grout</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:52.040" style="s2">Dillman gratification of instantaneous</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.980" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">impulse it&#39;s self-evident that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.040" end="00:04:55.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work two-year-olds do that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:57.380" style="s2">that&#39;s why they can&#39;t live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.400" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">they can&#39;t organize themselves across</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.380" end="00:05:02.090" style="s2">time they can&#39;t sacrifice the moment for</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">the future and the more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.090" end="00:05:06.530" style="s2">you get I suppose in some sense the more</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.460" end="00:05:08.330" style="s2">you&#39;re able to do that and then your</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.530" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">freedom becomes the freedom to choose</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.330" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">the proper responsibilities and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:13.700" style="s2">not that&#39;s also not something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">been good at communicating to young</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.700" end="00:05:16.820" style="s2">people if we talk to them about</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.780" end="00:05:18.770" style="s2">responsibility we did generally do it in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.820" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">a finger-wagging sort of way it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.770" end="00:05:23.060" style="s2">well you&#39;re breaking the rules you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:24.710" style="s2">bad person and and and well that may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.060" end="00:05:26.780" style="s2">true because people break the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:29.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no shortage of badness in people</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">but the the proper message for young</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.450" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">people is to say well no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:35.090" style="s2">understand you you want to take on</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.380" end="00:05:36.890" style="s2">responsibility you want to take on the</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.890" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2">that you might be able to move because</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:44.360" style="s2">it gives your life nobility and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:45.920" style="s2">and that offsets the tragedy and and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.360" end="00:05:47.780" style="s2">only psychologically not only does it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.920" end="00:05:50.030" style="s2">all set it psychologically because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.780" end="00:05:51.920" style="s2">have a purpose and and and something to</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.090" end="00:05:59.870" style="s2">properly you actually ameliorate</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:10.040" style="s2">something right to move things away from</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.460" end="00:06:27.320" style="s2">very interesting to watch as I look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.190" end="00:06:30.170" style="s2">it it seems to me that that Acton had it</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.080" end="00:06:48.110" style="s2">in a personal sense and then freedom to</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.110" end="00:06:51.590" style="s2">seems to me that what&#39;s missing is an</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">could even go so far as to say that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.670" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">misunderstood freedom turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">its own worst enemy well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:19.110" style="s2">the that&#39;s the difficult distinction</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:22.110" style="s2">between freedom of the moment and</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">taken into account and I&#39;m a real</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.880" end="00:07:27.480" style="s2">admirer of the work of Jean Piaget and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.800" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">Piaget is a developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.480" end="00:07:32.730" style="s2">and few people know the world&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:34.980" style="s2">well known developmental psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.730" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">and few people know that he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.980" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">motivated in his intellectual pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.460" style="s2">by the desire to reconcile science with</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:43.320" style="s2">religion that was what his driving force</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.460" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">from the time that he was a young man he</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.320" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know that even necessarily by</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:47.760" style="s2">reading his writings because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:52.320" style="s2">implicit rather than explicit in them</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.760" end="00:07:54.780" style="s2">but he he he has a different model of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.320" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">what constitutes morality than than</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.780" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">Freud Freud&#39;s model is combative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.140" style="s2">sort of the super-ego as tyrant so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:04.890" style="s2">super-ego would be the strictures of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.140" end="00:08:06.420" style="s2">society the it&#39;d the biological impulses</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.890" end="00:08:07.890" style="s2">and the eagle crushed between those</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.420" end="00:08:09.630" style="s2">right so the ego is this thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.890" end="00:08:12.360" style="s2">crushed between nature and culture and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.630" end="00:08:14.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a tense and combat</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.360" end="00:08:16.230" style="s2">of model of the human psyche and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.520" end="00:08:18.060" style="s2">something about it that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.230" end="00:08:19.710" style="s2">accurate because some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.060" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">restrictions that are put on your</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.710" end="00:08:25.770" style="s2">impulse gratification are imposed on you</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:29.220" style="s2">in in a sense tyrannically but Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.770" end="00:08:31.290" style="s2">his perspective was much more optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.220" end="00:08:33.030" style="s2">and I think much more accurate he</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.290" end="00:08:35.010" style="s2">noticed that as children organized</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.030" end="00:08:36.780" style="s2">themselves spontaneously as they</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.010" end="00:08:39.450" style="s2">developed especially within the confines</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.780" end="00:08:43.320" style="s2">of their own spontaneous play they</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.450" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t so much subsume lurk or inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.320" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">their dark and aggressive impulses as</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:52.620" style="s2">make them sophisticated and transform</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">them into universally acceptable games</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.620" end="00:08:58.770" style="s2">so for Piaget a game that a group of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">children were playing that all of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.770" end="00:09:02.760" style="s2">were playing voluntarily and that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:04.589" style="s2">going well and that they all wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.760" end="00:09:07.020" style="s2">continue playing was a microcosm of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.589" end="00:09:07.530" style="s2">society and and literally a microcosm of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.020" end="00:09:08.940" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.530" end="00:09:11.010" style="s2">the reason the children were playing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.940" end="00:09:13.530" style="s2">those games was to practice being</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.010" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">productive members of society and he</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.530" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">felt that the appropriate game tended</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:18.250" style="s2">towards what he described as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">equilibrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.250" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">date so an equilibrate estate would be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">game that you&#39;ll play because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:25.780" style="s2">decided it&#39;s a good game but that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">can play with others because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.780" end="00:09:29.800" style="s2">also decided that it&#39;s a good game and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:31.960" style="s2">so that can work at the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.800" end="00:09:33.580" style="s2">and at the familial level and at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.960" end="00:09:35.350" style="s2">social level and if you get all those</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.580" end="00:09:38.020" style="s2">things working simultaneously then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.350" end="00:09:40.600" style="s2">have a sustainable enterprise and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.020" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">it&#39;s predicated not so much on the on</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.600" end="00:09:45.850" style="s2">the inhibition of impulse or on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:49.750" style="s2">regulation of it but of the integration</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.850" end="00:09:51.940" style="s2">of impulses into a into a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.750" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">being that gratifies them on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.940" end="00:09:55.780" style="s2">relatively permanent basis so you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:57.970" style="s2">if you want to go to university and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:10:00.940" style="s2">become a physician I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.970" end="00:10:02.650" style="s2">of sacrifice of impulsive gratification</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:04.960" style="s2">that goes along with that but if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.650" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">become a physician then it&#39;s a noble</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.960" end="00:10:09.400" style="s2">enterprise people support you socially</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:11.590" style="s2">and all the needs that you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.400" end="00:10:13.240" style="s2">fulfilled will also be fulfilled by that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.590" end="00:10:16.030" style="s2">enterprise well that&#39;s a way better</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.240" end="00:10:18.610" style="s2">model and so it&#39;s strange that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.030" end="00:10:20.200" style="s2">maximum freedom comes with the adoption</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.610" end="00:10:22.060" style="s2">of a discipline and then also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.200" end="00:10:23.800" style="s2">adoption of responsibility that frees</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.060" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">you up and everyone else around you in</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.800" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">the long run and if you explain that to</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">people especially in this day and age</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:31.870" style="s2">when they be fed a never-ending diet of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">idiot rights and freedoms they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.870" end="00:10:36.250" style="s2">immediately on board with it because</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:37.690" style="s2">they know I know that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.250" end="00:10:39.220" style="s2">meaning that people experience in their</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.690" end="00:10:41.650" style="s2">life is a consequence of adopting</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.220" end="00:10:44.950" style="s2">responsibility so they&#39;re starving for</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.650" end="00:10:46.870" style="s2">that idea to be articulated opens up a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.950" end="00:10:48.580" style="s2">whole can of very very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:51.610" style="s2">issues let&#39;s try and pick a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.580" end="00:10:53.860" style="s2">but the first but if I do it&#39;s evident</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:10:55.030" style="s2">to me and I&#39;m an enormous encouraged by</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.860" end="00:10:57.610" style="s2">this because you know I&#39;m a passionate</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.030" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">Australian I want this country to be the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.610" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">sort of place that offers opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">of the sort that I had when I was young</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:05.800" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve had my opportunities but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:07.660" style="s2">look at my kids generation what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">to be there for them if we keep feeding</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.660" end="00:11:15.280" style="s2">the sort of thin gruel in reality the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:17.110" style="s2">people turning out in vast numbers every</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.280" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">one of your talks in Australia&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.110" end="00:11:23.260" style="s2">over subscribed massively it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:25.000" style="s2">they kind of get those more to this I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.260" end="00:11:26.890" style="s2">think they&#39;re being told oh yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.000" end="00:11:28.089" style="s2">know well it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.890" end="00:11:30.520" style="s2">so interesting about dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.089" end="00:11:32.080" style="s2">archetypal themes you know archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.520" end="00:11:34.210" style="s2">themes are archetypal because</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.080" end="00:11:37.300" style="s2">actually speak of the structure of human</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.210" end="00:11:40.090" style="s2">experience that&#39;s why they last and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.300" end="00:11:42.760" style="s2">it&#39;s human nature and human experience</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.090" end="00:11:44.680" style="s2">has a pattern you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.760" end="00:11:46.330" style="s2">capacity to articulate that pattern as</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.680" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">an individual in part because your life</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.330" end="00:11:51.430" style="s2">is too short you just can&#39;t figure it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:52.900" style="s2">out but the the ancient representations</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.430" end="00:11:55.300" style="s2">of those patterns are everywhere around</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.900" end="00:11:56.980" style="s2">you and you you know some of them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.300" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">image you you caught on to them</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.980" end="00:12:01.000" style="s2">automatically you you you fall into them</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:02.820" style="s2">if you go to a movie for example because</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.000" end="00:12:05.980" style="s2">movies always express archetypal themes</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.820" end="00:12:08.290" style="s2">if you hear them articulated you think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.980" end="00:12:10.300" style="s2">knew that I knew that I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.290" end="00:12:14.620" style="s2">how to say it that&#39;s that&#39;s the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.300" end="00:12:17.050" style="s2">idea of of learning is remembering your</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.620" end="00:12:20.020" style="s2">soul already knows but it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.050" end="00:12:22.960" style="s2">the words yeah and so when people talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.020" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">to me about watching my lectures let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.960" end="00:12:27.670" style="s2">say they say they basically say one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">two things if it if it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.670" end="00:12:30.580" style="s2">simple thank you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.850" style="s2">they say one of two things a third of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.580" end="00:12:36.280" style="s2">them say quarter for them say when I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.850" end="00:12:37.480" style="s2">listen to you talk it&#39;s as if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.280" end="00:12:39.460" style="s2">telling me things that I already know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.480" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah well that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.460" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">because that&#39;s what archetypal stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:45.430" style="s2">are they&#39;re the description of what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:48.790" style="s2">already know but that can be articulated</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.430" end="00:12:50.260" style="s2">and then who you are and how you see</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.790" end="00:12:52.870" style="s2">yourself and the way you describe</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.260" end="00:12:54.400" style="s2">yourself or all become the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.870" end="00:12:56.080" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful then you&#39;re not at odds</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.400" end="00:12:57.880" style="s2">with yourself you know and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.080" end="00:12:59.140" style="s2">then you&#39;re a functioning unity and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.880" end="00:13:00.580" style="s2">makes you much stronger and more</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.140" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">indomitable than you would otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.580" end="00:13:04.360" style="s2">and then the other thing that people say</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:07.540" style="s2">and this is more like 3/4 of them is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.360" end="00:13:10.060" style="s2">that they say I was in a very dark place</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.540" end="00:13:12.100" style="s2">I was addicted I was I was drinking too</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.060" end="00:13:13.900" style="s2">much I had a fragmented relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.100" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">with my fiancee and I wasn&#39;t getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.900" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">married things weren&#39;t going where very</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:19.780" style="s2">well with my family my relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.510" style="s2">my father was damaged I didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.780" end="00:13:24.760" style="s2">aim I was wasting my time some variant</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.510" end="00:13:28.330" style="s2">of that some combination of those and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.760" end="00:13:30.280" style="s2">they said well hmm I&#39;ve been watching</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.330" end="00:13:32.350" style="s2">your lectures I&#39;ve decided to establish</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.280" end="00:13:35.860" style="s2">a purpose I&#39;m trying to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.350" end="00:13:38.410" style="s2">and things are way better and I&#39;ve and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.860" end="00:13:40.330" style="s2">so let&#39;s say I&#39;ve done maybe eight or</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.410" end="00:13:41.790" style="s2">nine large-scale public talks in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.330" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">last two months so that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.790" end="00:13:46.860" style="s2">20,000 people and about half of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:49.019" style="s2">half of them estate afterwards to talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.860" end="00:13:50.670" style="s2">to me so that&#39;s about 7,000 people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.019" end="00:13:52.050" style="s2">have said that to me and then people</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.670" end="00:13:54.059" style="s2">stopped me on the street all the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.050" end="00:13:56.309" style="s2">and tell me exactly that story which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.059" end="00:13:57.959" style="s2">just wonderful like you can&#39;t imagine</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.309" end="00:13:59.970" style="s2">how good it is to be able to go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.959" end="00:14:01.319" style="s2">places you&#39;ve never been and to have</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.970" end="00:14:03.959" style="s2">people stop you on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.319" end="00:14:06.839" style="s2">spontaneously and say look my life is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.959" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">way better than it was it&#39;s like it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.839" end="00:14:12.180" style="s2">good and so and I&#39;ve got like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">know 35,000 letters from people since</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.180" end="00:14:15.509" style="s2">last August it&#39;s more than that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.699" style="s2">keep track of them and it&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.509" end="00:14:19.559" style="s2">same thing like 3/4 the quarter of them</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.699" end="00:14:21.209" style="s2">say well you&#39;ve given me the words to</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.559" end="00:14:23.309" style="s2">say what I already knew was true and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.209" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">thank you for that I can see that in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.309" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">audience it&#39;s so interesting because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.529" style="s2">can lay out a story people go like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:30.329" style="s2">and say they&#39;re doing that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.529" end="00:14:32.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like the lights are going on and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.329" end="00:14:33.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a really while there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:35.550" style="s2">nothing better than that to watch lights</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.990" end="00:14:37.670" style="s2">go on when you&#39;re talking to people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.550" end="00:14:41.189" style="s2">like that&#39;s just absolutely fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.670" end="00:14:44.970" style="s2">but to get this response from people my</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.610" end="00:15:00.209" style="s2">we&#39;ve had discussions about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.809" end="00:15:01.679" style="s2">constantly he&#39;s overwhelmed by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.209" end="00:15:04.709" style="s2">that so many people are writing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.679" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">saying the same thing it&#39;s like I have a</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:10.589" style="s2">finally realized that and I&#39;m putting it</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:12.569" style="s2">into practice and I&#39;m bearing up under</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.589" end="00:15:15.179" style="s2">the heaviest load I can imagine and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.259" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">better than that there&#39;s zero harm in it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.410" end="00:15:28.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s just people putting their</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:30.509" style="s2">lives together they&#39;re not mucking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.559" end="00:15:32.879" style="s2">with other people and I&#39;m trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.509" end="00:15:34.620" style="s2">broad-scale social transformations about</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.879" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">which they have no idea they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.620" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">to make their immediate environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:42.449" style="s2">better and it&#39;s working it&#39;s like great</p>

<p begin="00:15:42.449" end="00:15:45.600" style="s2">minute I&#39;d say as a form of legislature</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:47.339" style="s2">that there&#39;s an enormous amount of good</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.600" end="00:15:48.839" style="s2">enough huh a country is only there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.339" end="00:15:50.579" style="s2">some type of the people that make it up</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.839" end="00:15:53.610" style="s2">to the extent that they&#39;re put together</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.579" end="00:15:56.590" style="s2">a resilient AV contribute don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.610" end="00:15:58.840" style="s2">ask others to help them</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.590" end="00:16:01.840" style="s2">the stronger the nation oh this is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.840" end="00:16:03.310" style="s2">yes and rapidly like I I mean I think I</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.840" end="00:16:05.350" style="s2">was thinking the other day some</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.310" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">journalist asked me why the audience why</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.350" end="00:16:08.620" style="s2">people are responding so positively to</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:11.350" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying the young men for</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:13.690" style="s2">example and I thought yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.350" end="00:16:16.750" style="s2">question says well I&#39;m actually on their</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.690" end="00:16:19.060" style="s2">side I&#39;m pretty happy that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.750" end="00:16:21.190" style="s2">happy that they&#39;re not wasting their</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.060" end="00:16:23.140" style="s2">lives I&#39;m really sad to see that people</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.190" end="00:16:24.910" style="s2">are disenchanted and nihilistic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.140" end="00:16:27.910" style="s2">depressed and anxious and aimless and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.910" end="00:16:30.010" style="s2">and perverse and vengeful and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.910" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">those things it&#39;s terrible and then to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.010" end="00:16:35.140" style="s2">see people question whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.180" style="s2">necessary and then to start to rise out</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.140" end="00:16:39.970" style="s2">of it it&#39;s like it&#39;s so fun like last</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.180" end="00:16:40.810" style="s2">night I was at after my talk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.970" end="00:16:47.470" style="s2">overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.810" end="00:16:49.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t usually think about these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.470" end="00:16:51.640" style="s2">but I was I was after my talk last night</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.570" end="00:16:54.220" style="s2">and so all these people line up and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.640" end="00:16:55.390" style="s2">know they have their 15 15 seconds with</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.220" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">me and they&#39;re kind of tentative they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.390" end="00:16:58.120" style="s2">excited and a tentative when they come</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:16:59.830" style="s2">up to talk to me and then they have you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.120" end="00:17:01.030" style="s2">know 15 seconds of time to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.830" end="00:17:03.339" style="s2">something I&#39;m really listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.030" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">and they&#39;re hesitant about whether or</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.339" end="00:17:07.240" style="s2">not to share the good news about their</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">life you know and I think it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.240" end="00:17:13.089" style="s2">because when people share good news</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:16.660" style="s2">about their life people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.089" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">necessarily respond positively you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.660" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">they don&#39;t get encouragement and people</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">need so little encouragement it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:25.240" style="s2">unbelievable and so there comes</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:26.980" style="s2">something good and I&#39;m like ah that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.240" end="00:17:28.390" style="s2">good you know somebody says well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.980" end="00:17:30.040" style="s2">getting along way better with my father</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.390" end="00:17:34.179" style="s2">I haven&#39;t seen him for 10 years and now</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.040" end="00:17:36.100" style="s2">we get along great and then the power of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.179" end="00:17:38.710" style="s2">that you can&#39;t overstate the power of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.100" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">that for individuals to get their life</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.710" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">together the individual is an</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:44.620" style="s2">unbelievably powerful force and every</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:46.300" style="s2">single person who gets their act</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.620" end="00:17:49.630" style="s2">together a little bit has the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.300" end="00:17:51.880" style="s2">to spread that around them it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.630" end="00:17:57.070" style="s2">chain reaction and so it&#39;s a lovely</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.880" end="00:17:58.570" style="s2">thing to see and that&#39;s fantastic my</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.070" end="00:18:00.520" style="s2">observation of atheists would be they</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.570" end="00:18:01.929" style="s2">don&#39;t live like atheists they don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.520" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">as though they really believe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.929" end="00:18:05.920" style="s2">just a cosmic accident and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">purpose well you are most of them the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.920" end="00:18:09.740" style="s2">best of them I have a lot of respect for</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:12.200" style="s2">the atheists generally because</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.740" end="00:18:14.780" style="s2">they&#39;ve generally thought a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.200" end="00:18:17.570" style="s2">about this situation and and struggled</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.780" end="00:18:19.880" style="s2">with it more than the complacent</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:22.370" style="s2">fundamentalists you know who wallpaper</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.880" end="00:18:23.780" style="s2">over their doubts with with with over</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.370" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">statements about their belief the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.780" end="00:18:28.490" style="s2">atheists you know the word Isaac means</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:30.710" style="s2">or Israel the word Israel means he who</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.490" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">struggles with God it&#39;s like well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.710" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">not obvious that it&#39;s not the atheists</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">you know they&#39;re struggling away it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:38.630" style="s2">like they&#39;re obsessed with it even and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.309" style="s2">so they have God more on their mind than</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.630" end="00:18:42.980" style="s2">the typical person who&#39;s a believer and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.309" end="00:18:44.420" style="s2">so it it&#39;s interesting too because</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.980" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">there&#39;s been this little community</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.420" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">developed around my biblical lectures in</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.429" style="s2">particular of people who call themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:51.650" style="s2">Christian atheists which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.429" end="00:18:53.720" style="s2">quite remarkable so if I lay out the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.650" end="00:18:55.370" style="s2">rationale for the Christian ethic which</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.720" end="00:18:57.860" style="s2">is something like pick up your damn</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.370" end="00:18:59.960" style="s2">cross and struggle uphill which is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.860" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">really good message they think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.960" end="00:19:02.750" style="s2">well that makes a lot of sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:05.390" style="s2">well I don&#39;t need the metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.750" end="00:19:08.179" style="s2">baggage it&#39;s like well maybe you do and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.390" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t but even to pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.179" end="00:19:13.160" style="s2">the practical utility of that idea which</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:15.500" style="s2">is overwhelming that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.160" end="00:19:17.570" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent start so I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.500" end="00:19:19.340" style="s2">follow on that then so it strikes me a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.570" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">lot of young people and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:21.910" style="s2">enormous livia their credit and guys the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">heart I think of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.910" end="00:19:25.850" style="s2">they&#39;re told that all morality is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:27.530" style="s2">relative</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.850" end="00:19:29.450" style="s2">they don&#39;t live that way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.530" end="00:19:31.370" style="s2">actually looking for truth don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:33.410" style="s2">well if you live that way everyone hates</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.370" end="00:19:35.720" style="s2">you you know but that&#39;s the creed that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.410" end="00:19:38.059" style="s2">oh yes yes but that&#39;s a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.720" end="00:19:39.740" style="s2">how you who you are can be out of sync</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.059" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">about with how you represent yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:44.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like I was walking through the arc</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:45.559" style="s2">with I was walking through these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.030" end="00:19:47.540" style="s2">with the audience last night it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.559" end="00:19:49.429" style="s2">well how do we treat each other when</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.540" end="00:19:51.020" style="s2">things work you know and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.429" end="00:19:52.340" style="s2">treat yourself well first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.020" end="00:19:54.590" style="s2">have to treat yourself like you matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.340" end="00:19:56.750" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t then you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.590" end="00:19:59.900" style="s2">care of yourself and you become vengeful</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.750" end="00:20:01.429" style="s2">and and and cruel and you you take you</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.900" end="00:20:03.380" style="s2">take it out on people around you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.429" end="00:20:04.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not a positive force none of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.380" end="00:20:05.630" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.040" end="00:20:07.250" style="s2">so you suffer more and so does everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.630" end="00:20:09.290" style="s2">around you and there&#39;s a malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.250" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">that enters into it none of that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.290" end="00:20:12.740" style="s2">so that&#39;s what happens if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">treat yourself like you matter and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.740" end="00:20:14.960" style="s2">what happens if you don&#39;t treat other</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">people like they matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.960" end="00:20:20.840" style="s2">well you lie to them you cheat them you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:22.760" style="s2">steal you you you enter into impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.840" end="00:20:23.539" style="s2">relationships with them they can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.760" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.539" end="00:20:27.139" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t go anywhere they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">you you you end up alone at best and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.139" end="00:20:33.649" style="s2">maybe like incarcerated at worst like</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:35.779" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work and so you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.649" end="00:20:37.999" style="s2">people around you who thrive regardless</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.779" end="00:20:40.460" style="s2">of what they say they act out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.999" end="00:20:42.499" style="s2">proposition that everyone matters and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.460" end="00:20:45.799" style="s2">then you have a functional society and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.499" end="00:20:47.720" style="s2">think okay well if if if when you act</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.799" end="00:20:49.309" style="s2">out the proposition that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.720" end="00:20:51.169" style="s2">matters you have a functional society</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.309" end="00:20:53.269" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s evidence that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.169" end="00:20:55.820" style="s2">proposition is true it&#39;s like I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.269" end="00:20:57.529" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s true I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.820" end="00:21:00.289" style="s2">that the individual has a spark of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.529" end="00:21:03.289" style="s2">divinity within him or her I think there</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.289" end="00:21:05.629" style="s2">isn&#39;t a more true way of saying that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.289" end="00:21:06.919" style="s2">if you act that out well this is goes</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.629" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">back to the idea that you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.919" end="00:21:10.849" style="s2">about potential which is also something</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:14.119" style="s2">I&#39;ve discussed with my audiences a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.849" end="00:21:17.509" style="s2">it&#39;s like we don&#39;t act like we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.119" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">material reality we act like we face a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.509" end="00:21:22.549" style="s2">landscape of potential an external</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:24.859" style="s2">landscape of potential with an internal</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.549" end="00:21:27.169" style="s2">reservoir of potential that&#39;s how we act</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.859" end="00:21:29.629" style="s2">and then we call each other out on it we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.169" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">say things like well you&#39;re not living</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.629" end="00:21:32.479" style="s2">up to your potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:34.340" style="s2">and persons go so yeah well I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.479" end="00:21:34.940" style="s2">like well what do you mean by that what</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.340" end="00:21:36.919" style="s2">do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.940" end="00:21:38.869" style="s2">well you mean there&#39;s more to you than</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.919" end="00:21:40.700" style="s2">meets the eye even though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.869" end="00:21:42.830" style="s2">measurable right it&#39;s not tangible</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:44.779" style="s2">it&#39;s just possibility but everyone acts</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.830" end="00:21:46.940" style="s2">as that as though that&#39;s a reality and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.779" end="00:21:49.909" style="s2">we all act as if we all act as if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.940" end="00:21:53.720" style="s2">make choices about what reality to bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.909" end="00:21:55.369" style="s2">into being we punish ourselves for our</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.720" end="00:21:58.849" style="s2">moral errors and and other people as</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.369" end="00:22:01.129" style="s2">well we act out this this ethic that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.849" end="00:22:03.169" style="s2">puts us each at the center of being as</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.129" end="00:22:05.029" style="s2">active participants in the world that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.169" end="00:22:07.159" style="s2">want to bring forward everyone acts that</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.029" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">way and if we don&#39;t then things go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.159" end="00:22:11.239" style="s2">hell instantly so it&#39;s like well what do</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:13.279" style="s2">we believe this is the argument I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.239" end="00:22:14.539" style="s2">with people like Sam Harris the atheist</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.279" end="00:22:16.389" style="s2">types it&#39;s like yeah you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.539" end="00:22:19.059" style="s2">atheist now it&#39;s like you&#39;re Christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.389" end="00:22:21.259" style="s2">judeo-christian let&#39;s say to the court</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.059" end="00:22:23.330" style="s2">you just don&#39;t understand it you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.259" end="00:22:25.879" style="s2">don&#39;t realize it and it&#39;s understandable</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.330" end="00:22:27.769" style="s2">but it&#39;s not helpful this idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.879" end="00:22:28.669" style="s2">put forward of a spark of divinity in</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.769" end="00:22:31.580" style="s2">every human being</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.669" end="00:22:33.590" style="s2">surely lies at the heart of the miracle</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.580" end="00:22:35.030" style="s2">of Western freedom the idea that every</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.590" end="00:22:37.430" style="s2">individual has Worth</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.030" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">and dignity and standing it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.430" end="00:22:41.780" style="s2">that killed slavery slavery is a</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.810" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">from it yeah but because it doesn&#39;t suit</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.010" end="00:24:19.760" style="s2">to me in many ways is between what might</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.050" end="00:24:22.850" style="s2">be called freedom and fear damper</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.760" end="00:24:24.530" style="s2">fairness yeah and equality the quality</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.850" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">sounds terrific</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.530" end="00:24:30.620" style="s2">yep but we&#39;ve actually seen what happens</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:32.150" style="s2">in societies where they set a quality up</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.620" end="00:24:34.100" style="s2">as the ultimate goal they became</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.150" end="00:24:35.660" style="s2">terrible place what doesn&#39;t that happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.100" end="00:24:37.130" style="s2">I think this is it sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.660" end="00:24:40.640" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s I think that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.130" end="00:24:43.340" style="s2">part of the the whitewashing is we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.640" end="00:24:45.560" style="s2">understand how one of our primary moral</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.340" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">intuitions which might be fairness let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.560" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">say can transform itself into</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:52.250" style="s2">something so utterly murderous when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.750" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">played out on a large political stage</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.250" end="00:24:56.360" style="s2">and I think because we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:58.100" style="s2">that I mean look there&#39;s reasons to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.360" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2">on the left there are temperamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.100" end="00:25:03.740" style="s2">reasons first so a lot of your political</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">preference is influenced let&#39;s say by</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.740" end="00:25:07.040" style="s2">your temperament and a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:09.350" style="s2">temperament is influenced by biological</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.040" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">factors so there are temperamental</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.350" end="00:25:12.410" style="s2">reasons to be on the left people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">on the left end to be higher in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.410" end="00:25:15.560" style="s2">creativity and lower in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:18.040" style="s2">conscientiousness for example those are</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.560" end="00:25:20.630" style="s2">the two best predictors but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.040" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">practical reasons to be on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.630" end="00:25:25.400" style="s2">one of the practical reasons are that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:27.710" style="s2">human societies which tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.400" end="00:25:30.110" style="s2">hierarchical like all animal societies</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.710" end="00:25:32.090" style="s2">or almost all animal societies produce</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.110" end="00:25:34.370" style="s2">inequality as they go about their</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.090" end="00:25:37.550" style="s2">business and inequality is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.370" end="00:25:40.010" style="s2">quite painful no one likes it nobody no</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.550" end="00:25:43.280" style="s2">rich capitalist walks down a busy urban</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.010" end="00:25:44.900" style="s2">street and sees a starving homeless</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.280" end="00:25:46.970" style="s2">person who&#39;s clearly mentally ill</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.900" end="00:25:49.550" style="s2">suffering madly and thinks that evening</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.970" end="00:25:52.670" style="s2">that inequality is okay no one thinks</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.550" end="00:25:54.410" style="s2">that no one&#39;s for poverty right and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.670" end="00:25:56.420" style="s2">we have this moral intuition that would</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.410" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">be better if the downtrodden were lifted</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.420" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">up and it&#39;s difficult to discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:02.390" style="s2">between that and an equality narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:06.110" style="s2">and so I think part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.390" end="00:26:08.900" style="s2">we can&#39;t face the the lesson of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.110" end="00:26:11.210" style="s2">century is because it&#39;s the left that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.900" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">mostly has to face the lesson and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.210" end="00:26:14.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to reconcile their deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:16.490" style="s2">intuitions about the injustice of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.750" end="00:26:19.190" style="s2">inequality with the fact that when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.490" end="00:26:21.560" style="s2">put that doctrine in at work into into</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.190" end="00:26:24.290" style="s2">operation as a political tool you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.560" end="00:26:26.060" style="s2">instantly stack up millions of corpses</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.290" end="00:26:28.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what to do with that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.060" end="00:26:31.340" style="s2">so we just avoid it and that&#39;s well and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.820" end="00:26:33.410" style="s2">then of course we risk replicating it</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.340" end="00:26:35.660" style="s2">which is not good that&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.410" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">tactical move well that&#39;s the problem if</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.660" end="00:26:39.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t learn from history we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:42.260" style="s2">destined to repeat it I entirely accept</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.920" end="00:26:44.030" style="s2">and some Australians might be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.260" end="00:26:45.770" style="s2">by this they say no I can&#39;t understand a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.030" end="00:26:48.440" style="s2">lefties perspective I think I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.770" end="00:26:51.110" style="s2">understand the nobility of wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.440" end="00:26:52.700" style="s2">ensure that everyone is respected as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.110" end="00:26:54.550" style="s2">full member of the handover the human</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.700" end="00:26:56.930" style="s2">family of our culture and our society</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.550" end="00:26:58.520" style="s2">but this is where it gets so tricky and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.930" end="00:27:00.260" style="s2">it&#39;s where I think many young people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.520" end="00:27:01.940" style="s2">starting to wake up they&#39;re being sold a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.260" end="00:27:02.210" style="s2">pup do you have that expression in</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.940" end="00:27:03.920" style="s2">Canada</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.210" end="00:27:06.230" style="s2">no that&#39;s all the pup no it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.920" end="00:27:08.600" style="s2">DAAD mm-hmm see yeah there&#39;s no sound</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.230" end="00:27:12.350" style="s2">idea right that many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.600" end="00:27:15.080" style="s2">sound attractive don&#39;t necessarily work</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.350" end="00:27:18.950" style="s2">so perhaps we need to be arguing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.080" end="00:27:21.950" style="s2">case for freedom and fairness which will</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.950" end="00:27:24.980" style="s2">the produce at least a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.950" end="00:27:28.070" style="s2">equality of opportunity rather than</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.980" end="00:27:32.360" style="s2">arguing for equality which history tells</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.070" end="00:27:34.310" style="s2">us tends to severely erode freedom yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.360" end="00:27:37.070" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s a harder sale though</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.310" end="00:27:39.260" style="s2">because but it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.070" end="00:27:41.140" style="s2">compassion immediately thoughtlessly</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.260" end="00:27:43.910" style="s2">right and there and since that&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.140" end="00:27:46.390" style="s2">instantaneously positive moral virtue</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.910" end="00:27:48.380" style="s2">and you don&#39;t need sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.390" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">argumentation to buttress it it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.380" end="00:27:53.950" style="s2">more difficult to make a cold and a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:56.300" style="s2">little case that the the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.950" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">freedom first let&#39;s say freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.300" end="00:28:00.860" style="s2">responsibility first lifts the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:03.110" style="s2">better it&#39;s a cold argument and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.860" end="00:28:05.000" style="s2">requires rationality to parse through so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.110" end="00:28:07.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a harder sale I would argue though</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.000" end="00:28:09.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not just rationality its history if</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.220" end="00:28:12.350" style="s2">you bring rationality and honesty to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.620" end="00:28:14.420" style="s2">study of history I think I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.350" end="00:28:15.590" style="s2">case is actually quite compelling I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.420" end="00:28:17.870" style="s2">think it is too fact I think it&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.590" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">and sharp I think it&#39;s it&#39;s well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.870" end="00:28:21.650" style="s2">a book that I&#39;ve just been reading that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:24.260" style="s2">I would recommend by a man named Walter</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.650" end="00:28:26.300" style="s2">shy Dell and he wrote a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.260" end="00:28:28.490" style="s2">great leveler which I really like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.300" end="00:28:30.710" style="s2">an empirical analysis of inequality and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.490" end="00:28:35.060" style="s2">he had his research questions were</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.710" end="00:28:37.940" style="s2">something like well what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.060" end="00:28:40.400" style="s2">phenomena of inequality - what can you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.940" end="00:28:42.980" style="s2">attribute it and what if anything can we</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.400" end="00:28:45.920" style="s2">do to ameliorate it okay so the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.980" end="00:28:47.690" style="s2">answer is something akin to what I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.920" end="00:28:49.430" style="s2">in the first rule in my book twelve</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.690" end="00:28:51.830" style="s2">rules for life which is well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.430" end="00:28:53.680" style="s2">lay hierarchy and inequality at the feet</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.830" end="00:28:56.060" style="s2">of Western civilization or capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.680" end="00:28:59.660" style="s2">we&#39;re done with that argument that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.060" end="00:29:01.280" style="s2">wrong animal societies are hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.660" end="00:29:03.500" style="s2">and they produce unequal distributions</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.280" end="00:29:05.570" style="s2">and yet there&#39;s evidence for that in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.500" end="00:29:07.700" style="s2">biological realm going back a third of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.570" end="00:29:09.680" style="s2">billion years and that&#39;s happened for so</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.700" end="00:29:12.650" style="s2">long that your nervous system has</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.680" end="00:29:14.330" style="s2">primarily adapted to it so it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.650" end="00:29:15.570" style="s2">reality and blaming it on capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.330" end="00:29:17.669" style="s2">it&#39;s like no</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.489" end="00:29:25.109" style="s2">people tend to stack up is zero that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.190" end="00:29:27.269" style="s2">bad thing because it destabilizes your</p>

<p begin="00:29:35.429" end="00:29:39.359" style="s2">social science evidence for that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.049" end="00:29:41.009" style="s2">clear alright so we want to ameliorate</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.359" end="00:29:42.419" style="s2">inequality to some degree because we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.009" end="00:29:44.700" style="s2">don&#39;t want people to stack up at zero</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.419" end="00:29:46.710" style="s2">and destabilize the society and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.700" end="00:29:47.940" style="s2">want young men in particular to become</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.710" end="00:29:50.039" style="s2">violent fine</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.940" end="00:29:52.739" style="s2">so then shy Dale takes another tack it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.039" end="00:29:55.529" style="s2">like hit his observations he looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.739" end="00:29:57.359" style="s2">Neolithic grave sites for signs of</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.529" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">inequality and you see what people are</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.359" end="00:30:00.989" style="s2">buried with and in one of his cases</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:02.220" style="s2">there&#39;s 200 people in a grave and one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.989" end="00:30:04.049" style="s2">them has a hundred and ninety pounds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.220" end="00:30:05.609" style="s2">gold and the next richest person has</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.049" end="00:30:07.739" style="s2">like four ounces of gold and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.609" end="00:30:09.570" style="s2">everyone else has none it&#39;s like so even</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.739" end="00:30:11.429" style="s2">in these Neolithic societies inequality</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.570" end="00:30:13.769" style="s2">was the rule hunter-gatherer societies</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.429" end="00:30:15.090" style="s2">are the same way except the inequality</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.769" end="00:30:17.070" style="s2">isn&#39;t material because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.090" end="00:30:19.320" style="s2">surplus inequalities everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.070" end="00:30:22.379" style="s2">okay so then she&#39;ll asks two other</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.320" end="00:30:26.909" style="s2">questions one is well how has it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.379" end="00:30:30.359" style="s2">generally been reduced pestilence and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.909" end="00:30:32.389" style="s2">war that&#39;s it so you can reduce</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.359" end="00:30:34.409" style="s2">inequality if you demolish everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.389" end="00:30:36.779" style="s2">because that just brings everyone down</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.409" end="00:30:39.330" style="s2">to zero but the inequality is less and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.779" end="00:30:41.789" style="s2">then he does an empirical analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.330" end="00:30:44.299" style="s2">asks a very interesting practical</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.789" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">question which is imagine that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.299" end="00:30:49.739" style="s2">totted up the inequality coefficients of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:51.570" style="s2">the right-wing societies and you did the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.739" end="00:30:53.009" style="s2">same with the left-wing societies is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.570" end="00:30:54.779" style="s2">there a difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.009" end="00:30:57.059" style="s2">inequality coefficients and you&#39;d hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.779" end="00:30:58.950" style="s2">yes because you&#39;d hope that what would</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.059" end="00:31:00.599" style="s2">happen as a consequence of activity on</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.950" end="00:31:03.599" style="s2">the left would be that something would</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.599" end="00:31:04.769" style="s2">actually occur to ameliorate inequality</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.599" end="00:31:09.659" style="s2">you found no evidence for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.769" end="00:31:12.409" style="s2">whatsoever so the left is sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.659" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">the catastrophe of inequality let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.409" end="00:31:18.840" style="s2">but their compassion oriented doctrines</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.129" style="s2">designed to ameliorate that on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.840" end="00:31:21.809" style="s2">positive side there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.129" end="00:31:23.429" style="s2">resentment on the left to that and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.809" end="00:31:25.349" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sweep that under the under</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.429" end="00:31:28.290" style="s2">the rug their compassion oriented</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.349" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">policies do not produce an</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">of goods so it&#39;s a way bigger problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.660" end="00:31:42.060" style="s2">than we think so so and and putting into</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:43.770" style="s2">place these these thoughtless</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.060" end="00:31:45.720" style="s2">compassionate doctrines let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:47.160" style="s2">putting them in place again it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.720" end="00:31:48.540" style="s2">gonna produce exactly the same outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.160" end="00:31:50.340" style="s2">that were produced all through the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.540" end="00:31:52.140" style="s2">century we must learn are going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.340" end="00:31:55.080" style="s2">the wisdom of the past back to the table</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.140" end="00:31:57.480" style="s2">of today if we&#39;re to find our way out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.080" end="00:31:58.500" style="s2">the malaise it&#39;s affecting the West I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.480" end="00:32:00.930" style="s2">think to a better place</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.500" end="00:32:02.430" style="s2">but before we do that yeah explore that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.930" end="00:32:04.830" style="s2">line of thinking let&#39;s go back to</p>

<p begin="00:32:04.830" end="00:32:08.810" style="s2">through the age I think you make that</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.060" end="00:32:54.570" style="s2">to a society which set equality as its</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.270" end="00:32:57.420" style="s2">goal soviet russia and in the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.570" end="00:32:59.880" style="s2">that equality killed 60 or 70 million</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.420" end="00:33:04.020" style="s2">that&#39;s the estimate of those who</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.020" end="00:33:07.290" style="s2">lost their freedom that of those who</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.290" end="00:33:11.310" style="s2">because in the soviet union if you dared</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.310" end="00:33:15.990" style="s2">for you then you were instantly a</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.140" end="00:33:31.770" style="s2">well exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.160" end="00:33:32.750" style="s2">yeah but let&#39;s come to Alexander</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.750" end="00:33:37.710" style="s2">we know a lot about what happened</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.710" end="00:33:42.300" style="s2">global figure when I was a young man and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:44.760" style="s2">I read his book The Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.300" end="00:33:47.220" style="s2">here is this man he describes the</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.220" end="00:33:52.410" style="s2">because he disagrees he converted he was</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.100" end="00:33:54.360" style="s2">originally a supporter of communism he</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.410" end="00:33:56.820" style="s2">came to see how evil it was and how</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.820" end="00:34:03.110" style="s2">having a different view to the state</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:07.320" style="s2">ordained insistence that everything was</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.110" end="00:34:09.660" style="s2">terrific huh and he writes unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:12.120" style="s2">that lying on his prison bunk one day</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.660" end="00:34:14.429" style="s2">listening to the guards beat up a fellow</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.429" end="00:34:18.750" style="s2">found freedom when he realized the</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.750" end="00:34:23.429" style="s2">in fact didn&#39;t lie between captor and</p>

<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:48.090" style="s2">important that we understand that comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.610" style="s2">back to what you said I think when it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.930" style="s2">about their own transgressions I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:00.450" style="s2">you ask someone to sit for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.930" end="00:35:02.790" style="s2">and think okay well what mistakes have</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.450" end="00:35:04.440" style="s2">you made in your life it&#39;s like that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.790" end="00:35:07.230" style="s2">come up pretty quickly and you can even</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:26.210" style="s2">well the conundrum in then he said to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:27.650" style="s2">like and he underwent the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.210" end="00:37:30.980" style="s2">process of Metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.650" end="00:37:33.140" style="s2">which is to go over your it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.980" end="00:37:34.910" style="s2">confession essentially and repentance</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.140" end="00:37:36.770" style="s2">wasn&#39;t mediated by a religious structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.910" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">in Solzhenitsyn&#39;s case but it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.770" end="00:37:39.860" style="s2">exactly the same process and he knew</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.530" style="s2">that perfectly well I&#39;m not making this</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.860" end="00:37:45.650" style="s2">up he said when he was in the prisons</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.530" end="00:37:48.650" style="s2">and decided that he was at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.650" end="00:37:50.210" style="s2">to blame for his own imprisonment and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.650" end="00:37:52.010" style="s2">the imprisonment of everyone around him</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.210" end="00:37:53.570" style="s2">that that was his fault or at least his</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.010" end="00:37:55.370" style="s2">restore both his fault and his</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.570" end="00:37:57.290" style="s2">responsibility that he was going to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:37:59.030" style="s2">that on he said the first thing he did</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.290" end="00:38:02.390" style="s2">was he went over his life with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.030" end="00:38:04.760" style="s2">fine-tooth comb in memory and his goal</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.390" end="00:38:07.700" style="s2">was okay I&#39;m gonna remember everything I</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.760" end="00:38:09.370" style="s2">did when in my life up to now where I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.700" end="00:38:12.250" style="s2">did something that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.370" end="00:38:15.520" style="s2">to be wrong and not because of some</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.250" end="00:38:17.110" style="s2">external Authority defining it as wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.520" end="00:38:20.350" style="s2">but in relationship to his own</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.110" end="00:38:21.430" style="s2">conscience right and then he was going</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.350" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">to determine if there was some way that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.430" end="00:38:26.260" style="s2">could be rectified now to atone for it</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.090" style="s2">right - to become at one with it again</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.260" end="00:38:30.520" style="s2">and so that was part of the process he</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.090" end="00:38:31.810" style="s2">undertook and the concluding consequence</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.520" end="00:38:34.140" style="s2">of that was that he wrote the Gulag</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.810" end="00:38:37.690" style="s2">Archipelago which is a absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.140" end="00:38:40.180" style="s2">overwhelming piece that blew the</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.180" end="00:38:44.830" style="s2">of communism permanently right once</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.530" style="s2">soldier but until now we say to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.830" end="00:38:49.630" style="s2">trying to gloss over academia seems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.530" end="00:38:52.360" style="s2">be full of people who want a soft pedal</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.630" end="00:38:56.290" style="s2">right now and reinstitute this naive</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.360" end="00:38:57.940" style="s2">view that if we just create the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.290" end="00:38:59.530" style="s2">institutions everybody will behave</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.530" end="00:39:02.290" style="s2">will be okay they want to enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.970" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">yeah won&#39;t say that but that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.290" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">want to do they want to enforce it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:07.600" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s easy and it&#39;s only a</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.600" end="00:39:11.370" style="s2">happened yeah well are we mad</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.490" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">well we&#39;re characterized by inertia and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.710" end="00:39:20.380" style="s2">ignorance it&#39;s not easy to it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:24.370" style="s2">to understand history it&#39;s especially</p>

<p begin="00:39:24.370" end="00:39:31.330" style="s2">read I had a client at one point who was</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:33.310" style="s2">an unbelievably naive person you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.330" end="00:39:35.050" style="s2">overestimate her naivety no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.310" end="00:39:37.810" style="s2">hard you tried her parents taught her</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.050" end="00:39:40.330" style="s2">that adults were angels literally and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.810" end="00:39:43.860" style="s2">she believed that in in a strange sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.330" end="00:39:46.630" style="s2">when I met her she was in her 20s and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.860" end="00:39:49.060" style="s2">and and she had this extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.630" end="00:39:51.790" style="s2">naive view of people and had been hurt</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.060" end="00:39:53.980" style="s2">and if you&#39;re very naive and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.790" end="00:39:55.810" style="s2">hurt by someone you often disintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.980" end="00:39:56.770" style="s2">because it blows your world apart that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.810" end="00:39:58.810" style="s2">what it&#39;s happened to her</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.770" end="00:40:01.600" style="s2">and I said she had a university degree</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.810" end="00:40:03.310" style="s2">and I said well look like I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.600" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">liberal arts I said didn&#39;t you read any</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.310" end="00:40:08.830" style="s2">history and she said well yeah I said</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">well did like didn&#39;t that disturb the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.830" end="00:40:12.940" style="s2">whole adults er Angels hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:15.610" style="s2">she said well I read it but I just</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.940" end="00:40:17.770" style="s2">compartmentalized it and that gave me</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.610" end="00:40:20.380" style="s2">the key to what was wrong with her and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.770" end="00:40:22.570" style="s2">we successfully dealt with it but I had</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.380" end="00:40:25.240" style="s2">her to begin her</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.570" end="00:40:26.710" style="s2">have cure oddly enough because she had</p>

<p begin="00:40:30.220" end="00:40:34.450" style="s2">worldview had been shattered by the hand</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.960" end="00:40:39.550" style="s2">of malevolence I had to read a book</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.450" end="00:40:43.570" style="s2">called ordinary men by Browning and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.550" end="00:40:45.550" style="s2">a study of these Polish policemen German</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.410" end="00:55:09.730" style="s2">was right when this started and I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.750" end="00:55:12.610" style="s2">it was I think it was Malcolm Muggeridge</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.730" end="00:55:14.170" style="s2">who was reporting on that for for a UK</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.610" end="00:55:15.790" style="s2">newspaper whose name escapes me at the</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.790" end="00:55:19.390" style="s2">you know and no one paid attention no</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.710" end="00:55:21.010" style="s2">one paid attention towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.390" end="00:55:22.780" style="s2">his life he warned that the West is in</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.780" end="00:55:27.220" style="s2">and I wonder whether in fact he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.970" end="00:55:28.300" style="s2">being very appreciate and you and I want</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.220" end="00:55:30.910" style="s2">to stop that happening for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.300" end="00:55:32.920" style="s2">our young people for the sake of</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.920" end="00:55:37.450" style="s2">already we&#39;ve seen need to do it he</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.690" end="00:55:39.640" style="s2">fired it that thing&#39;s history should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.450" end="00:55:41.110" style="s2">like science in the sense that it ought</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.640" end="00:55:45.430" style="s2">to be objective it ought to be told</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.110" end="00:55:46.740" style="s2">truthfully it ought not to be used to</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.950" end="00:55:55.240" style="s2">of society well this is also white see</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:55:56.650" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been trying to do about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.240" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">because I&#39;ve thought this through a long</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.650" end="00:56:02.020" style="s2">time ago well I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:04.330" style="s2">I think the group identity game ends in</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.020" end="00:56:06.670" style="s2">blood doesn&#39;t matter who plays it left</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.330" end="00:56:09.160" style="s2">wingers play a blood right wingers play</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.670" end="00:56:11.350" style="s2">it blood and lots of it not just a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.160" end="00:56:13.150" style="s2">little bit you can&#39;t play the identity</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.350" end="00:56:17.410" style="s2">politics game well so what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.150" end="00:56:19.960" style="s2">instead you you live the mythologically</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.410" end="00:56:22.390" style="s2">heroic life as an individual that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.960" end="00:56:25.000" style="s2">right place to work and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.390" end="00:56:26.260" style="s2">message of the West is that we figured</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:29.050" style="s2">that out we figured out that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.260" end="00:56:31.150" style="s2">collective identity was not the pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.050" end="00:56:32.920" style="s2">statement that the individual not the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.150" end="00:56:35.500" style="s2">collective identities have no value</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.920" end="00:56:37.510" style="s2">obviously family has value and and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.500" end="00:56:39.730" style="s2">and your organization&#39;s have value all</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.510" end="00:56:42.850" style="s2">of that that&#39;s not the issue the issue</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.730" end="00:56:44.320" style="s2">is what&#39;s the paramount value what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.850" end="00:56:46.540" style="s2">metric by which people should be</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.320" end="00:56:48.220" style="s2">measured and the answer is they should</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.540" end="00:56:50.020" style="s2">be measured as individuals as if they</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.220" end="00:56:51.820" style="s2">have a divine soul there should be</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.020" end="00:56:54.220" style="s2">measured in that manner but it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.820" end="00:56:56.170" style="s2">a selfish thing that is to say if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.220" end="00:56:58.870" style="s2">recognize I have Worth and dignity I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.170" end="00:57:00.820" style="s2">obliged to recognize it so to you I</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.870" end="00:57:03.190" style="s2">think you can&#39;t recognize that you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.820" end="00:57:05.530" style="s2">intrinsic worth and dignity without also</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.190" end="00:57:08.020" style="s2">doing without also recognizing in others</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.530" end="00:57:09.670" style="s2">and and vice versa I don&#39;t that I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.020" end="00:57:12.490" style="s2">recognize the worth of another person</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.670" end="00:57:14.650" style="s2">without without stumbling on to the idea</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.650" end="00:57:18.040" style="s2">myself when did you think well everyone</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.390" end="00:57:20.890" style="s2">would want that but what people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.040" end="00:57:23.650" style="s2">because you&#39;re also charged with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.890" end="00:57:25.150" style="s2">responsibility of your own care as if</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.650" end="00:57:27.630" style="s2">you matter well that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.150" end="00:57:30.910" style="s2">responsibility like it&#39;s a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.630" end="00:57:32.200" style="s2">assume that everything is pointless I</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.910" end="00:57:33.820" style="s2">mean that&#39;s painful in all of that but</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.200" end="00:57:36.760" style="s2">well you don&#39;t bear any responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.820" end="00:57:38.860" style="s2">and no one lives that way no no well not</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.760" end="00:57:41.830" style="s2">for long not for long well if not for</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.860" end="00:57:43.390" style="s2">long exactly but you know and Voltaire&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.830" end="00:57:46.390" style="s2">biographer wasn&#39;t actually Voltaire</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.390" end="00:57:48.130" style="s2">himself it was a lady who read he&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.390" end="00:57:51.430" style="s2">of the many of her biographies of him in</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.130" end="00:57:53.230" style="s2">the 1930s came up with that adage</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.430" end="00:57:55.300" style="s2">summarizing his views that I may</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.230" end="00:57:57.880" style="s2">disagree with you but I&#39;ll defend to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.300" end="00:57:59.350" style="s2">death your right to say it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.880" end="00:58:00.290" style="s2">couple of things implicit in that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.350" end="00:58:02.870" style="s2">seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.290" end="00:58:05.090" style="s2">important so I may disagree with you but</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.870" end="00:58:08.510" style="s2">you have dignity and standing and Worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.090" end="00:58:09.620" style="s2">and a right to put your view that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.510" end="00:58:12.320" style="s2">first thing I&#39;m respecting the other</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.620" end="00:58:14.450" style="s2">person oh you should crave it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.320" end="00:58:17.000" style="s2">the second thing it implies is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.450" end="00:58:18.500" style="s2">idea on the table that&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.000" end="00:58:20.180" style="s2">two reasons one is we need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.500" end="00:58:21.800" style="s2">debate about that not a tacher person</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.180" end="00:58:24.950" style="s2">who put it there show some respect for</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.800" end="00:58:27.350" style="s2">the second thing is it&#39;s only by honest</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.950" end="00:58:28.970" style="s2">debate that you find the best way</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.350" end="00:58:30.860" style="s2">forward that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.970" end="00:58:32.420" style="s2">then that ties back to the discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.860" end="00:58:34.430" style="s2">had about the purpose of memory and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.420" end="00:58:37.400" style="s2">purpose of historical education it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.430" end="00:58:39.530" style="s2">like look there&#39;s a another rule in my</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.400" end="00:58:40.940" style="s2">book which is rule 9 assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.530" end="00:58:41.870" style="s2">person that you&#39;re listening to knows</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.940" end="00:58:44.390" style="s2">something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.870" end="00:58:46.340" style="s2">well they do the person you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.390" end="00:58:47.900" style="s2">to knows some things you don&#39;t you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.340" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">be sure of that now whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.900" end="00:58:51.320" style="s2">can get to them is a different matter</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:53.390" style="s2">but if you do get to them it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.320" end="00:58:54.920" style="s2">deal for you that&#39;s why you want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.390" end="00:58:56.750" style="s2">listen to the other person&#39;s arguments</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.920" end="00:58:58.490" style="s2">is because you&#39;re not everything you</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.250" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">of this seems to be if I disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.099" end="01:00:29.550" style="s2">what you say I&#39;ll paint it as hate</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:32.190" style="s2">speech or challenging to my notions of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.550" end="01:00:33.810" style="s2">diversity and inclusiveness and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.190" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">fight to the death your right to even</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.810" end="01:00:38.220" style="s2">have your say well that&#39;s where hate</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:40.980" style="s2">speech laws are so pernicious it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.220" end="01:00:43.770" style="s2">and that needs to be taken apart first</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.980" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">question is there such a thing as hate</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.770" end="01:00:49.369" style="s2">speech yes obviously people say terrible</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:52.319" style="s2">things reprehensible things</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.369" end="01:00:54.390" style="s2">quasi-criminal things even all the time</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.319" end="01:00:57.240" style="s2">brutal and some of them caused a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.390" end="01:00:58.680" style="s2">trouble so the idea that there&#39;s hateful</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.240" end="01:01:00.150" style="s2">speech it&#39;s like yeah ok that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.680" end="01:01:03.569" style="s2">self-evident no problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.150" end="01:01:05.400" style="s2">well let&#39;s regulate it ok fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.569" end="01:01:09.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s hateful you know maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.400" end="01:01:10.310" style="s2">rather that there wasn&#39;t any of it ok no</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.480" end="01:01:13.859" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.310" end="01:01:15.960" style="s2">who defines hate well we&#39;ll worry about</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.859" end="01:01:18.420" style="s2">that later it&#39;s like no he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.960" end="01:01:21.569" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the problem here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.420" end="01:01:23.970" style="s2">answer to who defines hate those people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.569" end="01:01:26.099" style="s2">that you at least want to have define it</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.970" end="01:01:28.140" style="s2">that would be the inevitable consequence</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.099" end="01:01:29.250" style="s2">of the legislation because sensible</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.140" end="01:01:32.790" style="s2">people won&#39;t have anything to do with</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.250" end="01:01:35.940" style="s2">that like people who are power mad will</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.790" end="01:01:38.040" style="s2">gravitate to that domain to make an</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.940" end="01:01:39.750" style="s2">ethical case to exercise their</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.040" end="01:01:41.700" style="s2">controlling power over the language of</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.750" end="01:01:43.470" style="s2">other people no and I&#39;ve had journalists</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.700" end="01:01:45.540" style="s2">say well what makes you think that your</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.470" end="01:01:47.609" style="s2">right to free speech Trump&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.540" end="01:01:49.710" style="s2">of someone to not be offended and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.609" end="01:01:51.329" style="s2">think that&#39;s really the level of our</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.710" end="01:01:53.520" style="s2">political discourse ok so we&#39;ll run a</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.329" end="01:01:54.930" style="s2">little thought experiment so I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.520" end="01:01:57.210" style="s2">to one person I&#39;m talking to you and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.930" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">rule is I don&#39;t get to offend you ok</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.210" end="01:02:01.319" style="s2">maybe we can still have a discussion</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:03.810" style="s2">about something difficult but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.319" end="01:02:06.119" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to ten people and about an</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.810" end="01:02:07.530" style="s2">important thing now I have to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.119" end="01:02:08.730" style="s2">that I don&#39;t say anything to fight</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.530" end="01:02:10.349" style="s2">despite the fact that this is an</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.730" end="01:02:12.030" style="s2">important and contentious issue that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.349" end="01:02:15.240" style="s2">don&#39;t say anything that offends even one</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.030" end="01:02:16.890" style="s2">of those 10 people ok maybe I can even</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.240" end="01:02:19.589" style="s2">manage that what if I&#39;m talking to a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.890" end="01:02:22.109" style="s2">thousand people there&#39;s going to be</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.109" end="01:02:27.360" style="s2">gonna be someone who&#39;s offended at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.609" end="01:02:29.610" style="s2">mere fact that I exist so it</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.360" end="01:02:31.770" style="s2">an impossible standard it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.610" end="01:02:32.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t say anything offensive okay</p>

<p begin="01:03:49.770" end="01:03:54.050" style="s2">recently made the comment that freedom</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.840" end="01:03:56.340" style="s2">of speech is the most important freedom</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.050" end="01:04:00.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s the freedom by which we</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.340" end="01:04:03.420" style="s2">defend all about other freedoms it</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.510" end="01:04:07.740" style="s2">strikes me that freedom of speech though</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.420" end="01:04:10.620" style="s2">is most important not for the powerful</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.740" end="01:04:13.350" style="s2">or for the elite it&#39;s actually for the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.620" end="01:04:16.080" style="s2">minority groups a free society surely is</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.350" end="01:04:17.430" style="s2">one that allows those who swim against</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.080" end="01:04:20.280" style="s2">the tide and have a different</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.430" end="01:04:26.730" style="s2">perspective the right to do so without</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.280" end="01:04:28.590" style="s2">fear of mob or state sanction I you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.730" end="01:04:30.390" style="s2">had some personally well I gave a talk</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.590" end="01:04:32.670" style="s2">and the University of British Columbia</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.390" end="01:04:34.140" style="s2">about a year ago on it was called a</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.670" end="01:04:35.970" style="s2">left-wing case for freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.140" end="01:04:37.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s really easy to make a</p>

<p begin="01:04:37.500" end="01:04:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like well that&#39;s how it exists have</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.100" end="01:04:45.840" style="s2">make their suffering known right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.470" end="01:04:48.420" style="s2">clearly I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.840" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">that argument even has to be made</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.420" end="01:04:53.580" style="s2">shows you how pathological the radical</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:55.490" style="s2">left has become because it&#39;s clearly the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.580" end="01:04:57.900" style="s2">case that freedom of speech is not</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.490" end="01:05:01.050" style="s2">generally in the interests of the power</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.900" end="01:05:03.420" style="s2">elite right because they already have</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.050" end="01:05:05.460" style="s2">access to to what they need to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.420" end="01:05:07.350" style="s2">their grip on the world let&#39;s say if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.460" end="01:05:08.850" style="s2">look at yes in that manner it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.350" end="01:05:10.860" style="s2">people at the bottom of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.850" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">whose right to expression needs to be</p>

<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.740" style="s2">the debate you don&#39;t need freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.950" end="01:05:18.990" style="s2">speech right right obviously so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.740" end="01:05:20.520" style="s2">always useful for the dispossessed of</p>

<p begin="01:05:39.060" end="01:05:42.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work out because when the two</p>

<p begin="01:05:46.800" end="01:05:50.850" style="s2">equality rights keep trumping everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.300" end="01:05:52.500" style="s2">else and that&#39;s not good it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.850" end="01:05:54.000" style="s2">good reason why you shouldn&#39;t have a</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.290" end="01:06:02.190" style="s2">the freedom of speech you say well</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.970" end="01:06:03.870" style="s2">speech is the the right to freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.190" end="01:06:05.340" style="s2">speech is central because it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.870" end="01:06:07.650" style="s2">by which you defend all the other rights</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.340" end="01:06:10.200" style="s2">well that&#39;s why the idea of logos in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.650" end="01:06:11.820" style="s2">West is the most sacred concept right</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.200" end="01:06:13.530" style="s2">that because oh Christ</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.820" end="01:06:15.960" style="s2">do you think about this psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.530" end="01:06:18.510" style="s2">as Christ is though is the ideal of</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.960" end="01:06:19.800" style="s2">perfection now this is independent of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.510" end="01:06:22.020" style="s2">any religious discussion or any</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.800" end="01:06:23.790" style="s2">historical accuracy doesn&#39;t matter we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.020" end="01:06:26.280" style="s2">looking at this from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.790" end="01:06:28.350" style="s2">the analysis of a myth or a story what</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.280" end="01:06:30.270" style="s2">Christ represents is the perfect</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.350" end="01:06:32.940" style="s2">individual whatever that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.270" end="01:06:34.740" style="s2">now you discuss endlessly what that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.940" end="01:06:36.750" style="s2">but one of the things the West is</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.740" end="01:06:39.180" style="s2">settled on is the idea well that is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.750" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">the perfect individual utters the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.180" end="01:06:44.070" style="s2">truthful speech that makes potential</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:45.990" style="s2">into habitable order does that through</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.070" end="01:06:48.810" style="s2">truth and that&#39;s embedded in the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.990" end="01:06:50.970" style="s2">few sentences in in Genesis for example</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.810" end="01:06:53.730" style="s2">when when when when God brings the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.970" end="01:06:55.590" style="s2">into being so and and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.730" end="01:06:57.840" style="s2">truthful speech that brings the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.590" end="01:07:01.380" style="s2">into being from formless potential also</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.840" end="01:07:03.750" style="s2">characterizes each person that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.380" end="01:07:05.990" style="s2">form our fabrication in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.750" end="01:07:09.500" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of the West it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.990" end="01:07:12.060" style="s2">unbelievably remarkable idea that</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.500" end="01:07:13.680" style="s2">perfection individual perfection is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.060" end="01:07:17.250" style="s2">be found in a relationship with spoken</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.680" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">truth God that&#39;s that&#39;s the great idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.250" end="01:07:23.130" style="s2">well it&#39;s out of that arises the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">observation that there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.130" end="01:07:28.020" style="s2">nothing more central to the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:30.180" style="s2">rights and obligations as well let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.020" end="01:07:33.030" style="s2">then freedom of speech yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.180" end="01:07:35.160" style="s2">absolutely central that&#39;s why Christ is</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.030" end="01:07:37.010" style="s2">the word made flesh the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.160" end="01:07:39.840" style="s2">perfect individual is the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.010" end="01:07:43.770" style="s2">well who speaks truth but also acts out</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.840" end="01:07:45.930" style="s2">the truth of those words it&#39;s very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.770" end="01:07:47.940" style="s2">a it&#39;s a proposition whose merit is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.930" end="01:07:50.220" style="s2">virtually self-evident when you</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.940" end="01:07:52.740" style="s2">understand it in that manner so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.220" end="01:07:54.660" style="s2">people to see assaults on freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.740" end="01:07:56.490" style="s2">speech especially compelled speech well</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.660" end="01:07:58.380" style="s2">that&#39;s where I drew the line in in my</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.490" end="01:08:00.330" style="s2">life it was like purpose well held</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.380" end="01:08:02.220" style="s2">speech legislation in Canada perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.330" end="01:08:04.020" style="s2">that&#39;s why the left is so determined in</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.220" end="01:08:06.150" style="s2">this country to get Christianity out of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.020" end="01:08:07.560" style="s2">the classroom but don&#39;t tell us</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.150" end="01:08:09.030" style="s2">something of the chilling there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.560" end="01:08:10.530" style="s2">doubt that&#39;s why they&#39;re determined I</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.810" end="01:08:17.370" style="s2">male-dominated logos centric it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.470" end="01:08:19.109" style="s2">that is the West</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.370" end="01:08:21.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a logo centric well if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.109" end="01:08:23.609" style="s2">take the West down you remove the idea</p>

<p begin="01:16:21.660" end="01:16:27.660" style="s2">this is driven by very fundamental</p>

<p begin="01:17:22.830" end="01:17:27.270" style="s2">person is very very low now obviously</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.830" end="01:17:29.250" style="s2">there&#39;s some advantages to that because</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.270" end="01:17:30.900" style="s2">great you would devote resources to your</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.390" end="01:17:39.030" style="s2">have every motivation to hover and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.870" end="01:17:43.170" style="s2">you&#39;re also extraordinarily desperate as</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.960" end="01:17:55.800" style="s2">we might say well perhaps overprotective</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.060" end="01:17:57.570" style="s2">parenting is a secondary and unintended</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.870" end="01:18:13.130" style="s2">if you have six kids and there they</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.120" end="01:18:14.660" style="s2">outnumber you right they&#39;re raising each</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.130" end="01:18:16.430" style="s2">other they&#39;re competing and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.660" end="01:18:19.220" style="s2">taking each other down a peg they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.430" end="01:18:21.890" style="s2">there&#39;s no overprotection there but with</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.220" end="01:18:24.800" style="s2">it with a single child landscape or dual</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.890" end="01:18:27.340" style="s2">child landscape mostly a single child</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.800" end="01:18:29.960" style="s2">landscape then you&#39;re gonna over protect</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.340" end="01:18:31.580" style="s2">and then that ethos starts to permeate</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.960" end="01:18:34.100" style="s2">the schools and it starts to permeate</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.580" end="01:18:36.830" style="s2">the higher education institutions as</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.100" end="01:18:39.530" style="s2">those children mature and then that all</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.830" end="01:18:40.490" style="s2">reinforces it not good it&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.530" end="01:18:42.620" style="s2">what to do about it either</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.490" end="01:18:44.300" style="s2">because if it is driven by demographics</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.620" end="01:18:47.210" style="s2">in that in that sense it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.300" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">intractable problem than we think so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.210" end="01:18:50.750" style="s2">did some of that in 12 rules for life</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:52.430" style="s2">you know I said look you what you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.750" end="01:18:55.160" style="s2">to understand is that you&#39;re a danger to</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.430" end="01:18:57.350" style="s2">your children no matter what right you</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.160" end="01:19:00.800" style="s2">can let them go out in the world and be</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.350" end="01:19:02.030" style="s2">hurt or you can over protect them and</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.800" end="01:19:04.160" style="s2">hurt them that way</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.030" end="01:19:06.770" style="s2">so you here&#39;s your choice you can make</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.160" end="01:19:09.800" style="s2">your children competent and courageous</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.770" end="01:19:11.450" style="s2">or you can make them safe but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.800" end="01:19:14.300" style="s2">make them safe because life isn&#39;t safe</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.450" end="01:19:16.040" style="s2">so if you sacrifice their courage and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.300" end="01:19:18.500" style="s2">competence on the altar of safety then</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.040" end="01:19:22.070" style="s2">you disarm them completely and all they</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.500" end="01:19:23.990" style="s2">can do is pray to be protected so in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.070" end="01:19:26.120" style="s2">very act we&#39;re trying to do the right</p>

<p begin="01:21:56.510" end="01:22:00.830" style="s2">fascinating let me pay you a compliment</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.970" end="01:22:04.370" style="s2">in some ways I think the most valuable</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.830" end="01:22:07.670" style="s2">thing you can do for us is to model the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.370" end="01:22:10.820" style="s2">courage to speak your mind you do it</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.670" end="01:22:13.250" style="s2">forcefully you do it courageously you do</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.820" end="01:22:15.440" style="s2">it compassionately because the reality</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.250" end="01:22:17.330" style="s2">is you only have to spend a bit of time</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.440" end="01:22:20.030" style="s2">with you to realize that you actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.330" end="01:22:22.130" style="s2">care especially about our young people</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.030" end="01:22:24.610" style="s2">and what they&#39;re experiencing and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.130" end="01:22:29.790" style="s2">especially for our young men because</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.610" end="01:22:34.060" style="s2">no boys model themselves are men who</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.790" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">they respect you&#39;re doing a great job of</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.060" end="01:22:37.750" style="s2">modeling courage in the face of farm</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:39.940" style="s2">well there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.750" end="01:22:42.010" style="s2">maybe in closing about courage people</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.940" end="01:22:44.469" style="s2">say that to me and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.010" end="01:22:46.060" style="s2">think it&#39;s exactly right doesn&#39;t there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.469" end="01:22:48.130" style="s2">a line in the Old Testament the fear of</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.060" end="01:22:49.510" style="s2">God is the beginning of wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.130" end="01:22:51.310" style="s2">think it&#39;s more like that it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.510" end="01:22:54.580" style="s2">I&#39;m courageous it&#39;s that I&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.310" end="01:22:56.110" style="s2">the right things so when I made my</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.580" end="01:22:56.889" style="s2">videos it wasn&#39;t like that didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.110" end="01:23:00.489" style="s2">me nervous</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.889" end="01:23:02.260" style="s2">but I was less nervous about going back</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.489" end="01:23:03.699" style="s2">to bed and not saying what I had to say</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.260" end="01:23:05.710" style="s2">that I was about making the videos</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.699" end="01:23:09.790" style="s2">because I know where this is going I</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.710" end="01:23:11.650" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go there and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.790" end="01:23:16.119" style="s2">not so much courage it&#39;s that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.650" end="01:23:20.230" style="s2">matter of I it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s less risky to</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.119" end="01:23:21.760" style="s2">say something than to remain silent when</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.230" end="01:23:24.730" style="s2">you know there&#39;s something to be said I</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.760" end="01:23:26.469" style="s2">know that to be the case and so lots of</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.730" end="01:23:28.510" style="s2">times in life it&#39;s like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.469" end="01:23:30.190" style="s2">pathway forward that&#39;s going to shield</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.510" end="01:23:32.440" style="s2">you from risk you get to pick this risk</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.190" end="01:23:34.750" style="s2">or you get to pick this risk and I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.440" end="01:23:36.369" style="s2">I picked the lesser risk and that might</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.750" end="01:23:39.489" style="s2">be wise but I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s</p>
