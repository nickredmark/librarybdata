<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:21.659" style="s2">between the two right which which one</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.169" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">are you now I am Jordan Hall Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.659" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">yeah Jordan Hall I was I was born Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:00:32.220" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">but everyone is now updated also for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:41.490" style="s2">viewers who are watching on YouTube you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">will notice that I am now in HD video</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.490" end="00:00:47.130" style="s2">guy Dean my video producer forced me to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">get a better webcam before it was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.130" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">potato sticking out the front of there</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:53.880" style="s2">one disadvantage is that now I I because</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:55.140" style="s2">it was so pixelated before I could get</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.880" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">away with not doing my hair I could get</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:00:58.950" style="s2">away with like you know put wearing</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:00.690" style="s2">essentially pajamas and no no pants or</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.950" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">whatever I wanted whereas now I have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.690" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">make it a little bit more of an effort</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:07.400" style="s2">which is good for the guests I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">and also that the viewers at home so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.400" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">Jordan what have you been working on</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.170" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">recently so I would like to compliment</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:16.909" style="s2">you on your HD I noticed that when I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">looking at it it&#39;s like wow that is very</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.909" end="00:01:26.180" style="s2">crisp that&#39;s some sharp imagery right</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">now yeah it is okay so let&#39;s see well if</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.180" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll assume a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">familiarity with what I&#39;ve been up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">because otherwise the story ends up</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:38.630" style="s2">being pretty long but the the basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">premise is for the past 20 years or so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.630" end="00:01:47.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:50.190" style="s2">we might say is sort of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.940" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">nature of the game that we&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.190" end="00:01:55.250" style="s2">ourselves playing for some significant</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:57.090" style="s2">period of time but I&#39;ll call game a and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.250" end="00:01:58.439" style="s2">initially really grabbing it from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.090" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">bunch of different threads and just</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.439" end="00:02:02.310" style="s2">noticing that if you just kept pulling</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">the thread say for example the thread of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">the 2008 financial crisis and then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">2010 echo in Europe if you take that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">thread you just keep following it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">just keep asking the question of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">under this what&#39;s deeper what&#39;s D</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">what&#39;s deeper there&#39;s a way to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">yourself at a very deep level that shows</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">that in fact as far as I can tell there</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">has been a particularly been playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">together since the birth of agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">civilization that were still essentially</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:38.730" style="s2">playing out that game as you&#39;d mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:40.500" style="s2">that there was a game before that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:41.880" style="s2">was pre the birth of agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.500" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">civilization and the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.880" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">transition between the two was a big</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">part of the early story and that from my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">perspective it became more and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.970" style="s2">clear of her time that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">game this game made this game of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.970" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">agricultural civilization its most</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">current form has a certain trajectory to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:03.299" style="s2">it it has a certain set of call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:07.019" style="s2">fundamental dynamics that lead to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.299" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">failing in certain ways and that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.019" end="00:03:11.850" style="s2">reboots reforms tries to keep searching</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">for ways to keep going on its own but</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.850" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of a meta terminus is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:18.660" style="s2">that there&#39;s a game to end all games the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:21.750" style="s2">game of Thrones actually comes to an end</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.660" end="00:03:24.890" style="s2">and we&#39;re sort of there we&#39;re at the end</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.750" end="00:03:27.239" style="s2">of game a you know maybe in the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.890" end="00:03:29.400" style="s2">year maybe in the next 20 years but</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.239" end="00:03:31.859" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely at a point where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.400" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">the methodology by which that game is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.859" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">able to reboot and try to re-establish</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">itself is coming to a to a terminus and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">so in that context what I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">most recently is what might mean we what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">might we do in that context how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:52.940" style="s2">find a way to really step outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.940" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">because if we&#39;re in the game at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:03:59.640" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of in the game all the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a very tricky thing so is their way</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.640" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">to step outside of that game completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">and to almost discover or maybe also in</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">some sense remember a new game that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">simultaneously something that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">that is not going to be a next release</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">all terminating and is really responsive</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">to this situation that we actually find</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:28.380" style="s2">ourselves in and is able to be born in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">the context of now</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.380" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">while still developed and develop on its</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:34.530" style="s2">own terms into being able to essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">take over from game a in the time that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.530" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">we have so what that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">what briefly characterizes game a the is</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:46.100" style="s2">that the question that takes 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">or 20 hours should I say if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.100" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">briefly which is probably about three</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:54.510" style="s2">hours we could do that briefly in about</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:55.950" style="s2">three hours my guess understood but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.510" end="00:04:56.520" style="s2">current status quo is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.950" end="00:04:58.350" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.520" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">and moving forward and trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.350" end="00:05:02.190" style="s2">something which doesn&#39;t have a terminus</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:04.290" style="s2">that ends up with us all being destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.190" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">sure let me let me try to see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.290" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">do it briefly it&#39;s always fun to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">things in real time and see what lands</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">Fisher has it forces forces you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">actually push your agency if anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:18.150" style="s2">comes out the way we&#39;re going so one way</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:20.550" style="s2">of thinking about it is trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:24.740" style="s2">out how to get human beings to live</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.550" end="00:05:29.220" style="s2">together relatively peaceably using</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.740" end="00:05:31.290" style="s2">formal institutional structures that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.220" end="00:05:32.790" style="s2">nice way to summarize it so any</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.290" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">variation on that theme which I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.790" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">just call society so I&#39;ll define society</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:42.770" style="s2">as human beings being in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:45.240" style="s2">with each other at least meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.770" end="00:05:48.570" style="s2">mediated by formal institutional</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.240" end="00:05:49.710" style="s2">structures yeah I think based on what</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:50.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve read of your work I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.710" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve managed to do it there you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.970" end="00:05:54.350" style="s2">that&#39;s three hours three hours condensed</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:05:56.640" style="s2">into 30 seconds congratulation</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.350" end="00:05:58.290" style="s2">graduations month and if that makes</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.640" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">sense to you then we&#39;re okay cool we</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.290" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">actually did compress something and are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:03.660" style="s2">now in a place that&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:04.920" style="s2">actually very powerful to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.660" end="00:06:08.250" style="s2">that if it didn&#39;t make sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.920" end="00:06:09.540" style="s2">the suggestion might be you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.250" end="00:06:11.790" style="s2">a lot behind it and we could continue to</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.540" end="00:06:13.920" style="s2">explore that and open it up I understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.790" end="00:06:17.160" style="s2">so you&#39;ve mentioned that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.920" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">threat of some kind sounds quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.160" end="00:06:23.400" style="s2">existential that&#39;s at the end of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:24.680" style="s2">particular iteration of society that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.400" end="00:06:29.720" style="s2">we&#39;re rolling through at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.680" end="00:06:29.720" style="s2">mm-hmm why is that inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.690" end="00:06:35.550" style="s2">okay this is fun again trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.750" end="00:06:38.940" style="s2">compress something that is fast this</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.550" end="00:06:40.590" style="s2">one&#39;s actually harder to do in a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.940" end="00:06:44.370" style="s2">that actually makes I think makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.590" end="00:06:53.600" style="s2">but let me let me begin let&#39;s see if I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.370" end="00:06:53.600" style="s2">can say this well so you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.360" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">gaming is fundamentally characterized as</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">a rival risk game it&#39;s able to perceive</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:14.820" style="s2">and relate to this other thing that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">called the anti rival wrist but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.820" end="00:07:17.970" style="s2">fundamentally a rival wrist game which</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">is to say that it&#39;s fundamentally win</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.970" end="00:07:22.200" style="s2">lose at the end it is very very bottom</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:24.810" style="s2">it addresses the question of when push</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.200" end="00:07:29.010" style="s2">comes to shove when you&#39;re pushing me</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.810" end="00:07:30.480" style="s2">which of us loses so it has all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.010" end="00:07:33.060" style="s2">different solutions to how do we avoid</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.480" end="00:07:34.860" style="s2">killing each other how do we try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.060" end="00:07:37.470" style="s2">actually cooperate so that things get</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.860" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">better but at it&#39;s very center like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.470" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">fundamental code of game a is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:47.790" style="s2">playing a rival wrist game and I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:49.500" style="s2">this is actually relatively selling it</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.790" end="00:07:50.880" style="s2">now like many people are feeling the oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.500" end="00:07:53.100" style="s2">wait a minute the other guys are</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.880" end="00:07:54.780" style="s2">fighting to win how do I make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.100" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">I I where there&#39;s no more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.780" end="00:07:59.000" style="s2">playing together how do we make sure the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:01.620" style="s2">other guys don&#39;t win and that and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.000" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">because it is so fundamentally that way</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.620" end="00:08:05.100" style="s2">what we notice is that through many</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:06.660" style="s2">different paths by the way there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.100" end="00:08:10.230" style="s2">least three that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.660" end="00:08:12.600" style="s2">identify our best efforts to weave</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.230" end="00:08:14.970" style="s2">something together that actually holds</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.600" end="00:08:19.140" style="s2">us together as a some larger community</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.970" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2">in peace unravel in the fullness of time</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.140" end="00:08:22.710" style="s2">which you know sometimes takes a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:26.430" style="s2">thousand years sometimes it takes fifty</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.710" end="00:08:27.780" style="s2">years just depends on circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.430" end="00:08:29.730" style="s2">one example and you mentioned this in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">the in the pre before we started filming</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.730" end="00:08:36.599" style="s2">is I think very salient like it people</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:38.910" style="s2">can grasp like feel this very well which</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.599" end="00:08:40.380" style="s2">is the the circumstance that we found</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.910" end="00:08:44.190" style="s2">ourself in right at the tail end of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.380" end="00:08:45.540" style="s2">World War two what</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.190" end="00:08:47.700" style="s2">the things that happens in rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.540" end="00:08:49.800" style="s2">game something is premise done reverse</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.700" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">games is that violence ends up being the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.800" end="00:08:54.270" style="s2">checksum at the end of the day when push</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:55.710" style="s2">comes to shove we&#39;re pushing and shoving</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.270" end="00:08:57.630" style="s2">meaning that we are in fact using</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.710" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">violence and the one who actually wins</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.630" end="00:09:05.730" style="s2">is the one who&#39;s better at fighting war</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">has been always the last move in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.730" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">game and so the last big war that we had</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.930" end="00:09:16.050" style="s2">World War 2 was really bad right lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.850" style="s2">bad things happened and lots of really</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.050" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">significant kinds of violence were</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:20.790" style="s2">unleashed in the world but what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:23.570" style="s2">noticed was the very last move in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.790" end="00:09:28.040" style="s2">game caused everybody to have to go whoa</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.570" end="00:09:31.430" style="s2">because when atomic energy was</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.040" end="00:09:33.180" style="s2">discovered and used and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.430" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">ever-so-slightly evolved we went from</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.180" end="00:09:36.870" style="s2">the a-bomb to the h-bomb and we went</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:39.570" style="s2">from the h-bomb in just american hands</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.870" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">to the h-bomb in at least two people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.570" end="00:09:44.010" style="s2">hands it was suddenly entered into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:47.520" style="s2">collective consciousness that we were in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.010" end="00:09:49.800" style="s2">a compareed different place that as bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.520" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">as world war ii was up until the moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.800" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">of multipolar nuclear power</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:10:00.390" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t fuck it up too badly we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:03.420" style="s2">couldn&#39;t kill everybody didn&#39;t try as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.390" end="00:10:04.710" style="s2">want with bullets and bombs humanity was</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.420" end="00:10:06.330" style="s2">going to continue to sort of move</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.710" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">forward we could reboot from World War</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.330" end="00:10:12.150" style="s2">two and say okay wow that suck let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:14.730" style="s2">a better thing and in fact did but by</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.150" end="00:10:16.080" style="s2">the mid 50s it was clear that we had now</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.730" end="00:10:20.190" style="s2">invented a way to kill everybody or at</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.080" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">least to so catastrophic Lee create</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.190" end="00:10:25.110" style="s2">violence as to make the notion of there</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.920" end="00:10:27.300" style="s2">being and next after that quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.110" end="00:10:29.490" style="s2">questionable I believe it was Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.300" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">who said I don&#39;t know how would War</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.490" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">three is going to be fought the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.620" style="s2">were for when we fought with sticks and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:36.780" style="s2">stones at the proposition that the depth</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.620" end="00:10:40.080" style="s2">of that reboot reboot is really deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.780" end="00:10:41.339" style="s2">yeah okay great well that was scary and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.080" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">for a long time people were like wow</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.339" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">this is you know all of our history has</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.700" style="s2">told us that we were going to get into</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:49.860" style="s2">fights so for a whole generation even</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.700" end="00:10:52.200" style="s2">two generations my generation the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.860" end="00:10:54.210" style="s2">was particular Holocaust is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.200" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">and tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.210" end="00:10:59.280" style="s2">you know we had nuclear bomb drill</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:00.930" style="s2">when I was in school in elementary</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.280" end="00:11:02.400" style="s2">school like he would actually get him to</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.930" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">your desk put a book over your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.400" end="00:11:07.530" style="s2">and pretend that would help you survive</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:08.940" style="s2">and you could rip off and that weighed</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.530" end="00:11:09.930" style="s2">heavily on the zeitgeist by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.940" end="00:11:11.580" style="s2">a lot of what&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.930" end="00:11:13.290" style="s2">connect should be traced back to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.580" end="00:11:14.070" style="s2">psychological consequences of growing up</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.290" end="00:11:16.130" style="s2">in that kind of an environment</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.070" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">particularly the boomers the hangover</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:22.020" style="s2">very long hangover from that the long</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">and deep hangover so okay that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.020" end="00:11:28.830" style="s2">but what we discovered when the wall</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:31.590" style="s2">came down was that in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.830" end="00:11:33.750" style="s2">nuclear war while catastrophic and</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.590" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">fragile it did actually the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.750" end="00:11:40.380" style="s2">day only require that two men two</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:44.520" style="s2">specific men in this case Reagan and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.380" end="00:11:46.950" style="s2">Gorbachev not push a button which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.520" end="00:11:48.620" style="s2">okay if either them push the button we</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.950" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">all die but as long as both of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.620" end="00:11:53.070" style="s2">simply manage not to push the button</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:55.350" style="s2">we&#39;re okay and we managed to pull that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.070" end="00:11:57.720" style="s2">off as such when you talk about it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.350" end="00:12:00.090" style="s2">that it makes the a well obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.720" end="00:12:02.730" style="s2">line is very very fine but you were</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.090" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">aware just how fine it is when it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.730" end="00:12:07.410" style="s2">your two buttons button presses away the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:09.030" style="s2">one button pipes press away we get on</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.410" end="00:12:10.260" style="s2">one side yeah you totally right but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.030" end="00:12:13.590" style="s2">either if either one pushes the button</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.260" end="00:12:13.890" style="s2">the game&#39;s over but we managed not to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.590" end="00:12:19.170" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.890" end="00:12:21.630" style="s2">so okay neat now we can trace that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.170" end="00:12:24.030" style="s2">notice that it&#39;s not just two now now</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.630" end="00:12:25.710" style="s2">nuclear proliferation is right at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.030" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">edge like we know for example that say</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.710" end="00:12:29.970" style="s2">Israel in South Africa our nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:34.940" style="s2">powers there&#39;s no question along with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.970" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">the UK in France Germany Pakistan India</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.940" end="00:12:38.940" style="s2">but when I spent time for example with</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:40.140" style="s2">people who were the experts in nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.940" end="00:12:42.540" style="s2">proliferation and they&#39;re sending a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.140" end="00:12:43.740" style="s2">message saying hey we&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.540" end="00:12:46.590" style="s2">able to hold back to the dam forever</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.740" end="00:12:47.940" style="s2">that we are going to be experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.590" end="00:12:50.730" style="s2">nuclear events over the next couple of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.940" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">decades because as our technical prowess</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.730" end="00:12:56.340" style="s2">continues to advance the distance</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.570" end="00:12:59.310" style="s2">between being nuclear and being</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.340" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">non-nuclear gets smaller and smaller and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.310" end="00:13:02.100" style="s2">particular at the fall the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:04.920" style="s2">the proliferation of both nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.100" end="00:13:07.770" style="s2">capacity and physical material out into</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.920" end="00:13:09.420" style="s2">places like use Becca Stan the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.770" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">to hold back that wall became less and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.420" end="00:13:12.569" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">so that&#39;s challenging but then what</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.569" end="00:13:16.739" style="s2">happens this is that you do you abstract</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.779" style="s2">you go up with at will and say okay the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.739" end="00:13:21.649" style="s2">challenge isn&#39;t really nuclear war the</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.819" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">example of that capacity but as our</p>

<p begin="00:13:49.249" end="00:13:55.439" style="s2">right so now for example as we as we</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.549" end="00:13:57.660" style="s2">begin to make smart grids as our</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.439" end="00:14:00.629" style="s2">electrical power system is dependent on</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.589" end="00:14:54.419" style="s2">generated at least for a while a feeling</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.419" end="00:14:59.759" style="s2">fragility and so on the one hand our</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.160" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">we keep finding really cool ways to kill</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:22.259" style="s2">be that only really the Soviet Union and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:24.750" style="s2">the United States had the capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.949" end="00:15:35.490" style="s2">one place to another just like nuclear</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.490" end="00:15:40.740" style="s2">the bar has been dropped tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.069" end="00:15:42.569" style="s2">and there&#39;s every reason to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.740" end="00:15:45.750" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna kind of follow a Moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.569" end="00:15:47.910" style="s2">of destructive potential where more and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.750" end="00:15:50.790" style="s2">more capacity will become more and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.910" end="00:15:52.980" style="s2">distributed so eventually your your</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.980" end="00:16:01.290" style="s2">blow up the world and no 10 adequately</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">motivated smart high school kids yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.290" end="00:16:05.610" style="s2">maybe like that&#39;s a and in it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.750" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">like you think really an Ikea like 10</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.610" end="00:16:08.459" style="s2">adequate and motivated smart high school</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:09.930" style="s2">kids right now could meaningfully</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.459" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">disrupt the entire global financial</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.930" end="00:16:12.779" style="s2">industry right now no plot no question</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">right for sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.779" end="00:16:17.009" style="s2">and in some sense already have like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">hacking of Sony for example yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.009" end="00:16:21.959" style="s2">hacking of Experian we&#39;re probably in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:22.860" style="s2">that range like they probably were not</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.959" end="00:16:23.790" style="s2">CIA</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.860" end="00:16:25.579" style="s2">they may have been but they probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:30.149" style="s2">weren&#39;t they probably were just</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.579" end="00:16:31.769" style="s2">meaningfully intelligent and not yea and</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.149" end="00:16:33.209" style="s2">bored exactly and maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.769" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">like angst-ridden like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.209" end="00:16:37.250" style="s2">angst-ridden teenagers can kill us all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:39.569" style="s2">should send a chill than everyone&#39;s spot</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.250" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">and then what happens is right so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.569" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">with the last piece now connect the dots</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:48.110" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got a game which at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">the day is fundamentally rival risk and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.110" end="00:16:52.050" style="s2">in many ways every time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.870" style="s2">experienced a long piece like the ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.050" end="00:16:59.089" style="s2">from world war ii nür now it&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.870" end="00:17:01.529" style="s2">been because caddis like decisive</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.089" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">strategic advantage in military the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.529" end="00:17:07.770" style="s2">capacity to deploy violence has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">held by one or maybe two players as for</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.770" end="00:17:13.819" style="s2">the stability of bipolar superpower &#39;dom</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.159" style="s2">the Soviet Union the United States</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.819" end="00:17:19.199" style="s2">played a big role that because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.159" end="00:17:20.459" style="s2">else was vastly inferior to the United</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.199" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">States and the Soviet Union&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.459" end="00:17:24.659" style="s2">deploy violence it really did mean that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">kind of two grown-ups could kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.659" end="00:17:29.250" style="s2">things relatively peaceful on a global</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:34.370" style="s2">basis or we had the thinking of the long</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.250" end="00:17:36.299" style="s2">piece of the British Empire and etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.370" end="00:17:37.340" style="s2">but when we find ourselves in a</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.640" end="00:17:55.940" style="s2">you end up in a situation where the game</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.940" end="00:18:01.220" style="s2">around escalating capacity to deploy or</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:07.670" style="s2">straightforward right I mean if this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.960" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">the missile gap the missile gap story</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.670" end="00:18:12.560" style="s2">continues to be true it&#39;s easy to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:13.970" style="s2">well we need to spend a trillion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.560" end="00:18:14.990" style="s2">in American defense because the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.970" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">are spending a trillion dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.990" end="00:18:18.230" style="s2">defense and they&#39;re gonna obsolete our</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.310" end="00:18:20.300" style="s2">aircraft carriers in two years so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.230" end="00:18:21.560" style="s2">have to have a response so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.300" end="00:18:22.610" style="s2">innovate a new way but of course they</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.560" end="00:18:24.590" style="s2">then look at that and say well they have</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:26.090" style="s2">to in a bit a new way and so we fight we</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.590" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">force each other to go into an</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.090" end="00:18:30.770" style="s2">innovation conflict which means that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:32.120" style="s2">must continue to push the curve on the</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.680" end="00:18:39.080" style="s2">it&#39;s dick-measuring on the grandest and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.350" end="00:18:41.560" style="s2">most destructive scale possible right</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:43.610" style="s2">and with if you include the loopback of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.560" end="00:18:47.570" style="s2">actually being able to what are those</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.610" end="00:18:48.230" style="s2">things called you know penis enlargement</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.570" end="00:18:52.120" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">if penis enlargement really worked</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.120" end="00:18:57.470" style="s2">imagine what the consequences would</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:19:00.410" style="s2">actually be this is exactly the problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.470" end="00:19:02.830" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly that there&#39;s no I honestly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.410" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">think that if penis enlargement was more</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.830" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">decentralized that we may have greater</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:10.550" style="s2">problems than someone pushing the button</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:13.100" style="s2">it would be well it would just be</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.550" end="00:19:14.390" style="s2">catastrophe everywhere it would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.100" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">fine if we could actually explore many</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.390" end="00:19:17.720" style="s2">of the things that are happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:19.400" style="s2">cultural level is actually that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.720" end="00:19:21.830" style="s2">posturing and dick-measuring isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:23.630" style="s2">yeah you told me right I John I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.830" end="00:19:25.610" style="s2">you&#39;ve managed to in the space of just</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.630" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">under 20 minutes there you&#39;ve managed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.610" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">give a great synopsis so we are at</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:31.970" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s actually deeper principles</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:33.110" style="s2">there&#39;s more fundamental stuff but this</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.970" end="00:19:34.550" style="s2">is a good like the gives you a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.110" end="00:19:36.470" style="s2">you&#39;re at least they&#39;re like you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.550" end="00:19:38.450" style="s2">handle you&#39;re holding one like piece of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.470" end="00:19:39.530" style="s2">the story that&#39;s like okay that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.450" end="00:19:41.630" style="s2">for sure there there&#39;s like two or three</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.530" end="00:19:43.430" style="s2">deeper principles but we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.630" end="00:19:44.840" style="s2">go there this scenes been set so where</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:46.310" style="s2">do we go from here or why do we go from</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:49.550" style="s2">there from that that point of the story</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.310" end="00:19:51.040" style="s2">moving forward what and and also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.550" end="00:19:57.460" style="s2">sure you&#39;ll get into it</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.040" end="00:19:59.050" style="s2">be right well that&#39;s where we go so like</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:03.580" style="s2">the first step is to recognize you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.050" end="00:20:06.070" style="s2">a problem you know hi my name is Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.580" end="00:20:07.570" style="s2">I play game a we need to get there we</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.070" end="00:20:10.420" style="s2">need to get there rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.570" end="00:20:13.540" style="s2">collectively and let&#39;s take for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.420" end="00:20:14.950" style="s2">what happened in 2016 in America in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.540" end="00:20:18.970" style="s2">States you guys had it a few about a</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.950" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">year earlier right we keep being handed</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.970" end="00:20:23.800" style="s2">wonderful opportunities to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:25.360" style="s2">that we have a problem and we keep</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.800" end="00:20:28.810" style="s2">finding increasingly sophisticated ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.360" end="00:20:30.340" style="s2">to deny that we have a problem we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.810" end="00:20:34.380" style="s2">to notice we have a problem and we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.340" end="00:20:38.590" style="s2">to take the time to really perceive that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.380" end="00:20:41.260" style="s2">and really take it as our problem like</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.590" end="00:20:43.270" style="s2">not their problem not some pick your</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.260" end="00:20:44.050" style="s2">poison and yeah you know point point the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.270" end="00:20:45.400" style="s2">things you&#39;re in and create the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.050" end="00:20:46.990" style="s2">appropriate disparagement that fits your</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.400" end="00:20:50.020" style="s2">particular perspective on these things</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.990" end="00:20:51.460" style="s2">yep nope no it&#39;s in fact my problem I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.020" end="00:20:53.290" style="s2">going to take full responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.460" end="00:20:54.430" style="s2">where we are which means by the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.290" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">understanding what it means to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.430" end="00:20:59.290" style="s2">responsibility I can&#39;t be an activist</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:01.270" style="s2">because activism is false responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.290" end="00:21:02.830" style="s2">it&#39;s expecting that you can do stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.270" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">can&#39;t actually do what can you take</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.830" end="00:21:05.860" style="s2">responsibility for well the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:10.450" style="s2">you can take responsibility for is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.860" end="00:21:13.000" style="s2">participating at all in the kind of mind</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.450" end="00:21:17.980" style="s2">what I call a sense maker the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.000" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2">sense maker that is game a at the game a</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:22.750" style="s2">sense maker is a kind it&#39;s not the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:25.750" style="s2">one that exists in potential there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.750" end="00:21:28.500" style="s2">other examples but it&#39;s the generator</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.750" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">function if you always find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.500" end="00:21:34.450" style="s2">trying to figure out how to solve</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.460" end="00:21:36.460" style="s2">problems from the game a toolkit using</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.450" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">the game a sense maker then all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:42.550" style="s2">doing is playing game a now that turns</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:44.590" style="s2">out to be daunting and for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.550" end="00:21:49.660" style="s2">people the game the sort of the story</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.590" end="00:21:52.120" style="s2">stops there although to be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.660" end="00:21:54.370" style="s2">frank for the vast majority of people it</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.120" end="00:21:56.620" style="s2">actually wouldn&#39;t be that hard to shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.370" end="00:21:59.260" style="s2">but because of the way the human beings</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.620" end="00:22:02.520" style="s2">will relate to each other it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.260" end="00:22:02.520" style="s2">being how do I said is right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.630" end="00:22:10.190" style="s2">most people look to other people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">figure out what the right way to respond</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.190" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">to the world is we&#39;re a mimetic creature</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:21.110" style="s2">right we&#39;re mimetic creature right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:22.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort the kind of people who for</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.110" end="00:22:24.770" style="s2">whatever remember that remember see that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.700" end="00:22:27.680" style="s2">big great photograph of like a Nuremberg</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.770" end="00:22:29.870" style="s2">style rally and there&#39;s like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.680" end="00:22:31.660" style="s2">thousand Nazis like saluting and one</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.870" end="00:22:34.370" style="s2">dude standing there folding his arms</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.660" end="00:22:36.320" style="s2">even see it oh it&#39;s great you should get</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.370" end="00:22:41.510" style="s2">it and like you put it up yep because</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.320" end="00:22:44.540" style="s2">the question the point is if you had ten</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.510" end="00:22:47.870" style="s2">people fold in their arms the whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.540" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">rally falls apart because the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.870" end="00:22:51.680" style="s2">day people are like signal like feeling</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:53.000" style="s2">out into their environment okay what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.680" end="00:22:54.530" style="s2">the right way to respond to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.000" end="00:22:55.940" style="s2">happening and if they&#39;re just getting</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.530" end="00:22:57.290" style="s2">signals that are also pointing in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.940" end="00:22:59.630" style="s2">same direction that okay I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.290" end="00:23:01.070" style="s2">what it is but there are some people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.630" end="00:23:02.510" style="s2">for whatever reason because of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.070" end="00:23:05.390" style="s2">life experience because of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.510" end="00:23:10.690" style="s2">genotype because of secure circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.390" end="00:23:13.640" style="s2">are in a position to not respond in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.690" end="00:23:17.060" style="s2">self-reinforcing feedback loop of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.640" end="00:23:19.460" style="s2">social milieu if there&#39;s enough of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.060" end="00:23:21.710" style="s2">that are signaling something different</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.460" end="00:23:23.180" style="s2">and they&#39;re signalling that something</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.710" end="00:23:24.410" style="s2">different with some coherence meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.180" end="00:23:27.050" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of showing up is the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.410" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">kind of signal then you begin to get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.050" end="00:23:31.460" style="s2">shift and it gives everybody else an</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:36.650" style="s2">orientation towards what right action</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:38.270" style="s2">might feel like it might look like so</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.650" end="00:23:40.850" style="s2">that&#39;s how you begin to make the move</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.270" end="00:23:44.120" style="s2">from game a 2-game P is that first step</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.850" end="00:23:47.390" style="s2">sorry to interject that it sounds an</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.120" end="00:23:49.940" style="s2">awful lot like the manifestation of game</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.390" end="00:23:51.500" style="s2">a is just an extrapolation of the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.940" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">that we naturally are were tribal</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.500" end="00:23:56.350" style="s2">creatures with this rival risk game</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.020" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">would have been played out</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.350" end="00:24:00.740" style="s2">surely in nomadic tribes a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:02.660" style="s2">you&#39;re in this valley you see someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.740" end="00:24:04.760" style="s2">from another valley therefore there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.660" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">some conflict between the two of you it</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.760" end="00:24:12.260" style="s2">is an extrapolation of that activated by</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:15.890" style="s2">the invention of formalized structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.260" end="00:24:16.940" style="s2">right so there was a long time where we</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.890" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">interacted with each other what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.940" end="00:24:21.050" style="s2">might call the trap</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:23.450" style="s2">that is actually not game a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.050" end="00:24:25.040" style="s2">something pre yeah and there may be many</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.450" end="00:24:28.130" style="s2">many flavors without is hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.040" end="00:24:30.650" style="s2">know you know deep anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.130" end="00:24:34.520" style="s2">probably have insight into that but once</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.650" end="00:24:37.160" style="s2">you add actuation by formal structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.520" end="00:24:42.500" style="s2">the invention of society the invention</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.160" end="00:24:46.130" style="s2">of weight like law and money and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.500" end="00:24:48.890" style="s2">ability to use learning to invent social</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.130" end="00:24:50.870" style="s2">abstractions that can actuate human</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.890" end="00:24:53.180" style="s2">collective intelligence this group is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.870" end="00:24:55.610" style="s2">groups of human who can coordinate in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.180" end="00:24:57.800" style="s2">ways that make them more effective in</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.610" end="00:25:01.940" style="s2">the world then you&#39;re playing gaming I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.800" end="00:25:04.040" style="s2">understand my my concern wanting to move</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">towards something which is a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.040" end="00:25:11.240" style="s2">long-term strategy was that game a was</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:13.730" style="s2">simply our genetic code our tribal</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:16.010" style="s2">nature but manifesting itself and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.730" end="00:25:18.680" style="s2">moving from that to anything which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.010" end="00:25:20.540" style="s2">that would be such a monumental task</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.680" end="00:25:23.210" style="s2">that it would require us to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.540" end="00:25:24.970" style="s2">new evolution yep yep fortunately this</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.210" end="00:25:27.980" style="s2">evolution actually happened about</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.970" end="00:25:29.990" style="s2">150,000 to 1.5 million years ago okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:31.190" style="s2">this is really good news because if that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.990" end="00:25:32.510" style="s2">hadn&#39;t happened I agree with you that</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.190" end="00:25:35.540" style="s2">the likelihood that we&#39;d be able to sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.510" end="00:25:38.060" style="s2">of undergo an evolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.540" end="00:25:41.210" style="s2">magnitude in real time with the shit</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.060" end="00:25:44.020" style="s2">hitting the fan is essentially zero so</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.210" end="00:25:44.020" style="s2">this is what I mean when I say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:51.890" style="s2">human beings are not the same as other</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.180" end="00:25:53.630" style="s2">primates meaning like significantly</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.890" end="00:25:55.190" style="s2">something happened and we&#39;re obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.630" end="00:25:56.660" style="s2">witnessing the consequences to that but</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.190" end="00:25:59.060" style="s2">we can actually identify it now and dial</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.660" end="00:26:00.770" style="s2">it back in so the story kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.060" end="00:26:05.180" style="s2">like this I&#39;ll try to keep it compact</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.770" end="00:26:07.370" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have infinite time if</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.180" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">you take a look at other primates closed</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.370" end="00:26:13.610" style="s2">primaries they say orangutangs</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:15.980" style="s2">gorillas chimpanzees etc what you notice</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.610" end="00:26:18.620" style="s2">in humans and in fact in this case all</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.980" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">social mammals you notice that they all</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.620" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">have access to a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.290" style="s2">hierarchical structure particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:26.390" style="s2">among males we can call a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.290" end="00:26:27.410" style="s2">hierarchy mmm this place it&#39;s gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.390" end="00:26:31.080" style="s2">lot of traction over the past year</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.410" end="00:26:33.179" style="s2">because of the other Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.080" end="00:26:37.379" style="s2">so that&#39;s commonplace and we have that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.179" end="00:26:38.999" style="s2">so you might say our natural need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.379" end="00:26:41.190" style="s2">compete with each other for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.999" end="00:26:43.739" style="s2">kind of scarcity and to organize</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.190" end="00:26:47.330" style="s2">ourselves into effective competing bands</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.739" end="00:26:50.279" style="s2">is real that&#39;s a real part of our nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.330" end="00:26:51.779" style="s2">we human beings also have and is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.279" end="00:26:54.619" style="s2">thing that actually makes us human and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.779" end="00:26:58.409" style="s2">not other kinds of primates a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.619" end="00:27:00.600" style="s2">way of doing things it&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.409" end="00:27:02.369" style="s2">prestige hierarchy which is odd because</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.600" end="00:27:04.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not really a hierarchy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.369" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">called a prestige dynamic so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.289" end="00:27:08.070" style="s2">the dominance dynamic which is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:10.850" style="s2">hierarchy and the prestige dynamic other</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.070" end="00:27:14.070" style="s2">primates don&#39;t have the prestige dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.850" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">this is a incomprehensibly fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.070" end="00:27:20.249" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s worth sort of actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:21.749" style="s2">slowing down chimpanzees do not do a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.249" end="00:27:24.419" style="s2">very good job of learning from each</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.749" end="00:27:26.759" style="s2">other if a particular champion Z has</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.419" end="00:27:29.249" style="s2">discovered something neato it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.759" end="00:27:32.070" style="s2">spread through the through the band or</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.249" end="00:27:34.350" style="s2">the troupe this is because dominance</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.070" end="00:27:39.840" style="s2">hierarchies are premise taun mostly</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.350" end="00:27:41.460" style="s2">physical violence so a dominant male is</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:42.899" style="s2">able to beat the crap out of other males</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.460" end="00:27:45.210" style="s2">and their force established himself as</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.899" end="00:27:47.549" style="s2">dominant and he may have a small number</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.210" end="00:27:49.919" style="s2">of beta buddies who kind of like get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.549" end="00:27:51.779" style="s2">table scraps since to support him but</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.919" end="00:27:53.609" style="s2">the big thing there is the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.779" end="00:27:56.279" style="s2">males relate to each other is largely a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.609" end="00:27:57.659" style="s2">version meaning you don&#39;t make eye</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.279" end="00:27:59.159" style="s2">contact with the dominant male because</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.659" end="00:28:01.499" style="s2">that means it&#39;s a threat he&#39;s gonna kick</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.159" end="00:28:03.210" style="s2">your ass what&#39;s really fuckin hard to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.499" end="00:28:06.659" style="s2">learn things from other people if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.210" end="00:28:08.059" style="s2">don&#39;t make eye contact with them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.659" end="00:28:10.889" style="s2">right yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.059" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">human beings found themselves at over</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.889" end="00:28:15.739" style="s2">what appears to have been a pretty darn</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:18.779" style="s2">long exploration in evolutionary space</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.739" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">finding a way to take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.779" end="00:28:24.239" style="s2">capacity of learning so to interject</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:26.340" style="s2">that some of the listeners familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.239" end="00:28:30.210" style="s2">previous episodes will know William von</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.340" end="00:28:33.179" style="s2">Hippel who wrote the social leap it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.210" end="00:28:37.109" style="s2">an explanation of how we went from</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.179" end="00:28:39.029" style="s2">Australopithecus out onto the plains the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.109" end="00:28:41.359" style="s2">development of the throwing arm and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.029" end="00:28:43.740" style="s2">of this were from one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.359" end="00:28:44.909" style="s2">discoveries or one of the big claims</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.740" end="00:28:47.070" style="s2">that he made was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.909" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">the anticipation of felt needs and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.070" end="00:28:52.549" style="s2">unwanted needs was a real a real key</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:55.559" style="s2">element here so the fact that chimpanzee</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.549" end="00:28:58.049" style="s2">creates a tool let&#39;s say simple tool for</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.559" end="00:28:59.580" style="s2">poking at something creating some food</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.049" end="00:29:02.220" style="s2">whatever it might be at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.580" end="00:29:03.950" style="s2">day it can&#39;t anticipate the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.220" end="00:29:07.470" style="s2">needs it again so it just throws it away</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.950" end="00:29:09.419" style="s2">mmm and then the next day it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.470" end="00:29:13.259" style="s2">it&#39;s got to make the tool again yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.419" end="00:29:15.869" style="s2">however what the one of the the main</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.259" end="00:29:18.269" style="s2">archeological finds which identified</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.869" end="00:29:21.889" style="s2">this movement towards being able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.269" end="00:29:26.039" style="s2">anticipate unfelt needs was that</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.889" end="00:29:30.059" style="s2">multiple tools were being found in sites</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.039" end="00:29:31.649" style="s2">where human ancestors had been so what</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.059" end="00:29:33.149" style="s2">that meant was that not only had they</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.649" end="00:29:34.590" style="s2">made them once and then thrown them away</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.149" end="00:29:37.529" style="s2">they&#39;d made them and then taken them</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.590" end="00:29:39.090" style="s2">with them the next day so yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.529" end="00:29:41.059" style="s2">anticipation and also you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.090" end="00:29:43.139" style="s2">communication can&#39;t communicate and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.059" end="00:29:44.429" style="s2">especially if you can&#39;t make eye contact</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.139" end="00:29:46.200" style="s2">but even if you you know you&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.429" end="00:29:47.549" style="s2">sophisticated language at all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.200" end="00:29:49.379" style="s2">totally right how does the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.549" end="00:29:54.029" style="s2">collective consciousness grow it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.379" end="00:29:58.409" style="s2">it does it so there&#39;s a very large</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.029" end="00:30:01.470" style="s2">number like 17 maybe more distinct</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.409" end="00:30:02.940" style="s2">innovations that kind of have you ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.470" end="00:30:04.649" style="s2">seen this like a Japanese puzzle that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.940" end="00:30:06.659" style="s2">has a bunch of different pieces where</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.649" end="00:30:12.119" style="s2">you have to be able to actually be able</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.659" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">to twist pull and and slide all at once</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.119" end="00:30:16.379" style="s2">in a very smooth relationship to get it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:20.519" style="s2">to move is this like just the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.379" end="00:30:23.190" style="s2">hottest rubik&#39;s cube kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.519" end="00:30:25.619" style="s2">interesting is that if you pull it binds</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.190" end="00:30:27.299" style="s2">on the twists if you if you slide it</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.619" end="00:30:29.759" style="s2">binds on the pull right so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.299" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">actually get all this so evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.759" end="00:30:33.029" style="s2">Homo sapiens sapiens was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:35.820" style="s2">that like you had to get you had to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.029" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s which is a neat thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.820" end="00:30:40.919" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s that the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">females live long enough that a mother</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.919" end="00:30:46.379" style="s2">has a daughter and is still alive long</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:49.169" style="s2">enough to actually co-parent her</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.379" end="00:30:51.989" style="s2">daughter&#39;s children is a big deal yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.169" end="00:30:56.359" style="s2">you had to get fatherhood like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.989" end="00:30:57.490" style="s2">notion that males could have a lived</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.359" end="00:31:00.429" style="s2">select</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.490" end="00:31:03.280" style="s2">a Fitness adaptation by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.429" end="00:31:04.900" style="s2">putting their energy into attending to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.280" end="00:31:07.270" style="s2">the well-being of their actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.900" end="00:31:11.309" style="s2">biological children isn&#39;t neat is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.270" end="00:31:15.580" style="s2">innovation you had to have a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.309" end="00:31:17.290" style="s2">have anticipated needs you had to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.580" end="00:31:19.570" style="s2">capacity to enter into a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.290" end="00:31:21.880" style="s2">long enough the communication had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.570" end="00:31:23.620" style="s2">place to emerge and then you had to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.880" end="00:31:25.480" style="s2">the development of the physiological and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.620" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">neurological capacity to explore the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.480" end="00:31:30.490" style="s2">space of potential communication all</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:31.929" style="s2">right so all of these pieces you have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.490" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">have all of them and they kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.929" end="00:31:35.650" style="s2">slide against each other until it snaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:37.809" style="s2">into this new thing that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.650" end="00:31:41.050" style="s2">legalistically in sapiens totally get it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.809" end="00:31:43.059" style="s2">that&#39;s a really lovely analogy to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.050" end="00:31:45.630" style="s2">with the puzzle I think that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.059" end="00:31:47.830" style="s2">makes complete sense it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.630" end="00:31:49.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pause for one second there</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.830" end="00:31:51.010" style="s2">make the only thing is it keeps on I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.480" end="00:31:53.230" style="s2">think it might be my internet connection</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.010" end="00:32:01.630" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna flick to another network I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.230" end="00:32:04.360" style="s2">cut this let me see if this holds on are</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.630" end="00:32:05.530" style="s2">we back we&#39;re back we&#39;re back sweet so</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.360" end="00:32:07.540" style="s2">we&#39;ll just go from here again man</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.530" end="00:32:08.650" style="s2">right and I&#39;ll let you know I have I</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.540" end="00:32:10.450" style="s2">have 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.650" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">that&#39;s fine and then and then a maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.450" end="00:32:13.780" style="s2">little bit of time depending on when the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.640" style="s2">next folks show up totally fine let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.780" end="00:32:17.860" style="s2">really I&#39;m here so so what we find</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.640" end="00:32:19.750" style="s2">ourselves is that this new thing which</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.860" end="00:32:23.559" style="s2">is in fact the difference between Homo</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.750" end="00:32:26.440" style="s2">sapiens and all other primates is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.559" end="00:32:28.960" style="s2">new kind of relationship that we cut</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.440" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">that they call the prestige relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.960" end="00:32:33.790" style="s2">and in the prestige relationship what</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:36.610" style="s2">happens is we discover the power of</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.790" end="00:32:37.780" style="s2">learning and learning from each other so</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.610" end="00:32:39.880" style="s2">learning is learning from each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.780" end="00:32:40.780" style="s2">there&#39;s one kind where I go out in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.880" end="00:32:42.130" style="s2">world now I experience the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.780" end="00:32:45.160" style="s2">directly and I kind of figure stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.130" end="00:32:47.500" style="s2">but when I am able to do what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.160" end="00:32:50.890" style="s2">doing right now I can take my entire</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.500" end="00:32:53.559" style="s2">lifetime of work which is not easy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.890" end="00:32:57.490" style="s2">convey to you a pretty sizable chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.559" end="00:33:00.520" style="s2">it in an hour that&#39;s learning right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.490" end="00:33:01.929" style="s2">is a significant shift in fact and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.520" end="00:33:03.100" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happened since then is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.929" end="00:33:05.500" style="s2">a consequence of that shit like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.100" end="00:33:08.760" style="s2">dynamic of that capacity the ability to</p>

<p begin="00:33:42.300" end="00:33:46.950" style="s2">variety of different ways so that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:33:46.950" end="00:33:51.630" style="s2">happened we over the past 150 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.430" end="00:33:53.610" style="s2">years have just been playing out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:56.370" style="s2">consequences of those two dynamics in</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.610" end="00:33:58.710" style="s2">relationship with each other right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.370" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">the dominance hierarchy has been around</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.710" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">for a real long time so in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.130" end="00:34:07.170" style="s2">humans would use learning to allow them</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">to achieve rival risk dominance with</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.170" end="00:34:10.379" style="s2">other animals and plants in their local</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:11.580" style="s2">environment and of course we very</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.379" end="00:34:13.320" style="s2">quickly discovered that with a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.580" end="00:34:15.120" style="s2">bit of learning vickicooper at the peak</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.320" end="00:34:17.310" style="s2">predator anywhere so they could move</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.120" end="00:34:19.379" style="s2">from the African savanna out into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.310" end="00:34:20.580" style="s2">deserts into Islands up into the Arctic</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.379" end="00:34:22.889" style="s2">and in the space of two or three</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.580" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">generations use learning using this this</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.889" end="00:34:26.909" style="s2">capacity we just described to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">out-compete all other animals in a rival</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.909" end="00:34:32.100" style="s2">wrist way right and become the peak</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:34.460" style="s2">predator well then what happened was we</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.100" end="00:34:36.690" style="s2">expanded across the entire globe and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.460" end="00:34:37.980" style="s2">expanded in our population enough that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.690" end="00:34:40.200" style="s2">suddenly the thing that we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.980" end="00:34:43.290" style="s2">running into is not animals but other</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.200" end="00:34:45.210" style="s2">people well now we enter into the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.290" end="00:34:47.310" style="s2">phase of the game we&#39;re still more or</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.210" end="00:34:48.840" style="s2">less playing out the game of dominance</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.310" end="00:34:51.720" style="s2">still more or less playing out the game</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.840" end="00:34:54.330" style="s2">so deeply hardwired into our mmmm a lien</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.720" end="00:34:57.060" style="s2">structure that is sort of still the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.330" end="00:34:58.980" style="s2">primary tone but we&#39;re continuing Lee</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.060" end="00:35:01.080" style="s2">having to get better and better at</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.980" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">playing the prestige game in order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.080" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">win the dominance game as we saw right</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.510" end="00:35:07.410" style="s2">the the explosion of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.240" style="s2">explosion the Sumerians and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.410" end="00:35:13.070" style="s2">Egyptians and just their expansion</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.240" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">against the tribal model is the use of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.070" end="00:35:18.930" style="s2">prestige under constraints that enslave</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:21.210" style="s2">it fundamentally to dominance to allow</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.930" end="00:35:23.040" style="s2">dominance to out-compete dominance was</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.210" end="00:35:24.360" style="s2">in his game a now</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.040" end="00:35:27.740" style="s2">just described gave me an even more</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.360" end="00:35:30.180" style="s2">fundamental way and somewhere around</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.740" end="00:35:32.250" style="s2">maybe World War two I kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.180" end="00:35:33.420" style="s2">think of like the moment the the aha</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.250" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">moment that must have happened with</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.420" end="00:35:39.470" style="s2">every single military leader during</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:42.300" style="s2">World War two when they discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.470" end="00:35:46.110" style="s2">sophisticated soldiers with you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.300" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">healthy vigorous and good tactics ended</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.110" end="00:35:49.590" style="s2">up constantly getting out competed by</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:52.290" style="s2">sort of a pencil neck geeks sitting F</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.590" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2">bat back in Bletchley Park like whoa</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.290" end="00:35:55.170" style="s2">shit</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.160" end="00:35:56.940" style="s2">the smartypants are now actually the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.170" end="00:35:58.500" style="s2">decisive factor you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.940" end="00:36:00.270" style="s2">matter how many men I throw into the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.500" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">field and how well-trained they are one</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.270" end="00:36:04.410" style="s2">nuke takes them out there&#39;s the one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:05.550" style="s2">you have a man with a button well as</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.410" end="00:36:08.670" style="s2">long as you have a man who knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.550" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">make a better button then my buttons</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.670" end="00:36:11.400" style="s2">bigger than your button so then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.140" style="s2">entered into the game and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.400" end="00:36:16.740" style="s2">thing I think their Weinstein has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.140" end="00:36:18.270" style="s2">exploring I think not exploring aware of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.740" end="00:36:20.340" style="s2">this part of the story but exploring it</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.270" end="00:36:23.190" style="s2">really deeply is you know the game from</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">1950 until now has been we&#39;ll shoot how</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.190" end="00:36:28.200" style="s2">do I make sure that I keep how do I be</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">be in charge of the button while getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.200" end="00:36:33.570" style="s2">other people to build me a better button</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:34.920" style="s2">okay that&#39;s kind of where we are right</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.570" end="00:36:36.690" style="s2">there yep we&#39;ve got a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.920" end="00:36:38.220" style="s2">folks who are still really fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.690" end="00:36:40.860" style="s2">playing some variation of the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.220" end="00:36:42.840" style="s2">game trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.860" end="00:36:46.380" style="s2">continue to stay in charge to stay</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.840" end="00:36:47.580" style="s2">dominant over prestige so we might say</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.380" end="00:36:49.350" style="s2">that the shift that we&#39;re really talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.580" end="00:36:51.090" style="s2">about is actually very simple we just</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.350" end="00:36:53.970" style="s2">need to finish the story that happened a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.090" end="00:36:55.770" style="s2">million and a half years ago of fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.970" end="00:36:59.420" style="s2">the shift from dominance to prestige</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.770" end="00:37:03.330" style="s2">from Game a to game B to a game that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.420" end="00:37:07.140" style="s2">crema stone the learning of learning</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.330" end="00:37:09.180" style="s2">premise ston both the advantages that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.140" end="00:37:12.320" style="s2">happens when we&#39;re able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.180" end="00:37:16.290" style="s2">communicate truth to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.320" end="00:37:19.350" style="s2">learn from each other and the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.290" end="00:37:22.500" style="s2">relationships that we need to be in for</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.350" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">that to flourish what are the steps that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.500" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">you think need to be taken to go from</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:29.310" style="s2">game a to game be I&#39;m aware that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.580" end="00:37:31.380" style="s2">grand question but today has been a day</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.310" end="00:37:33.330" style="s2">of trying to get you to condense down</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.380" end="00:37:35.690" style="s2">some very complicated topics into some</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.330" end="00:37:38.869" style="s2">into some short short sentences of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.690" end="00:37:41.480" style="s2">sure I I think it&#39;s actually relatively</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.869" end="00:37:45.470" style="s2">straightforward I think that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.480" end="00:37:47.270" style="s2">there are 1 2 3 there are 4 steps it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.470" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">a 4 step program we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.270" end="00:37:52.789" style="s2">actually eliminate 8 we&#39;re getting more</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:56.359" style="s2">efficient amazing so the first step is</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.789" end="00:38:00.470" style="s2">to recognize and acknowledge that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.359" end="00:38:02.990" style="s2">have a problem and to really let that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.470" end="00:38:05.470" style="s2">sink all the way down into your toes I</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.990" end="00:38:09.220" style="s2">would call this entering into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.470" end="00:38:13.460" style="s2">extraordinarily deep level of humility</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.220" end="00:38:15.559" style="s2">and let that just dissolve and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.460" end="00:38:19.099" style="s2">it&#39;s this is a bunch of good phrase it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.559" end="00:38:20.599" style="s2">like sadly I don&#39;t have the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.099" end="00:38:22.599" style="s2">language for this particular stage but</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.599" end="00:38:26.180" style="s2">it is that extraordinary humility</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.599" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">surrender is another big one I allow</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.180" end="00:38:31.670" style="s2">yourself to sink into a liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:33.349" style="s2">into not knowing and know that the only</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.670" end="00:38:36.740" style="s2">thing you can really know is you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.349" end="00:38:38.299" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t know and allow that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.740" end="00:38:39.619" style="s2">paradox that cowan which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.299" end="00:38:41.630" style="s2">just a really nice description of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.619" end="00:38:44.170" style="s2">reality to sink in and dissolve and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.630" end="00:38:46.549" style="s2">settle step 1</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.170" end="00:38:48.500" style="s2">the transition from step one to step 2</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.549" end="00:38:50.510" style="s2">is choosing to then take full</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.510" end="00:38:54.230" style="s2">actually going to show up in the world I</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.950" end="00:38:56.329" style="s2">would call this reclaiming your</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.230" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">sovereignty I&#39;ve described sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.329" end="00:39:01.730" style="s2">in other places so I won&#39;t go into too</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:05.480" style="s2">much detail but sovereignty begins here</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.730" end="00:39:07.670" style="s2">that is an effect in you it is your</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.480" end="00:39:10.789" style="s2">capacity to take responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.670" end="00:39:12.799" style="s2">choices that you make in the world to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.789" end="00:39:15.049" style="s2">able to say I and I alone and solely</p>

<p begin="00:39:15.049" end="00:39:19.369" style="s2">and the first choice that I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.569" end="00:39:22.279" style="s2">make is the choice to get better at</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.279" end="00:39:28.190" style="s2">from there okay and as you continue to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:30.440" style="s2">expand your we might call sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.190" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">sovereignty the space of life in which</p>

<p begin="00:39:37.779" end="00:39:46.550" style="s2">then you enter into the third step and</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.550" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">right relationship and some portion that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.880" end="00:39:54.380" style="s2">is vocation by the way is it turns out I</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:56.900" style="s2">actually outlined this portion of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.380" end="00:40:00.020" style="s2">post that I talked about so it&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:01.970" style="s2">a nice loop close naturally so the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.020" end="00:40:03.700" style="s2">relationship is from perspective from a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.970" end="00:40:07.190" style="s2">place of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.700" end="00:40:12.260" style="s2">how&#39;d you begin to show up in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:13.460" style="s2">relationship in a better way and of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.260" end="00:40:15.230" style="s2">course generally speaking this would</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.460" end="00:40:16.430" style="s2">tend to be the first close relationships</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.230" end="00:40:18.440" style="s2">but you might think of this as all old</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.430" end="00:40:20.690" style="s2">relationships how do you enter into</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.440" end="00:40:23.240" style="s2">relationship with nature how do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.690" end="00:40:26.030" style="s2">introduce relationship with money how do</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.240" end="00:40:28.940" style="s2">you enter into a relationship with time</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.030" end="00:40:31.220" style="s2">right it&#39;s just all relationships can</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.940" end="00:40:32.390" style="s2">you use sovereignty this is developing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.220" end="00:40:35.630" style="s2">and capacities to make better choices</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.390" end="00:40:37.490" style="s2">and to sense what a better choice feels</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.630" end="00:40:39.500" style="s2">like without having to use knowing</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.490" end="00:40:41.240" style="s2">without having to use some prefab schema</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.500" end="00:40:44.090" style="s2">of what the right choices is it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.240" end="00:40:48.050" style="s2">handed down to you by probably somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.090" end="00:40:50.260" style="s2">else&#39;s story do you build a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.050" end="00:40:52.070" style="s2">begin entering into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.260" end="00:40:53.270" style="s2">and I should mention by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.070" end="00:40:55.910" style="s2">starting at the center like starting</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.270" end="00:41:00.350" style="s2">with the people who you love is a really</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.910" end="00:41:02.270" style="s2">good place to start this by the way will</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.350" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">uncork for anyone who&#39;s worried about a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.270" end="00:41:05.650" style="s2">feeling of meaning this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.800" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">feeling of meaning is most fully</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.650" end="00:41:09.530" style="s2">revealed and an example might thereby</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:13.610" style="s2">Pierce a thing that used to be called</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.530" end="00:41:14.840" style="s2">vocation or are calling as you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.610" end="00:41:17.030" style="s2">build sovereignty you will also be able</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.840" end="00:41:19.010" style="s2">to fill in yourself that which is in</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.030" end="00:41:21.950" style="s2">fact your calling what is your right</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.010" end="00:41:23.690" style="s2">relationship with doing in the world as</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.950" end="00:41:26.060" style="s2">opposed to some notion of like I ought</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.690" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">to do something or I have a duty to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.060" end="00:41:29.960" style="s2">something or I can I can tell myself the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.760" end="00:41:31.340" style="s2">story that makes sense that I will do</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.960" end="00:41:32.660" style="s2">something even though I hate it nope</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.340" end="00:41:34.490" style="s2">what is your calling</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.660" end="00:41:36.950" style="s2">what is your vocation doesn&#39;t of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.490" end="00:41:38.510" style="s2">step and of course you can notice that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.950" end="00:41:39.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no a really positive loop that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.510" end="00:41:41.690" style="s2">adds you enter into more and more right</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.980" end="00:41:44.030" style="s2">relationship with more and more of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.690" end="00:41:45.770" style="s2">world this gives you more capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.030" end="00:41:48.520" style="s2">build your own sovereignty you get help</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.770" end="00:41:50.690" style="s2">from friends who will give you</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.520" end="00:41:52.280" style="s2">evolutionary feedback that helps you get</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.690" end="00:41:55.160" style="s2">more insight into where your sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.280" end="00:41:57.830" style="s2">can perhaps improve the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.160" end="00:41:59.480" style="s2">competence has been expanded yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.830" end="00:42:01.850" style="s2">right and and the in</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.480" end="00:42:03.950" style="s2">banded from self to other expanded into</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.850" end="00:42:08.840" style="s2">into into something like a wheat like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.950" end="00:42:10.130" style="s2">team our family or friendship and of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.840" end="00:42:11.960" style="s2">course then as your sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.130" end="00:42:13.730" style="s2">increases your capacity to enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.960" end="00:42:15.859" style="s2">relationship increases that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.730" end="00:42:17.930" style="s2">nice right so then we enter into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.859" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">final step and I would call that step</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.930" end="00:42:25.880" style="s2">the step of coherence and this is may or</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:27.410" style="s2">may not be a calling for people in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.880" end="00:42:32.750" style="s2">meaningful time frame but for some</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.410" end="00:42:34.990" style="s2">people it might be so this is where you</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.750" end="00:42:38.030" style="s2">feel called your right relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.990" end="00:42:42.920" style="s2">the calling to enter into a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.030" end="00:42:45.740" style="s2">of collective sovereignty where there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.920" end="00:42:48.070" style="s2">a feeling of connection to some other</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.740" end="00:42:51.220" style="s2">people or person that was just one</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.070" end="00:42:55.940" style="s2">oftentimes just one the dyad a partner</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.220" end="00:43:01.090" style="s2">to so fully enter into relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.940" end="00:43:01.090" style="s2">you actually learn how to enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.109" end="00:43:11.570" style="s2">level of fluidity a level of honesty a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.290" end="00:43:15.560" style="s2">level of integrity together that has in</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.570" end="00:43:19.609" style="s2">some sense its own kind of identity that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.560" end="00:43:23.000" style="s2">the synergistic relationship gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.609" end="00:43:25.580" style="s2">to a wholeness that is greater than the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.000" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">sum of the parts and is fully nurturing</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.580" end="00:43:31.490" style="s2">to the continuing sovereignty of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:33.650" style="s2">parts and we find this I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:35.780" style="s2">really feel about a good partnership is</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.650" end="00:43:39.260" style="s2">like I&#39;m thinking here a marriage but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.780" end="00:43:40.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be that you can think</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.260" end="00:43:43.100" style="s2">and in fact I think it&#39;s just proper to</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.790" end="00:43:47.000" style="s2">think that there are three different</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.100" end="00:43:49.790" style="s2">entities there is the two humans and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.000" end="00:43:51.710" style="s2">relationship are all real and that as</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.790" end="00:43:54.380" style="s2">the humans enter into their sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.710" end="00:43:56.680" style="s2">and enter into skillfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.380" end="00:44:00.590" style="s2">relationship the relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.680" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">begins to have a capacity to nurture the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.590" end="00:44:08.119" style="s2">human beings and this is coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:10.869" style="s2">this is very real and in the space of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.119" end="00:44:13.590" style="s2">coherence we are now playing game be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.869" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.590" end="00:44:17.550" style="s2">to enter into larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:19.710" style="s2">relationships of coherence as that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.550" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">domain begins to expand and expand and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.710" end="00:44:27.150" style="s2">include more people yep</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.660" end="00:44:30.510" style="s2">but it needs to be taken slowly why well</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.150" end="00:44:34.440" style="s2">our generation is still habitually</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.510" end="00:44:37.380" style="s2">playing game at and so it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.440" end="00:44:40.860" style="s2">fall into those old habits it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.380" end="00:44:45.600" style="s2">easy to strategize for example it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.860" end="00:44:49.230" style="s2">easy to run unconscious old code and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.600" end="00:44:50.460" style="s2">we enter into relationship and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.230" end="00:44:52.650" style="s2">my dog is telling me our our</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.460" end="00:44:54.660" style="s2">conversation is at an end and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.650" end="00:44:57.330" style="s2">a great that&#39;s a fantastic way to call</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.660" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">like this is your two-minute warning</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.330" end="00:44:59.910" style="s2">guys</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:03.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve yes it&#39;s we time and warp time</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.910" end="00:45:04.830" style="s2">it&#39;s we determine what time and so um so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.660" end="00:45:08.430" style="s2">that&#39;s the story like that&#39;s I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.830" end="00:45:10.110" style="s2">it it seems very simple and compared to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.430" end="00:45:11.630" style="s2">like we&#39;re going to engineer a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.110" end="00:45:15.150" style="s2">decentralized economy on the bay right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.630" end="00:45:19.080" style="s2">but it is actually that simple and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.150" end="00:45:21.000" style="s2">yet not at all easy I understand Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.080" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">thank you so much for your time I feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.000" end="00:45:25.170" style="s2">we could have gone on for an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:27.300" style="s2">longer but as everyone knows the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.170" end="00:45:30.440" style="s2">sovereignty of the dog and also the we</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.300" end="00:45:33.360" style="s2">time if the dog is very important so we</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.440" end="00:45:35.880" style="s2">need to we need to let it go and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.360" end="00:45:37.830" style="s2">have it to ease in its poos and can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.880" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">tell the listeners where they can find</p>
