<p begin="00:00:11.010" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">a few ideas that I&#39;ve had that involve</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:18.930" style="s2">delivery so creating food in your own</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">kitchen if I want to make juice and make</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.930" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">enough for my neighbors and delivering</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">it to them it always seems like delivery</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:26.670" style="s2">is very much an added on perk that</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.590" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">remember because it was so long ago that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">I came up with it exactly how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">but let me just try having so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.890" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">who makes stuff in their own kitchen in</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.629" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">both a producer and consumer without</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">having better words for those things so</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">you make yogurt your neighbor makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">scarves whatever happens being your</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">ordering from each other and pane with</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:12.659" style="s2">an online system we&#39;re a small fraction</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">would go to keeping the site but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.659" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">actually getting it delivered to your</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">home and you know that your delivery</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">date is every Wednesday so you fill the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:24.380" style="s2">box with it and you pay certain amount</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">reason Amazon waited to create delivery</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">until they were much bigger because you</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">need to have a much bigger system in</p>
