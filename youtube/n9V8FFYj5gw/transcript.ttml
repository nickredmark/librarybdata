<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">statement kind of upping the ante with</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.670" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">thanks Jim yeah you know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.030" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">phenomenon that is increasingly common</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I think most faculty</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">have noticed in their careers teaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">in the last 10 years or so which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">bit of an inversion</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.880" style="s2">the tradition we&#39;re usually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">familiar with which is students</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.880" end="00:02:24.360" style="s2">protesting against police authority</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">students testing against university</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.580" end="00:02:36.630" style="s2">motion that was passed it was I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">for somebody who went to university the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.630" end="00:02:44.760" style="s2">1990s was you know sort of a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:46.709" style="s2">world that that unions motion said first</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.760" end="00:02:47.489" style="s2">of all you know this is a resolution on</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.709" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">hate speech</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.489" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a demand that the university</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">considers censoring preventing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">assignment of philosophical texts that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:04.049" style="s2">are that would be deemed illegal under</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:07.290" style="s2">British law and illegal because they</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.049" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">promote denigration or hatred of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.290" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">protected group so the the Student</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:15.540" style="s2">Union&#39;s motion said hey we think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:18.299" style="s2">laws at the governmental level should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.540" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">stronger that there should in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.299" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">stricter laws against what one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.280" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">permitted to say</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:27.720" style="s2">in the meantime whether or not those</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">laws are made stricter to prevent a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.720" end="00:03:30.620" style="s2">wider range of speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">Oxford University should take the lead</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.620" end="00:03:37.739" style="s2">and preemptively preventing certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:40.530" style="s2">texts from being discussed one thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.739" end="00:03:42.569" style="s2">that maybe might strike us particularly</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.530" end="00:03:45.959" style="s2">is that the tax systems are talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.569" end="00:03:49.370" style="s2">about or not let&#39;s say mine comp right</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">they&#39;re not text that we might consider</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.370" end="00:03:57.019" style="s2">you know extraordinarily offensive in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">the particular case they raised was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.019" end="00:04:02.540" style="s2">philosophical article about eugenics and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.690" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">in particular the question of whether</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.540" end="00:04:09.569" style="s2">one should selectively or should select</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:11.459" style="s2">embryos in order to avoid a child with</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.569" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">disabilities so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">strangeness there I think for those of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:18.389" style="s2">us you know joining the culture from an</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">earlier an earlier stage of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.389" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">yeah let me let me jump in there a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:25.349" style="s2">little bit you know I went to college</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:26.830" style="s2">university a full generation before you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.349" end="00:04:32.770" style="s2">I showed up in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.830" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">Brij Massachusetts in 1971 when we the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.770" end="00:04:38.259" style="s2">boomers were just given the finger to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">the GI Joe generation and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.259" end="00:04:41.979" style="s2">silence and we were basically just</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:44.020" style="s2">grabbing freedom you know we were still</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.979" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">very much in the shadow the famous</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.020" end="00:04:49.599" style="s2">Berkeley Free Speech Movement it was all</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:51.219" style="s2">about what should we be able to say on</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.599" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">campus anything we went goddamn well</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.219" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">blazed you know I get you right in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">further when I talk to people who&#39;d gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">to university just a little before me</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">used to be the university acted in loco</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:04.780" style="s2">parentis scene today for instance</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:06.490" style="s2">couldn&#39;t you bring your girlfriend&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.780" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">to your dorm room literally after 6</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.490" end="00:05:11.530" style="s2">o&#39;clock at night apparently was true</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:13.479" style="s2">till about 1967 five years for I showed</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.530" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">up four years for I showed up um I got</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.479" end="00:05:17.229" style="s2">there hey you were clever enough to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.000" style="s2">your girlfriend and cohabitating in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.229" end="00:05:20.590" style="s2">dorm room no one&#39;s gonna say a word</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.000" end="00:05:22.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve had an account at a local liquor</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.590" end="00:05:24.310" style="s2">store where we could order hooch should</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.719" end="00:05:27.699" style="s2">have it delivered to the front desk so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.310" end="00:05:30.250" style="s2">it was all about you know maximizing you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.699" end="00:05:32.889" style="s2">know personal freedom so again that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.250" end="00:05:34.389" style="s2">that&#39;s you know you know again from our</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.889" end="00:05:37.150" style="s2">my generation even more probably than</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.389" end="00:05:38.860" style="s2">yours this kind of you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.150" end="00:05:40.659" style="s2">want to legislate a police state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.860" end="00:05:43.089" style="s2">very odd and the other thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.659" end="00:05:45.129" style="s2">underline which I you know you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.089" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">in passing but I think distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.129" end="00:05:49.779" style="s2">this particular act from other you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">previous acts say you know the US</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.779" end="00:05:55.900" style="s2">universities this was not about</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:58.509" style="s2">censoring an outside speaker you know or</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.900" end="00:06:00.099" style="s2">dissuading reversing an invitation of an</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.099" end="00:06:05.560" style="s2">thought was you know problematic in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.250" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">in that horrible passive-aggressive term</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.560" end="00:06:11.289" style="s2">used by people on campus these days but</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">rather these were about assigned works</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.289" end="00:06:18.190" style="s2">by professors in class you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:21.400" style="s2">were specifically calling for overruling</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.190" end="00:06:23.770" style="s2">the British law with respect to academic</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.400" end="00:06:26.919" style="s2">freedom so this was an even stronger</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.919" end="00:06:34.629" style="s2">in the states you know we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.150" end="00:06:35.589" style="s2">different generations on this so one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.629" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">the things that I think we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.589" end="00:06:40.610" style="s2">used to is as students you know one of</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.219" end="00:07:28.099" style="s2">sort of generational dynamic that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.860" end="00:07:30.860" style="s2">has shifted and you know part of what I</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.860" end="00:07:36.610" style="s2">really a shift because you know to put</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.659" end="00:07:55.219" style="s2">the shift but if it really is a true</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.009" end="00:07:57.949" style="s2">shift towards you know a kind of Pro</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:22.009" style="s2">is is maybe think a little bit more</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.660" end="00:11:49.150" style="s2">what that idealogy is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.960" end="00:11:50.470" style="s2">there is a communist ideology in as much</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.270" end="00:12:25.870" style="s2">sense yes they&#39;re banning things because</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.950" end="00:12:27.520" style="s2">they have ideas and the ideas cause them</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.870" end="00:12:32.140" style="s2">to ban things because that&#39;s usually how</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.520" end="00:12:35.530" style="s2">ideas work but I&#39;m just not buying the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.140" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">thesis that there is a you know set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.530" end="00:12:41.410" style="s2">ideas coherent written down somewhere at</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.769" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">in his tweet storm and tweet hurricane</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.079" end="00:14:02.459" style="s2">around the tweet storm an idea of an</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.290" style="s2">alternative explanation that actually is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.459" end="00:14:08.040" style="s2">quite interesting called the cocktail</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.290" end="00:14:10.709" style="s2">party model why don&#39;t you roll that out</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.040" end="00:14:12.149" style="s2">for us well it&#39;s a gym yeah this is you</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.709" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">know right to get a hurricane I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.149" end="00:14:16.319" style="s2">you need an inversion layer right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:19.379" style="s2">what I&#39;m going to do is take seriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.319" end="00:14:20.999" style="s2">the possibility that these motions</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.379" end="00:14:22.499" style="s2">protests and again we have the the</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.079" end="00:14:29.220" style="s2">certain way it&#39;s unusual for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.579" end="00:14:30.509" style="s2">that you know Britain does not have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.220" end="00:14:34.709" style="s2">free speech laws that we do in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:38.850" style="s2">and so you know talking about prior</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.869" end="00:14:41.249" style="s2">restraint by the government in Britain</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.850" end="00:14:45.209" style="s2">is not you know a non-starter as it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.249" end="00:14:47.420" style="s2">in here in the US but what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.209" end="00:14:51.209" style="s2">do is figure out the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.420" end="00:14:55.049" style="s2">these students are actually taking the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.209" end="00:14:57.779" style="s2">university seriously they&#39;re taking a</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:05.490" style="s2">learned in in elite circles so this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:08.999" style="s2">you know a story about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.490" end="00:15:11.779" style="s2">let&#39;s say at Oberlin or Amherst Oxford</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.670" end="00:23:55.429" style="s2">and there&#39;s some classroom so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.960" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">different way to understand why ban this</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.429" end="00:24:02.090" style="s2">tax not because you know the person in</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.290" end="00:24:15.350" style="s2">really extensive theory about disability</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.260" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">and consciousness or whatever but simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.350" end="00:24:20.720" style="s2">because this just doesn&#39;t feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:25.060" style="s2">and the ruins of time</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.720" end="00:24:29.000" style="s2">I call it the hospitality filter right</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.060" end="00:24:33.220" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not hostile in fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.000" end="00:24:35.630" style="s2">ties back to the in some kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.220" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">linguistic way to the idea of a hostile</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.630" end="00:24:45.500" style="s2">environment it&#39;s not hospitable right I</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:47.660" style="s2">mean the idea and so the sense what</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.500" end="00:24:51.530" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that these students are</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.660" end="00:24:53.480" style="s2">taking the traditions of hospitality and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.530" end="00:24:54.740" style="s2">the cocktail Mar party or maybe even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.480" end="00:24:57.490" style="s2">dinner party might actually be a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.740" end="00:25:01.280" style="s2">closer but yes but some form of high</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.490" end="00:25:02.990" style="s2">hospitality as a true norm and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.280" end="00:25:04.430" style="s2">saying that if you have to if you now</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.990" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2">ensue that we&#39;re gonna include a much</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.430" end="00:25:10.070" style="s2">broader group of people our definition</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:12.530" style="s2">of hospitality has to change that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.070" end="00:25:14.180" style="s2">great Jim I like this I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.530" end="00:25:17.000" style="s2">mean one question is this do we want the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.180" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">ethic of hospitality to be the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.000" end="00:25:22.610" style="s2">beneath an educational experience right</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:25.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting I mean now you</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.610" end="00:25:27.080" style="s2">know it may be that it that it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:31.010" style="s2">under that it may put too many</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.080" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">constraints you know for instance and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.010" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">and I suspect we are under the influence</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">to a degree of some post modernist</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:41.390" style="s2">theory here because you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.130" style="s2">imagine anyone&#39;s going to call the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.390" end="00:25:45.380" style="s2">police on my dinner party because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.130" end="00:25:50.120" style="s2">violated some rule of hospitality right</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.380" end="00:25:54.410" style="s2">so we you know the the idea of making</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.120" end="00:25:56.690" style="s2">this a general will kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.410" end="00:25:58.610" style="s2">legally enforced doctrine is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.690" end="00:26:02.210" style="s2">hospitality by a long shot so there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.610" end="00:26:04.850" style="s2">somebody out there but maybe rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.210" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">at one level I like the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.850" end="00:26:08.810" style="s2">floated this idea because it explains</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">actually a lot it also explains as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.810" end="00:26:13.640" style="s2">mentioned in a tweet storm that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:16.220" style="s2">typically a phenomena of elite</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.450" end="00:29:45.169" style="s2">metaphor there are there are rules here</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.130" end="00:29:47.030" style="s2">to debate they&#39;re very different right</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.169" end="00:29:48.169" style="s2">they&#39;re not rules for example of insight</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.030" end="00:29:50.750" style="s2">I would say or you can necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.169" end="00:29:52.730" style="s2">learning I you can learn from watching a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.750" end="00:29:54.410" style="s2">debate but the participants in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.730" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">sense you win in a debate if you learn</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.410" end="00:29:59.299" style="s2">the least okay if your position changes</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:30:02.090" style="s2">the least over the course of it so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.299" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">know if we think okay like maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.090" end="00:30:05.090" style="s2">we you bought this gym which is great</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:07.610" style="s2">I&#39;m thrilled maybe you bought that okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.090" end="00:30:10.210" style="s2">this is the explanation about why we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.610" end="00:30:13.070" style="s2">having this other unusual moment where</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.210" end="00:30:14.929" style="s2">students are you know protesting in</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.070" end="00:30:16.760" style="s2">favor of greater restriction on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.929" end="00:30:19.340" style="s2">happening then we sell people with them</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.760" end="00:30:23.720" style="s2">what&#39;s next right do we have other</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.340" end="00:30:28.130" style="s2">models for how people can talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.720" end="00:30:30.890" style="s2">other in an open way in a way that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.130" end="00:30:33.140" style="s2">learn in a way that they develop their</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.890" end="00:30:35.390" style="s2">let&#39;s say dialectical abilities meeting</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.140" end="00:30:37.190" style="s2">their ability to to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.390" end="00:30:40.309" style="s2">develop their ideas over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.190" end="00:30:42.110" style="s2">time that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.309" end="00:30:44.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a really it&#39;s a really fun</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.110" end="00:30:47.510" style="s2">question a an important question</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.780" end="00:30:49.429" style="s2">right if elite universities are molding</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.510" end="00:30:51.260" style="s2">the minds of the leaders of the future</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.429" end="00:30:53.240" style="s2">and then we need to make sure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.260" end="00:30:55.040" style="s2">picking a metaphor and of course these</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.240" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">are all metaphors you know a cocktail</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.040" end="00:30:58.850" style="s2">party a boxing ring they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:01.130" style="s2">metaphors we don&#39;t actually we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.850" end="00:31:02.029" style="s2">actually enacting these things and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.130" end="00:31:04.940" style="s2">it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.029" end="00:31:07.820" style="s2">high stakes and you know when I you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.940" end="00:31:11.469" style="s2">I guess when I said I bought your model</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.820" end="00:31:14.299" style="s2">I well I think it&#39;s a fairly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.469" end="00:31:16.940" style="s2">explanation that fits the facts as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.299" end="00:31:18.889" style="s2">or better than any alternate it is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.940" end="00:31:19.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean I agree with the outcome by</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.889" end="00:31:23.210" style="s2">any means</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.460" end="00:31:25.009" style="s2">right oh you know kids calling the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.210" end="00:31:26.869" style="s2">cops on their professors for including a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.009" end="00:31:27.859" style="s2">philosophy paper in the class that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.869" end="00:31:31.340" style="s2"> nuts</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.859" end="00:31:35.450" style="s2">right and so I can see where we got to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.340" end="00:31:37.700" style="s2">via your analysis but personally and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.450" end="00:31:39.859" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just hey it&#39;s just okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.700" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">boomer time here it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.859" end="00:31:45.219" style="s2">something I think just I mean damn</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:48.229" style="s2">pissed off and my kids we&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.219" end="00:31:50.479" style="s2">$300,000 get educated like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.229" end="00:31:53.719" style="s2">in a different alternative equally</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.479" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">serious maybe more serious is University</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.719" end="00:31:59.629" style="s2">of Chicago right you can&#39;t get any more</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:02.989" style="s2">formal serious about the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.629" end="00:32:05.599" style="s2">content and yet with very very polite</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.599" end="00:32:11.389" style="s2">whole style of doing seminars and yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.059" end="00:32:14.019" style="s2">rigorous open free speech maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.389" end="00:32:17.179" style="s2">better alternative I mean let&#39;s do this</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.019" end="00:32:19.899" style="s2">takes a village right I mean you know</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.359" end="00:32:30.769" style="s2">humanities in the sense that there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.789" end="00:32:31.789" style="s2">when I was there as a postdoc there for</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.769" end="00:32:34.219" style="s2">a while and looking at how</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.349" end="00:32:54.139" style="s2">associated with the Harvard model right</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.669" end="00:32:57.909" style="s2">and the British model more generally</p>

<p begin="00:34:24.050" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">doing which is like let&#39;s read some</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.950" end="00:36:35.190" style="s2">to teach Aristotle you have to have some</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.570" end="00:36:36.810" style="s2">some way of dealing with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.190" end="00:36:38.730" style="s2">Aristotle is trying to change you as a</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:47.070" style="s2">perhaps cutting Rita taxed or how you</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.370" end="00:36:49.890" style="s2">see the world around you so you know we</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.070" end="00:36:52.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t get rid of discussion at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.890" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">right no nor quit you know certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.440" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">in the humanities and the social</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:57.210" style="s2">sciences it would be absurd exactly I</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:36:58.950" style="s2">mean you know let&#39;s go all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.210" end="00:37:01.350" style="s2">I mean look as a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.950" end="00:37:03.930" style="s2">fundamentalist for the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.350" end="00:37:05.190" style="s2">tradition right maybe we go back and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.930" end="00:37:07.290" style="s2">look what are the other models sitting</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.190" end="00:37:08.730" style="s2">there in the dialogues for example one</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.290" end="00:37:10.950" style="s2">of the other ways that people think</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.730" end="00:37:12.570" style="s2">about it here&#39;s one that you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.950" end="00:37:14.820" style="s2">right which is the Phaedrus language of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.570" end="00:37:15.420" style="s2">Socrates shows up works with a young guy</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.820" end="00:37:17.540" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.420" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">although Oxford does do that as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.540" end="00:37:21.720" style="s2">friend of mine once said the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:23.730" style="s2">being a class is depressed or Oxford I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.720" end="00:37:26.370" style="s2">put a great library and a little light</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.730" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">pederasty so but you&#39;ll fake this out</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.370" end="00:37:31.710" style="s2">good reasons done right thank you that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:33.600" style="s2">ok symposium you know it doesn&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.710" end="00:37:35.250" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s you know for these very</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.600" end="00:37:37.110" style="s2">reasons it conflicts with a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.250" end="00:37:38.460" style="s2">of thing that showed up and jeonse don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.110" end="00:37:40.440" style="s2">know who you want to blame for it i</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.460" end="00:37:42.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know may well download to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.440" end="00:37:44.160" style="s2">matrix right and we take on the identity</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.570" end="00:37:46.890" style="s2">if that still doesn&#39;t work generally</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.160" end="00:37:48.510" style="s2">because we are we are sitting here as</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.890" end="00:37:50.790" style="s2">people right sitting as people with pass</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.510" end="00:37:51.750" style="s2">if you don&#39;t understand Aristotle from</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.750" end="00:37:55.260" style="s2">pass you don&#39;t understand them I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.790" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">know I&#39;m racking my brain what else we</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.260" end="00:37:59.880" style="s2">have in the mean you know we have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:01.560" style="s2">Parmenides Parmenides it&#39;s like an old</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.880" end="00:38:03.870" style="s2">guy you know surrounded by people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.560" end="00:38:06.360" style="s2">basically are asking him to demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.870" end="00:38:07.740" style="s2">things if the me know okay we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.360" end="00:38:10.200" style="s2">the me know the me know involves like</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.740" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">enslaving someone that&#39;s out so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.200" end="00:38:13.710" style="s2">know maybe you know Jim like I guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:16.200" style="s2">what you&#39;re you know what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.710" end="00:38:18.180" style="s2">is the some we should really fund more</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.200" end="00:38:21.450" style="s2">cultural theory of Education that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.180" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">that&#39;s your that&#39;s your your radical</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.450" end="00:38:26.220" style="s2">left-wing position at the end of it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:28.470" style="s2">maybe where we actually you know instead</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.220" end="00:38:30.260" style="s2">of fighting something you should realize</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:33.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s telling us that there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.720" end="00:38:39.810" style="s2">students have revealed to us the they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:42.600" style="s2">revealed it to us I think in part like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.810" end="00:38:44.810" style="s2">place like Oxford by opening up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.600" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">working-class students by opening up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.810" end="00:38:50.670" style="s2">non-white students poking up to women I</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:54.530" style="s2">mean it took them ages but Oxford is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.670" end="00:38:56.970" style="s2">that&#39;s one tensions reveal in the u.s.</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.970" end="00:39:01.260" style="s2">now not just coming to the u.s. to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.490" end="00:39:03.990" style="s2">machine learning but also to you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.260" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">acquire a liberal education I think we</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.990" end="00:39:08.580" style="s2">should expect to see these tensions we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:11.940" style="s2">should expect them to have unusual</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.580" end="00:39:13.530" style="s2">outcomes and you know maybe the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.940" end="00:39:18.060" style="s2">following from that is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.530" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">expect that new ideas new cultural</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.060" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">practices around education those are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.540" style="s2">things we should be looking for how do</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:26.850" style="s2">you run a seminar differently it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.540" end="00:39:29.820" style="s2">first mover problem as well so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.850" end="00:39:32.100" style="s2">if you&#39;re let&#39;s say a striving</p>

<p begin="00:40:29.880" end="00:40:34.680" style="s2">what we would expect from college</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.710" end="00:40:35.910" style="s2">students but as Simon thinks about it a</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.680" end="00:40:38.490" style="s2">little bit he comes up with this</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.820" end="00:40:54.330" style="s2">you cross it with radical diversity and</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.330" end="00:41:03.260" style="s2">I would object to and I think Simon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.840" end="00:41:03.260" style="s2">sort of objects to let&#39;s just say that</p>

<p begin="00:41:13.770" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">riff which is what this ought to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.380" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">as is a flag that the whole concept of</p>

<p begin="00:44:29.329" end="00:44:33.500" style="s2">guys had and in a seminar room what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.089" end="00:44:35.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t know perhaps was that they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.500" end="00:44:37.609" style="s2">developing an idea that one day would</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.450" end="00:44:40.940" style="s2">blow up that very room that they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.609" end="00:44:42.320" style="s2">creating that idea and that is always</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.940" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">very exciting</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.320" end="00:44:46.220" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s why Jim I think I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.410" style="s2">little resistant to these kind of</p>

<p begin="00:45:01.070" end="00:45:04.820" style="s2">because there seems to be something off</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.390" end="00:45:06.890" style="s2">here self-censorship seems to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.820" end="00:45:09.020" style="s2">maybe what we&#39;re realizing is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.890" end="00:45:11.240" style="s2">whether or not any model requires</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.020" end="00:45:13.010" style="s2">censorship I would say secretly it does</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.240" end="00:45:14.900" style="s2">right there are things you can&#39;t say in</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.460" end="00:45:26.150" style="s2">regime that requires the kaku that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.530" end="00:45:29.060" style="s2">required by the cocktail party model</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.150" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">maybe that regime is is coming to an end</p>
