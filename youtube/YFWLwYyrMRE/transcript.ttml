<p begin="00:00:10.059" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">So on to Sigmund Freud</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.400" end="00:00:17.940" style="s2">We&#39;re going to give him somewhat short shrift. I&#39;m afraid because we only have an hour to talk about Freud, but that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.609" end="00:00:20.609" style="s2">We could get a fair way through it</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.880" end="00:00:28.199" style="s2">He&#39;s still persona non grata, I would say among experimental psychologists and probably clinical psychologists as well</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.199" end="00:00:31.108" style="s2">But that seems to me to be very unfair</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.809" end="00:00:34.619" style="s2">Freud Freud is one of those thinkers who?</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.770" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">All that&#39;s left are his mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.410" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">and the reason for that is that everything that he</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.050" end="00:00:48.509" style="s2">Discovered or put forward is so entrenched in our culture now that we think it&#39;s self-evident and so everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">correct has been assimilated and that just leaves everything that&#39;s more or less floating on top to look wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.699" end="00:01:01.439" style="s2">But Freud is also one of those thinkers who was always wrong in an interesting way and that&#39;s very useful. And so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.989" end="00:01:05.609" style="s2">also think that many of the things that he put his finger on that are of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.040" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">still disputed for example, the idea of the Oedipus complex are much more useful than people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.909" end="00:01:14.350" style="s2">admit</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.350" end="00:01:19.799" style="s2">especially in the clinical realm because the eatable complex which we&#39;ll talk about quite a bit is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">description of a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.310" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">stable</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:28.649" style="s2">form of familial psychopathology where</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.409" end="00:01:36.959" style="s2">child gets trapped within the confines of a family because the relationship with one parent or the other or both is so tight that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.570" end="00:01:41.639" style="s2">they can&#39;t break beyond it and maybe because of their own inability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.520" end="00:01:46.409" style="s2">move towards independence but more frequently because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.079" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">What you might describe as a kind of conspiracy between the son and and the parent or the child and the parent</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.560" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">that prevents them from</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.930" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.750" end="00:02:03.989" style="s2">Autonomous life and keeps them in a state of essentially a state of childhood dependence</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.310" end="00:02:13.589" style="s2">Freud said I started my professional activity as a neurologist trying to bring relief to my neurotic patients under the influence of an older friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.730" end="00:02:18.530" style="s2">And by my own efforts, I discovered some important new facts about the unconscious and psychic life</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:24.469" style="s2">The role of instinctual urges and so on out of these findings grew a new science psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:30.799" style="s2">A part of psychology and a new treatment for the neurosis. I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:34.819" style="s2">People did not believe in my facts and thought my theories unsavory</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.880" end="00:02:38.389" style="s2">Resistance was strong and unrelenting in the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.390" end="00:02:42.500" style="s2">I succeeded in inquiring pupils and building it up in international psychoanalytic Association</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.810" end="00:02:50.269" style="s2">But the struggle is not over he made that recording just shortly before he died. He moved to to England to escape the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:54.920" style="s2">Before Freud I guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">The mind was</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:05.779" style="s2">It&#39;s complicated because Freud of course was not the only person to be thinking along the lines that he thought Pierre</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">jennae</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:13.130" style="s2">who was one of his teachers had originated and started to develop many of the ideas that I would say were popularized by Freud but</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.209" end="00:03:17.869" style="s2">The idea of the unconscious mind was not</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.410" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">Certainly not as well developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.109" end="00:03:25.099" style="s2">prior to Freud as it became afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:28.910" style="s2">Before that I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:34.340" style="s2">You might say that insofar as people thought of the mind at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.340" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">They thought of in philosophical terms and the mind would be that part of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:41.989" style="s2">That&#39;s that you&#39;re aware of like in the dark in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.989" end="00:03:47.629" style="s2">The Cartesian sense Descartes said I think therefore I am and it kind of seems in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.910" end="00:03:53.269" style="s2">Self-evident that you&#39;re aware of and have control over the contents of your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.609" end="00:03:58.009" style="s2">But that was what Freud really questioned and he questioned it deeply said well</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">first of all the idea that you&#39;re one thing like one mind is a dubious idea to begin with because</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.069" end="00:04:11.149" style="s2">People are full of internal contradictions. And then the idea that your mind is all of one type</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:18.410" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all of one form was also very questionable as far as Freud was concerned because you could be fractionated into</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:20.459" style="s2">subcomponents and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.459" end="00:04:27.348" style="s2">You know the idea for example that your anger or your sexual desire could be an autonomous part of your personality in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.530" end="00:04:31.670" style="s2">It could overtake you and control you. That&#39;s really a Freudian idea and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.250" end="00:04:37.760" style="s2">one of the classic Freudian ideas really is that people are made out of sub personalities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:44.660" style="s2">Those sub personalities are alive. And that&#39;s one of the things I really like about the psychoanalytic thinkers because even the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.169" end="00:04:49.249" style="s2">Psychologists who say over the last thirty years are they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">Since maybe longer now</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:56.719" style="s2">anyways, since the demise of behaviorism as an ideology and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.510" end="00:05:00.619" style="s2">the admission by psychologists that there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.260" end="00:05:06.529" style="s2">There is an active unconscious or many active unconscious which is a better way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.230" end="00:05:12.709" style="s2">Psychologists still really haven&#39;t come to terms with the idea in any deep sense that these unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.200" end="00:05:15.709" style="s2">Processes are living things, you know there</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.470" end="00:05:23.749" style="s2">When psychologists talk for example about the cognitive unconscious they&#39;re talking about something that that they describe it more machine-like</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:30.049" style="s2">with more machine like metaphors and that&#39;s not reasonable you you understand things a lot better if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.630" end="00:05:36.260" style="s2">understand that the sub components that make up people the fragmentary bits of them and also the biological</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:40.100" style="s2">subsystems that that are part and parcel of your being are</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.860" end="00:05:43.880" style="s2">Much more intelligently viewed as personalities there</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:50.780" style="s2">there are kind of uni dimensional personalities in some sense so that for example, if you&#39;re angry you&#39;re nothing, but angry I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.780" end="00:05:56.869" style="s2">That&#39;s an overstatement obviously or if you&#39;re afraid you&#39;re nothing but afraid or if you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re nothing but hunger well</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.870" end="00:05:57.530" style="s2">That&#39;s certainly true</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.530" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">If you get hungry enough or thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">Or too hot or any of those things you you kind of collapsed to a simpler personality. That only has one</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.919" end="00:06:10.339" style="s2">Motivation in mind and we&#39;ll talk a lot as we progress about the grounding of those uni-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:14.840" style="s2">Motivational systems in biology, but I&#39;d have to say that Freud was</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.479" end="00:06:18.288" style="s2">among the first at least the first to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:23.750" style="s2">Synthesize a coherent theory of this multiplicity and to put it forth</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.539" end="00:06:29.749" style="s2">while also insisting that much of what was happening to you and inside of you was</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.450" end="00:06:32.100" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.100" end="00:06:34.100" style="s2">immediately accessible</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">To your awareness and it&#39;s a very profound. It&#39;s a very profound discovery</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.900" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">it means among any among many other things that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.039" end="00:06:46.039" style="s2">can formulate ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.500" end="00:06:48.859" style="s2">First of all, it means that you can act out things</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.239" style="s2">That you don&#39;t understand for reasons that you don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.940" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">also means that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:01.309" style="s2">Your memory can contain things that&#39;s represented in one way, but that can&#39;t be understood in another</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.310" end="00:07:08.089" style="s2">So for example, and we know this is true because there are independent memory systems. There&#39;s an independent memory system for procedures</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.280" end="00:07:10.699" style="s2">That&#39;s for actions. There&#39;s an independent</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:19.159" style="s2">memory system for what you might describe as imagination for for the memory that uses images and then there&#39;s a another system that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.469" end="00:07:26.599" style="s2">articulates knowledge that&#39;s the semantic memory system and it&#39;s not obvious at all that the contents of all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.879" end="00:07:29.359" style="s2">equivalent and that&#39;s why for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.030" end="00:07:36.530" style="s2">you can dream things that you don&#39;t know because one of the things you might think is that your dreams watch you act and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.530" end="00:07:41.780" style="s2">Watch other people act and then they make a little drama out of that and that drama has information in it</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.780" end="00:07:46.489" style="s2">But you don&#39;t necessarily know what that information is in that you can&#39;t describe it consciously</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.039" end="00:07:51.169" style="s2">Right. It&#39;s it&#39;s akin to the PA Chetty an idea. That kids can play a game</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.229" end="00:07:56.839" style="s2">and you can take them away from the game and then they won&#39;t know how to describe the rules even though they can play the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.840" end="00:08:00.380" style="s2">Game and so dreams can contain information. That&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.630" end="00:08:06.679" style="s2">the encoding of behavior that has information in it that you&#39;re not consciously aware of and so then you can become</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.870" end="00:08:09.709" style="s2">consciously aware of that in a kind of a revelation side</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.719" end="00:08:14.778" style="s2">Maybe that&#39;s what you do when you become aware of the meaning of a dream or the meaning of a fantasy or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.779" end="00:08:15.900" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.900" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">That&#39;s all all our ability to think that way in some ways can be traced back to Freud</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.699" end="00:08:29.359" style="s2">Now Freud concentrated mostly I would say at least in terms of pathology on</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:31.259" style="s2">sexual and aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.259" end="00:08:36.049" style="s2">Impulses and I I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s any mystery for modern people</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:44.149" style="s2">about why aggressive impulses might be particularly difficult to integrate into the personality and might remain underdeveloped or will say</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.790" end="00:08:47.269" style="s2">repressed although those aren&#39;t the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.269" end="00:08:51.859" style="s2">I think in order to you might think that in different times in society</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:58.130" style="s2">Some things are allowed to surface express themselves and other things are less allowed. And so</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.770" end="00:09:01.129" style="s2">Victorian times had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.620" end="00:09:07.850" style="s2">characteristics that made the repression of sexuality particularly likely and perhaps also the repression of aggression and we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.980" end="00:09:11.690" style="s2">Victorian times in in Europe, obviously and only one time in one place</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.590" end="00:09:17.299" style="s2">As Henry or Ellen Burgess says this is a great book by the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.300" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">the discovery of the unconscious if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.100" end="00:09:25.160" style="s2">If you&#39;re really interested in psychoanalytic ideas Freud Jung and Adler and also the history of those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:31.460" style="s2">There&#39;s no better book than the discovery of the unconscious. It&#39;s an absolutely remarkable book a great work of scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.460" end="00:09:33.460" style="s2">I think it it goes for about</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.660" end="00:09:39.349" style="s2">250 pages before it even gets to Freud and so it places Freud&#39;s discoveries in their historical context</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.350" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">So that&#39;s a really good thing to know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:45.770" style="s2">Allen Burgess says it was a world shaped by man for man in which women occupied the second place</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.200" end="00:09:52.039" style="s2">Political rights for women did not exist the separation and dissimilarity of the sexes was sharper than today</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:59.089" style="s2">women who wore slacks their hair shorter smoked were hardly to be found and the universities admitted no female students, man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.220" end="00:10:03.799" style="s2">Authority over his children and his wife was unquestioned education was authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.020" end="00:10:09.739" style="s2">The despotic father was a common figure and was particularly conspicuous only when he became extremely cruel</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.140" end="00:10:15.679" style="s2">Laws were more repressive delinquent youth sternly punished and corporal punishment was considered indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.810" end="00:10:24.890" style="s2">So the times themselves I would say were harsher and more repressive but then there was an element to sexuality that was also</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:27.930" style="s2">Extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.930" end="00:10:35.330" style="s2">Problematic. I mean the first thing you might notice might consider and people generally don&#39;t it&#39;s almost impossible to overstate</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:37.710" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.710" end="00:10:40.519" style="s2">revolutionary the birth control pill actually is</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.100" end="00:10:47.780" style="s2">You know people like to think that the political rights that women have attained have been a consequence of a political struggle</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.780" end="00:10:50.809" style="s2">But I don&#39;t buy that for a second. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true even in the least</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.810" end="00:10:56.330" style="s2">I think that what happened was that we underwent a biological revolution in the 1950s late</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.700" end="00:11:01.819" style="s2">1950s with the emergence of the birth control pill and that for the first time in human history gave women</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.340" end="00:11:07.819" style="s2">Pretty reliable control over the reproductive function not really transformed them into entirely different biological</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:13.339" style="s2">beings in many many ways like here&#39;s an example a subtle example, so, you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.860" end="00:11:15.860" style="s2">if you track women through their</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.589" end="00:11:19.579" style="s2">Ovulation cycle and you show them a picture of a man same man</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.580" end="00:11:22.639" style="s2">And you do nothing but vary his jaw width</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.950" end="00:11:27.589" style="s2">When they&#39;re ovulating the guy with the wider jaw is more attractive and when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.750" end="00:11:33.500" style="s2">Ovulating the farthest away from that the guy with the thinner jaw is more attractive and that&#39;s associated with testosterone levels</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.500" end="00:11:39.529" style="s2">And so women who are fertile like more masculine men and basically if you&#39;re on the pill then you&#39;re never in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.999" style="s2">Ovulation phase and so one thing that may have happened and I don&#39;t know this for sure</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:46.130" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to consider is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.320" end="00:11:49.700" style="s2">Since women have been taking the birth control pill their preference for less</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.800" end="00:11:56.089" style="s2">masculine men has become more pronounced and that could easily be one of the things that&#39;s fueling at least some of the tension that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.250" end="00:12:02.539" style="s2">Existed and exists now politically between men and women, but the point is is that you just cannot ignore</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.089" end="00:12:10.489" style="s2">The massive consequences of a biological revolution like that and to make any other factor causal when you&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:17.299" style="s2">The political movement movements especially in the last say 40 years. It&#39;s you&#39;re putting the cart before the horse now</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:23.450" style="s2">It&#39;s reasonable to point out that the pill wouldn&#39;t have been accepted as a technology if certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.880" end="00:12:29.419" style="s2">Political changes with regards to the emancipation of women hadn&#39;t already been in place, right?</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.420" end="00:12:33.500" style="s2">No one would have even been allowed to do something like investigate contraception</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.500" end="00:12:36.890" style="s2">So you can&#39;t separate the biological from the political entirely</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.890" end="00:12:43.729" style="s2">but it&#39;s still it&#39;s still very useful to organize your organizing your thinking to realize just how profound a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.510" end="00:12:48.289" style="s2">Revolution that was but now back in the Victorian times</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.290" end="00:12:50.190" style="s2">There&#39;s another thing about sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.190" end="00:12:55.309" style="s2">Modern people like to think that there&#39;s nothing dangerous about sex and that is like the stupidest thing you could possibly ever</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.220" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">Hypothesize because everything about it is dangerous. It&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.640" end="00:13:01.879" style="s2">Emotionally it&#39;s dangerous socially</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.980" end="00:13:03.980" style="s2">it&#39;s dangerous because of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.110" end="00:13:09.979" style="s2">Possibility of unwanted pregnancy and it&#39;s dangerous because of the possibility of sickness and that&#39;s a major one</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.980" end="00:13:10.470" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.470" end="00:13:16.790" style="s2">So when aids emerged in the 1980s that could have easily killed all of us now the fact that it didn&#39;t was wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.790" end="00:13:21.500" style="s2">But it did kill hundreds of millions of people. So it was no joke. It was a big deal and</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.160" end="00:13:23.190" style="s2">ADEs</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.190" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">mutated to take advantage of promiscuity and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.480" end="00:13:34.430" style="s2">Relationship between sexual behavior and the transmission of disease is actually mediated at the biological level. But anyways back in the 1890s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.430" end="00:13:39.979" style="s2">They had the same problem, right? They had the problem with syphilis and syphilis is one nasty disease</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.980" end="00:13:46.819" style="s2">it&#39;s it can mimic almost any other disease and it&#39;s devastating to your nervous system and you can pass it on to your children and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.889" end="00:13:53.119" style="s2">so part of the reason that sexuality was heavily repressed in the Victorian period was not only because of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.430" end="00:13:57.019" style="s2">possibility of unwanted pregnancy the relative poverty of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.019" end="00:14:03.679" style="s2">You know back in 1895 in Europe the average person lived on less than a dollar a day in in modern terms</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:05.060" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.060" end="00:14:08.239" style="s2">it&#39;s almost impossible to understand how poor people were and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:15.799" style="s2">sex in a poverty-stricken place is also a lot more dangerous than it is in a rich place because especially if you were, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.319" end="00:14:18.319" style="s2">given the lack of employment</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:23.180" style="s2">opportunities for women back in the Victorian period if you happen to get pregnant out of wedlock you were and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.339" end="00:14:24.870" style="s2">You were in serious trouble</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.870" end="00:14:30.199" style="s2">and so the fact that sexuality was repressed is hardly as hardly a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.420" end="00:14:36.439" style="s2">surprise because it was so difficult to integrate into the full-fledged personality, you know, and it has it as it still is so</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.130" end="00:14:39.990" style="s2">Sexual repression</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.990" end="00:14:45.349" style="s2">supposedly characteristic feature of the Victorian period was often merely the expression of two facts the lack of diffusion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.569" end="00:14:52.339" style="s2">contraceptives and the fear of venereal disease it was all the more dangerous because of the great spread of prostitution and because prostitutes were almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.470" end="00:15:00.470" style="s2">Invariably contaminated and therefore potential sources of infection we can hardly imagine today how monstrous silithus syphilis appeared to people of that time</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:06.350" style="s2">Well, we can imagine that a little bit better than they could in 1970 because it hasn&#39;t you know, AIDS is still with us</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.350" end="00:15:08.899" style="s2">Although it&#39;s nowhere near the plague that it was say</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.449" end="00:15:11.449" style="s2">25 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.899" end="00:15:15.018" style="s2">Well, here&#39;s the Freudian world Freud</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s take a look at the history of or the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:23.000" style="s2">Unconscious to begin with and one of the things that you might want to consider</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.699" end="00:15:26.539" style="s2">Conceptually is that there are many different forms of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.540" end="00:15:33.230" style="s2">There&#39;s not just one and so Alan bursae points out that by 1904 functions of the unconscious had been described</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">There&#39;s a conservative function. So the unconscious stores memories often unaccessible to voluntary recall</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.620" end="00:15:42.350" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s a strange one, you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.350" end="00:15:45.350" style="s2">obviously you remember your past but you don&#39;t remember all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.630" end="00:15:51.229" style="s2">What you can remember at any given time and you don&#39;t really have access to that full store of memories</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.230" end="00:15:54.620" style="s2">although you can try to remember so the unconscious is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.500" end="00:15:58.669" style="s2">You could imagine the memories are represented somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:06.589" style="s2">Neurologically, but neural the neurological structure isn&#39;t exactly the mind like the neurological structure isn&#39;t exactly your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.589" end="00:16:10.069" style="s2">There&#39;s some relationship between them that we don&#39;t know and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.680" end="00:16:14.750" style="s2">from a conceptual perspective is the place that your memories are that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.180" end="00:16:18.709" style="s2">Sometimes can get access to and sometimes can&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.290" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">you might think well that there are the memories that you can&#39;t get access to there might be a variety of reasons you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:27.860" style="s2">access to them one might be that you&#39;ve just forgotten them and</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.440" end="00:16:32.029" style="s2">One might be that they&#39;re so painful that you don&#39;t want to bring them to mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.029" end="00:16:36.619" style="s2">You&#39;ll you&#39;ll engage in tricks to stop yourself from getting access to them</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.620" end="00:16:43.130" style="s2">And or maybe they&#39;re memories that are so complex that and painful that even if you did get access to them</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.130" end="00:16:45.140" style="s2">You wouldn&#39;t exactly know what to do with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.140" end="00:16:50.479" style="s2">and so there&#39;s not a lot of reason for you to bring them to mind because all it is is pain without any without any</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.180" end="00:16:56.719" style="s2">Utility and when you understand that a little bit you understand more about what Freud meant by repression</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.180" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">The thing about Freud is that he kind of believed that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:05.359" style="s2">like many people believe now that when you remember an event in the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:11.420" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re using a video tape recorder and that when you experience that the memory is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.699" end="00:17:13.699" style="s2">Recorded in you like it happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.309" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">But that&#39;s not a very accurate version of how memory works I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.319" end="00:17:21.949" style="s2">We know that memories can be easily distorted</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.380" end="00:17:23.270" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.270" end="00:17:25.400" style="s2">if you interview someone about an event and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.470" end="00:17:31.970" style="s2">You make suggestions that there was something present in the event that wasn&#39;t there and then you bring them back a couple of weeks later</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.970" end="00:17:33.470" style="s2">And you ask them about the same event?</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.470" end="00:17:37.309" style="s2">they&#39;ll often incorporate the thing that they were told into the event and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.590" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">So and the idea that you can make an objective record of something that&#39;s happening to you is kind of a strange notion anyways</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:47.780" style="s2">because so for example if you&#39;re having an argument with someone and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.540" end="00:17:53.239" style="s2">Later you I asked what the argument was about and the other person has asked what the argument is about</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.460" end="00:17:56.449" style="s2">there&#39;s no necessary reason why the accounts will</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:02.750" style="s2">Jibe at all because a lot of time when you&#39;re having an argument with someone you&#39;re arguing about what the argument is about</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.910" end="00:18:07.549" style="s2">Right say well, you&#39;re angry at me. Well why this is why I think you&#39;re angry at me</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.590" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">You say no this is why I think this event has occurred and you&#39;re thinking about especially if we know each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:19.129" style="s2">Well, you&#39;re thinking about the contextualization of that event across our entire history</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.130" end="00:18:25.309" style="s2">and I&#39;m doing the same thing and I&#39;m gonna highlight things that you&#39;re not gonna highlight and I&#39;m gonna draw causal inferences that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.309" end="00:18:29.689" style="s2">Going to draw and for us just to get on the same page about the memory. It&#39;s going to be very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:34.850" style="s2">So the idea that in specially with complex interactions with people that you can somehow</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.190" end="00:18:40.669" style="s2">make a video recording of the memory and actually capture what happens is is very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.910" end="00:18:47.269" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s not true. You you can&#39;t I mean you might be able to extract out certain objective facts, but</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.030" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">But generally if it&#39;s a dialogical issue if it&#39;s a relationship issue</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:56.569" style="s2">It spans such a long period of time that just cutting a slice of it out doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.910" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">constitute a reasonable record of what it means and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.809" end="00:19:05.359" style="s2">That&#39;s what you&#39;re more concerned with - like when when you have an experience, you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not so much concerned about what happened from an objective perspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.940" end="00:19:13.340" style="s2">You&#39;re more concerned about what the experience means and then you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.340" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">Well, what does it mean to mean something and that was the question? I was trying to answer in that paper</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:21.049" style="s2">I had you read right at the beginning of the class</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.049" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">but one of the things that meaning means is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.530" end="00:19:30.349" style="s2">Implication for the way you look at the world or the way you act in the world. And so if I tell you something meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.929" end="00:19:35.149" style="s2">what that&#39;s going to mean is in the future you&#39;re going to act slightly differently or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.370" end="00:19:41.059" style="s2">Radically differently depending on how meaning it meaningful it is but also that the way that you look at the world has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.610" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">And the way that you look at the world is actually an unconscious. It&#39;s actually an unconscious process</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:46.919" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.919" end="00:19:48.030" style="s2">You don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.030" end="00:19:52.790" style="s2">While you&#39;re looking at the world how it is or why it is that you&#39;re looking at the world in that way</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.790" end="00:19:55.009" style="s2">I mean because well</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.770" end="00:20:01.129" style="s2">First of all, it would just be too complicated and second you wouldn&#39;t be able to concentrate on what was actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.290" end="00:20:03.290" style="s2">So your attention?</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.350" end="00:20:10.850" style="s2">For example is mediated by unconscious forces and you know that you know that perfectly well and this is another Freudian observation, you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.850" end="00:20:12.850" style="s2">if you&#39;re sitting down to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.830" end="00:20:15.179" style="s2">study</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.179" end="00:20:16.160" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.160" end="00:20:20.059" style="s2">your conscious intent is to study but you know perfectly well that all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:23.959" style="s2">Distraction fantasies are going to enter the theater of your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.690" end="00:20:30.230" style="s2">Non-stop and annoyingly and and there isn&#39;t really a lot you can do about that except maybe wait it out, you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.230" end="00:20:35.299" style="s2">So you&#39;ll be sitting there reading and your attention will flicker away. You&#39;ll think about I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.299" end="00:20:38.299" style="s2">Maybe you want to watch the G in the virgin on Netflix or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.299" end="00:20:40.140" style="s2">Or maybe it&#39;s time to have a peanut butter sandwich</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.140" end="00:20:45.949" style="s2">or you should get the dust bunnies from out from underneath the bed or it&#39;s time to go outside and have a cigarette or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.950" end="00:20:51.530" style="s2">It&#39;s time for a cup of coffee or it&#39;s like all these subsystems in you that would like something aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.110" end="00:20:58.219" style="s2">Very happy just to sit there while you read this thing that you&#39;re actually bored by and so they pop up and try to take</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.220" end="00:21:03.049" style="s2">Control of your perceptions and your actions non-stop. Maybe you think well, this is a stupid course</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.049" end="00:21:07.969" style="s2">Anyways, why do I have to read this damn paper? And what am I doing in university? And what&#39;s the point of life?</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:10.039" style="s2">It&#39;s like you can really well</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.039" end="00:21:15.529" style="s2">You can really get going if you&#39;re trying to avoid doing your homework and and and then you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:18.019" style="s2">what is it in you that&#39;s trying to avoid because</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.289" end="00:21:24.469" style="s2">After all, you took the damn course and you told yourself to sit down. Why don&#39;t you listen?</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.289" end="00:21:32.569" style="s2">Well, because you&#39;re you&#39;re a mess now. That&#39;s basically why you haven&#39;t got control over yourself at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:36.169" style="s2">And no more than I have control over this laptop</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.309" end="00:21:44.809" style="s2">Okay, so there&#39;s the memory function of the unconscious and there&#39;s the dis dis eluted function</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.809" end="00:21:51.499" style="s2">That&#39;s an interesting one the unconscious contains habits once voluntary now are tamo ties and dissociated</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.720" end="00:21:56.089" style="s2">Elements of the personality which may lead a parasitic existence. That&#39;s an interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.150" end="00:22:02.539" style="s2">I would relate that more to procedural memory, you know, so what you&#39;ve done is practice certain habits, whatever they might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.669" end="00:22:06.559" style="s2">Let&#39;s call them bad habits and you like those things to get under control?</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.559" end="00:22:10.879" style="s2">But you can&#39;t so maybe when you&#39;re speaking for example, you use like and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:16.189" style="s2">And you say I&#39;m a lot and you&#39;ve practiced that so you&#39;re really good at it and you&#39;d like to stop it</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:21.290" style="s2">But you don&#39;t - because you&#39;ve built that little machine right into your being right? It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.810" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">Neurologically wired and it&#39;s not under conscious control and anything you practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:27.900" style="s2">becomes that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.900" end="00:22:32.150" style="s2">It becomes part of you and and that&#39;s another element of the unconscious a different part</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.150" end="00:22:35.539" style="s2">And then there&#39;s a creative part which is that well</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.540" end="00:22:39.410" style="s2">You know you&#39;re sitting around and maybe you&#39;re trying to write something or maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.440" end="00:22:46.039" style="s2">Produce a piece of art or a piece of music or maybe you&#39;re just laying in bed dreaming and you have all these weird ideas</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.200" end="00:22:51.590" style="s2">And especially in dreams. It&#39;s like what where do those things come from and even more strange?</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.220" end="00:22:58.699" style="s2">One of the things that&#39;s really weird about dreams and almost impossibly weird is that you&#39;re an observer in the dream</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:06.260" style="s2">It&#39;s like a dream is something that happens to you. Well, you&#39;re dreaming it theoretically so how is it that you can be an observer?</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.930" end="00:23:12.020" style="s2">It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re watching a video game or a movie but you&#39;re producing it that at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.420" end="00:23:18.860" style="s2">Although the psychoanalysts would say well, no not exactly your ego isn&#39;t producing it. Your unconscious is producing. It&#39;s a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.290" end="00:23:24.410" style="s2">It&#39;s a different thing. And of course Jung would say well it&#39;s deeper than that. The collective unconscious might be producing it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:25.770" style="s2">It&#39;s in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.770" end="00:23:26.970" style="s2">It isn&#39;t you?</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.970" end="00:23:27.470" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.470" end="00:23:33.260" style="s2">or it isn&#39;t the you that you think of when you think of you and that&#39;s the ego from the Freudian perspective the you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.260" end="00:23:35.299" style="s2">you identify with that&#39;s the ego and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:37.850" style="s2">outside of that is the unconscious the it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.700" end="00:23:42.260" style="s2">That&#39;s more the place of impulses and you could think about those as the biological</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:49.069" style="s2">Subsystems that can derail your thinking right and that govern things like hunger and sex and aggression and your basic</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.530" end="00:23:53.660" style="s2">instincts is another way of putting it and it&#39;s a reasonable way of thinking about it because these are</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.790" end="00:23:57.800" style="s2">Subsystems that you share with with animals you share them certainly with mammals</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.800" end="00:24:03.289" style="s2">You share most of them with reptiles you share a lot of them with em Finian&#39;s and even going all the way down to</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.510" end="00:24:07.249" style="s2">Crustaceans there&#39;s commonality for example in the dominance hierarchy circuits</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.250" end="00:24:12.589" style="s2">and so these are very very old things and the idea that you&#39;re in control of them is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.280" end="00:24:19.669" style="s2">Well, you&#39;re not exactly in control of them and I would say the less integrated you are</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:26.480" style="s2">The less you&#39;re in control of them and the more they&#39;re in control of you and that can get really out of hand, you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.660" end="00:24:31.249" style="s2">You can be like with people who have obsessive compulsive disorder. For example</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.680" end="00:24:33.390" style="s2">which which which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:39.590" style="s2">Which seems to be I would say that dissolute of elements in some sense of the unconscious the way that it&#39;s portrayed here</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.930" end="00:24:43.519" style="s2">Poor people with obsessive-compulsive disorder they can spend half their time</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.920" end="00:24:46.820" style="s2">Doing things that they can&#39;t really control and they have very strong</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.040" end="00:24:50.330" style="s2">Impulses to do them and it&#39;s very hard on them to block them</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.330" end="00:24:54.710" style="s2">You know, they they&#39;ll almost panic if those things are blocked and then you have people with Tourette&#39;s syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:58.759" style="s2">you know that they&#39;ll be doing all sorts of weird dances and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.370" end="00:25:03.620" style="s2">spouting off obscenities and and and and imitating people</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.140" end="00:25:06.410" style="s2">without being able to control it and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.380" end="00:25:11.989" style="s2">Sometimes a little bit of anti-psychotic medication can dampen that down but it&#39;s as if there are these autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.870" end="00:25:19.100" style="s2">semi spirits inside of them that grip control over their behavior and make them do things and you know,</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.100" end="00:25:21.409" style="s2">you find that to some degree in your own life because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.749" style="s2">You&#39;ve become very attractive to someone even maybe you don&#39;t want to be attracted to the person and then you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.970" end="00:25:31.429" style="s2">You know texting them when you know perfectly well that you should be going to bed and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.430" end="00:25:35.629" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re in a grip of something and and you can&#39;t control it and that&#39;s all part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:37.850" style="s2">unconscious and all part of what Freud was studying</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.420" end="00:25:46.730" style="s2">The dynamic unconscious it&#39;s alive and it&#39;s a compass that the mind is a composite of contradictory drives now</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.850" end="00:25:52.279" style="s2">The way Freud thought about this basically was that with the end and the ego and the super-ego</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.280" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">so if you think about the end as the place where these contradictory drives emerge</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:03.049" style="s2">So it&#39;s sort of nature within the ego is the thing that&#39;s sort of being pushed back and forth by those</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.270" end="00:26:10.340" style="s2">Contradictory drives and the super-ego is the thing that&#39;s on top saying you better behave yourself you better behave yourself and so it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.340" end="00:26:14.509" style="s2">model than the Piaget daeun model because Piaget assumed that what would happen is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.810" end="00:26:18.409" style="s2">As the child and I like the Piaget and model better</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.410" end="00:26:22.790" style="s2">I think I think in healthy development the Piaget daeun model is correct</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:24.530" style="s2">But in unhealthy development</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.530" end="00:26:26.600" style="s2">I think the Freudian model is correct that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.030" end="00:26:33.680" style="s2">Instead of integrating say the aggressive and sexual drives for the sake of argument into your personality as you develop</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.680" end="00:26:39.230" style="s2">What happens is the super-ego just represses them instead so they don&#39;t become a dynamic part of you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.750" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">Integrated into your ego. They&#39;re just repressed. You just don&#39;t manifest them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.490" end="00:26:47.550" style="s2">That&#39;s how you be a good person and you can be the victim of a very harsh</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:51.689" style="s2">super-ego and that often happens if you&#39;ve had a particularly tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:58.020" style="s2">Parent one or both or maybe a tyrannical grandparent or maybe you&#39;re your own inner tyrant</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.020" end="00:27:02.999" style="s2">And you&#39;ve picked up tyrannical voices through your whole life and aggregated them into this terrible judge</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.100" end="00:27:06.990" style="s2">that&#39;s always watching you that&#39;s criticizing everything you do and</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.420" end="00:27:13.319" style="s2">Restricting you badly and really badly and what you&#39;re allowed and not allowed to do you see that with anorexic women?</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.960" end="00:27:17.220" style="s2">Well men could be anorexic too, but it&#39;s much much less rare</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.220" end="00:27:20.250" style="s2">They have super egos that are just or one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.250" end="00:27:25.500" style="s2">That&#39;s just they&#39;re just deadly they&#39;re just criticizing every bit of them. Well right to the point</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.500" end="00:27:31.949" style="s2">They&#39;re really criticizing them out of existence right is you have to be so perfect that the perfection is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.290" end="00:27:38.129" style="s2">Aligned with the ability to live you don&#39;t get to eat, you know and and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.130" end="00:27:39.270" style="s2">They look at their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.270" end="00:27:41.999" style="s2">they even look at their bodies incorrectly like</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.460" end="00:27:48.120" style="s2">anorexic seem to be unable to see their bodies as a whole they can only see their bodies as parts and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.250" end="00:27:50.190" style="s2">When you start seeing your body as parts</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.190" end="00:27:56.070" style="s2">you&#39;re really in trouble because you can&#39;t get a sense of actually what it looks like and body perception is very very complicated, but</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.130" end="00:27:58.570" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.570" end="00:28:04.470" style="s2">Piaget thought about the ego as in some sense as the game that&#39;s played by all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.050" end="00:28:08.729" style="s2">Dynamic drives that&#39;s shaped by the broader community. And so that could all be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.730" end="00:28:11.849" style="s2">But Freud would say well look when that doesn&#39;t happen instead</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.860" end="00:28:16.410" style="s2">You&#39;re subject to the tyranny of the super-ego and it just says you should never be angry, right?</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.440" end="00:28:20.190" style="s2">You should never express yourself sexually because if you do there&#39;s something wrong with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.190" end="00:28:26.280" style="s2">you&#39;re a bad person and you&#39;re a bad person if you ever get aggressive or and so and then people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.470" end="00:28:28.470" style="s2">living like that under those circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.660" end="00:28:34.709" style="s2">You know they get they well they&#39;re they&#39;re repressed is the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.140" end="00:28:44.819" style="s2">Now Freud was interested in the idea that mental disorders could be caused for two reasons one would be purely</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.100" end="00:28:48.660" style="s2">Bodily, like maybe a head injury or say in the case of schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.660" end="00:28:51.029" style="s2">Which is a good example of manic depressive disorder</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.100" end="00:28:53.100" style="s2">we have reason to believe that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.530" end="00:29:00.089" style="s2">Physiological going on even though but identifying that has been very difficult and it&#39;s because there isn&#39;t one form of schizophrenia</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.279" end="00:29:02.518" style="s2">there&#39;s probably many pathways of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.009" end="00:29:04.629" style="s2">brain injury that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.629" end="00:29:11.009" style="s2">schizophrenic like symptoms and there&#39;s likely not one form of manic depressive disorder either if you think of the form as having a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:15.779" style="s2">Standard causal pathway. We know that there are because we&#39;ve done genetic Studies on people</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.899" end="00:29:23.579" style="s2">Who have manic depressive disorder in their family and you can identify genes within a family that seemed to be contributing to the disorder?</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.580" end="00:29:26.309" style="s2">but the problem is is that those genes don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:32.939" style="s2">so then you&#39;ll take another family group with manic depressive disorder and it&#39;ll be a different genetic combination that causes that so</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.700" end="00:29:35.700" style="s2">so part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.980" end="00:29:39.809" style="s2">It&#39;s difficult to associate the even the more biological</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.450" end="00:29:47.370" style="s2">Mental disorders with with biology all the way down is because they&#39;re so complex and then there are other forms of mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:51.239" style="s2">Disorder that don&#39;t seem to be structure at all structural at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.240" end="00:29:52.830" style="s2">They seem to have more to do with well</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.830" end="00:29:59.490" style="s2">Let&#39;s call it the psyche right and that it&#39;s more like the contents of your thought have a problem rather than the structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.950" end="00:30:05.100" style="s2">Underlying your thought and of course that distinction is difficult to make in a fine-grained way</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.100" end="00:30:06.690" style="s2">But you kind of get the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.690" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">I mean just because there&#39;s an error in your thinking doesn&#39;t mind really mean that the underlying biology in some sense has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.690" end="00:30:19.110" style="s2">compromised it&#39;s complicated because if the air is bad enough, then it can compromise the underlying biology but</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.629" end="00:30:24.689" style="s2">but whatever it&#39;s a conceptual distinction and part of the conceptual distinction is is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.090" end="00:30:31.319" style="s2">Helpful, if you&#39;re trying to think at least in part about how you might cure it because if you&#39;re thinking about a brain disease</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.870" end="00:30:33.870" style="s2">then that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.539" end="00:30:39.749" style="s2">Implies a different course of treatment at least in principle then it does if you&#39;re thinking about a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.149" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">disorder where you might</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:47.190" style="s2">think about talking to someone for example and straightening out their thoughts or helping them learn to behave in a different way and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.129" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">It was really Freud</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:51.639" style="s2">Who started to?</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.639" end="00:30:58.979" style="s2">Think that he was the first person to really pause it and this is pretty interesting that directly pause it that dialogue or conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.379" end="00:31:01.859" style="s2">Or speaking could be curative</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.860" end="00:31:06.569" style="s2">And now that&#39;s another thing that people don&#39;t like to give him credit for I mean there wouldn&#39;t be all these</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.299" end="00:31:12.449" style="s2">helping industries social social work and psychology and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.970" end="00:31:19.410" style="s2">Biological Psychiatry insofar as that also involves communication and counseling and all these things now that would have existed</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.170" end="00:31:24.719" style="s2">In all likelihood if Freud wouldn&#39;t have made the original</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.900" end="00:31:27.340" style="s2">hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.340" end="00:31:30.750" style="s2">There was something about communication that could be curative. No</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.630" end="00:31:33.630" style="s2">Freud believed that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.950" end="00:31:43.379" style="s2">Experiences that hadn&#39;t been now. He thought about experiences has repressed and this goes back to the videotape idea of memory</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.450" end="00:31:49.229" style="s2">so the idea would be that you have a record of everything that&#39;s happened to you and the records actually accurate and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.510" end="00:31:54.660" style="s2">then some of those things that happen to you were very very shocking to you were very hurtful or very</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.760" end="00:31:57.959" style="s2">depressing or very threatening and so you&#39;ve decided that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.310" end="00:32:04.739" style="s2">Those have become repressed you&#39;re not paying any attention to them now</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.740" end="00:32:09.959" style="s2">He has a complex mechanism to account for that and I actually think this is a place where his theory went badly wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.150" end="00:32:12.749" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have a videotape memory and</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.390" end="00:32:20.609" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious that the memories that you have of traumatic events are fully fledged and causally</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.310" end="00:32:26.249" style="s2">appropriate but just not paid attention to it&#39;s more like they&#39;re murky and</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.800" end="00:32:33.300" style="s2">Unclear in and of themselves and they contain too much and I don&#39;t think that people so much repress as they do</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.210" end="00:32:40.110" style="s2">refuse to attend to or are unable to attend to so it&#39;s more like a passive avoidance than a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.330" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">Passive avoidance of something that needs to be explored and gone through rather than it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.430" end="00:32:50.099" style="s2">something you know that you don&#39;t want to look at that you are part of you has put away and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.170" end="00:32:53.879" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a major weakness in his theory and has led to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.980" end="00:32:58.050" style="s2">Problems with the idea of repression per se. But anyways, that was his idea that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.780" end="00:33:03.839" style="s2">Terrible things have happened to you and you or some part of you doesn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:12.869" style="s2">To know about them to know about them. And so they live this those repressed experiences live an autonomous life of their own - and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.450" end="00:33:17.430" style="s2">You here&#39;s an example of a trivial example of how that might work</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.100" end="00:33:20.100" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re at work and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.140" end="00:33:26.009" style="s2">Your boss says something to you that disturbs you maybe it makes you question whether your job is stable</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.130" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">So you&#39;re kind of set about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:33.959" style="s2">But it&#39;s a casual offhand comment and you go back to work and you just sort of forget that that even happened, you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.330" end="00:33:36.090" style="s2">Maybe because you&#39;re attending to something else</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.090" end="00:33:37.480" style="s2">but then you go home and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.480" end="00:33:43.170" style="s2">Crabby as can possibly be and you go home and one of the people there says something a little annoying and you snap at them</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.390" end="00:33:47.910" style="s2">It&#39;s like well that&#39;s analogous to what Freud would call a complex, right?</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.910" end="00:33:54.959" style="s2">Is that this because you could imagine what&#39;s happened is that the boss&#39;s words have brought up a whole little sub personality</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:56.890" style="s2">predicated on doubt</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.890" end="00:33:59.849" style="s2">Up to the surface and who knows how deep that would be?</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.850" end="00:34:03.750" style="s2">Well what happens if I lose my job and if I lose my job, well, what sort of person am I?</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.270" end="00:34:09.810" style="s2">Exactly. And what about all these other times that I&#39;ve failed and then maybe you remember the other times that you failed and what am</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.810" end="00:34:15.719" style="s2">I going to do in the future. So it&#39;s this whole cluster of ideas that surrounds that doubt and that&#39;s been activated</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.720" end="00:34:20.189" style="s2">It&#39;s a little part of you and then maybe you&#39;re not attending to that because you&#39;re busy doing some other work</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.190" end="00:34:24.090" style="s2">But when you go home something triggers it and like it&#39;s already there</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.090" end="00:34:29.399" style="s2">It&#39;s all you get way more upset than you should and that&#39;s that&#39;s what a complex is except in a much more</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.950" end="00:34:34.050" style="s2">complicated manner like a complex might be a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:39.810" style="s2">experiences that you&#39;ve had that are united by some emotion like threat</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.360" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">That aren&#39;t haven&#39;t been transformed into a coherent representation</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.440" end="00:34:49.860" style="s2">But that can rise out of the unconscious and possess you if you guys many of you guys have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:56.669" style="s2">Depressed at at least one point in your life, you know, it&#39;s actually very common for University of Toronto students</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.730" end="00:34:59.730" style="s2">especially in their first year</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.040" end="00:35:04.229" style="s2">It&#39;s about one in three if you if you have students the Beck Depression Inventory</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.630" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">But one in three taught University of Toronto students in our research have have hit criteria for hospitalization</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:16.199" style="s2">I mean the back is a little oversensitive as far as I&#39;m concerned, but but you know what? It&#39;s like when you&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.200" end="00:35:23.639" style="s2">It&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a part of your personality sort of subsumes the whole and depression quite classically is well</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.640" end="00:35:28.410" style="s2">You can&#39;t think of anything good that happened to you in the past and you can&#39;t think of any reason why the present is good</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.410" end="00:35:33.450" style="s2">For anything and you&#39;re pretty damn hopeless about the future and so that&#39;s a complex as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.450" end="00:35:38.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s a complex that consists of nothing but negative emotion and it structures your</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.350" end="00:35:42.209" style="s2">Memory and your percept and your plans for the future all at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.759" end="00:35:44.349" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.349" end="00:35:50.818" style="s2">Freud had a very lengthy list of ways that people could be treacherous towards</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.519" end="00:35:56.279" style="s2">Experiences they had that they wanted to repress and so he called them defense mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.279" end="00:36:04.049" style="s2">This is how you fool yourself into believing that you don&#39;t have to take into account a certain set of negative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.569" end="00:36:06.279" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.279" end="00:36:13.859" style="s2">Well, we&#39;ll go through the repression. Okay. Well we talked about that denial. Well that often denial is a very complicated one</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.789" end="00:36:20.789" style="s2">See if I can come up with a good example</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.809" end="00:36:28.768" style="s2">It was a classic example for people who have I think it&#39;s called anis Ignasi, I don&#39;t remember exactly it&#39;s neglect</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.109" end="00:36:32.338" style="s2">That&#39;s a less technical way of thinking about so let&#39;s say you have a right parietal</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.619" end="00:36:39.268" style="s2">Damage from a stroke and you lose the left side of your body so you can&#39;t move it anymore, but worse you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.269" end="00:36:41.429" style="s2">It&#39;s there and you don&#39;t know that the left side of anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.430" end="00:36:47.399" style="s2">Is there anymore and god only knows how that happens but like you&#39;ll only eat half the food on your plate only on the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.400" end="00:36:53.039" style="s2">hand side and if someone asks you to draw a clock you&#39;ll cram all the numbers into the one side and so you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.039" end="00:36:57.778" style="s2">Lose the idea of left and I think it&#39;s sort of like, you know how when you&#39;re looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.779" end="00:37:03.479" style="s2">There&#39;s nothing behind you. You can&#39;t see anything back here. It&#39;s it&#39;s not black. It&#39;s not even gone</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.609" end="00:37:09.238" style="s2">It&#39;s just simply not there at all. And so if you could imagine that sort of stretching around halfway</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.819" end="00:37:16.649" style="s2">That seems to be something what neglect is like, but anyways, if you if you take someone with neglect according to Ramachandra</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.650" end="00:37:19.829" style="s2">and then if you irrigate their ear with cold water the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.410" end="00:37:25.410" style="s2">Ear on the opposite side, then they&#39;ll kind of have a little convulsion and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.319" end="00:37:29.278" style="s2">They become aware of their missing left side</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.349" end="00:37:32.849" style="s2">If you talk to them before you do the irrigation, you say well well</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.849" end="00:37:34.849" style="s2">what&#39;s up with your left arm and they&#39;ll say well I</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.079" end="00:37:38.998" style="s2">My arthritis is bothering me and I don&#39;t want to move it they come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.880" end="00:37:42.509" style="s2">Something that sounds akin to denial, you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.509" end="00:37:46.379" style="s2">And then if you can snap them out of that with that irrigation and they&#39;ll have a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.019" end="00:37:48.759" style="s2">emotional response</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.759" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">logically enough to the loss of their entire left side and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.359" end="00:37:57.629" style="s2">Ramachandran report that lasting about 20 minutes and then they&#39;ll snap out of it and go right back into the denial and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.210" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2">sometimes people deny things because</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.150" end="00:38:04.980" style="s2">They can&#39;t update what&#39;s happened to them is so overwhelming that they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:09.989" style="s2">Construct a new model. They just rely on the old one and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.840" end="00:38:14.039" style="s2">Well, imagine first that you&#39;ve just had a tooth pulled and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.040" end="00:38:17.550" style="s2">How many how long your tongue takes to like remap the inside of your mouth?</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.550" end="00:38:24.629" style="s2">It&#39;s really hard to come up with a new concept of you if something catastrophic happens, and so sometimes the denial is just that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.330" end="00:38:29.039" style="s2">Something the thing that has happened is so overwhelming that the person can&#39;t model it</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.040" end="00:38:33.509" style="s2">But then maybe also they refuse to think about it and you see this</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.030" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">emerging in lots of strange ways</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:39.060" style="s2">so for example, if people develop diabetes, for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.100" end="00:38:44.789" style="s2">They&#39;re often not very good at taking their medication or regulating their diet and you might say well they&#39;re denying the existence</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.920" end="00:38:46.950" style="s2">of their illness and to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.950" end="00:38:51.870" style="s2">They&#39;re probably doing that because who the hell wants to think that they&#39;re diabetic but even worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.870" end="00:38:54.120" style="s2">It&#39;s like it&#39;s complicated to be diabetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.120" end="00:38:59.879" style="s2">You&#39;re no longer the same person that you were and so you have to learn a whole bunch of new ways to be this new</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:03.270" style="s2">Person what to eat when to eat how to check your blood</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:06.780" style="s2">you have to be careful whenever you go out and eat like there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.210" end="00:39:12.689" style="s2">Hundred new things a day that you have to learn and so separating denial from inability is a hard one</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.690" end="00:39:19.080" style="s2">But you can also understand that people might deny. No, that&#39;s just not happening. That&#39;s that&#39;s I&#39;m not going to admit to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.020" end="00:39:26.459" style="s2">Reaction formation. Oh, that&#39;s one. Maybe you hate your sister and maybe you have your reasons, but you shouldn&#39;t hate your sister</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.460" end="00:39:31.439" style="s2">So what you do is act as if you really really like her. That&#39;s an overcompensation</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.720" end="00:39:34.709" style="s2">So that&#39;s another form of defense mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.350" end="00:39:36.610" style="s2">displacement</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.610" end="00:39:41.639" style="s2">My boss yells at me. I yell at my husband. My husband yells at the baby the baby bites the cat</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.980" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">Well, they&#39;re not really dealing with the problem, which is the boss. It&#39;s just pushed on down the road and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.580" end="00:39:55.709" style="s2">Identification you&#39;re bullied and instead of coming to terms with the fact that bullying occurs. You start bullying other people</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.060" end="00:40:01.889" style="s2">Rationalization, well, you know what that means already, you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.990" end="00:40:07.020" style="s2">Maybe you don&#39;t do your homework you&#39;re procrastinating. I bet you can come up with fifteen rauch</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.450" end="00:40:12.270" style="s2">No problem for why it&#39;s actually not necessary for you to do your homework right then</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.600" end="00:40:20.219" style="s2">Intellectualization what Woody Allen&#39;s movies are about like that. He&#39;s got all these neurotic problems, but he&#39;s smart and so he can come up with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.100" end="00:40:25.769" style="s2">Intelligent reasons why he&#39;s so messed up even though he knows he&#39;s messed up and it doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.590" end="00:40:27.700" style="s2">sublimation</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.700" end="00:40:32.070" style="s2">Well that that was one of the things that Freud thought characterized art</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.070" end="00:40:34.709" style="s2">So for example, there&#39;s a lot of erotic content in art</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.710" end="00:40:34.990" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.990" end="00:40:37.409" style="s2">so if you&#39;re having trouble establishing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:43.320" style="s2">relationship or if you want to have a relationship with many people then maybe what you do is sculpt nudes or paint them and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.390" end="00:40:45.390" style="s2">there&#39;s projection which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.060" end="00:40:53.100" style="s2">I&#39;m having an argument with you and I&#39;m unwilling to admit to my moat my dark motivations, and I&#39;m very skeptical of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.100" end="00:40:58.169" style="s2">And so I assume that you&#39;re characterized by all the dark motivations that I won&#39;t admit to in myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.780" end="00:41:00.780" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.560" end="00:41:08.369" style="s2">Now Freud also believed that it was unconscious ideas that were at the core of psychological conflicts and he</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.710" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">Described those conflicts as incomprehensible distress</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.430" end="00:41:15.510" style="s2">psychosomatic symptoms and so those would be the manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.840" end="00:41:18.790" style="s2">psychological of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.790" end="00:41:26.699" style="s2">The manifestation of psychological content in bodily form that might be stress a stress-related illness might be one way of thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.250" end="00:41:32.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve had clients who had hysterical epilepsy. So that was quite interesting. So that was a somatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.369" end="00:41:35.369" style="s2">manifestation of a psychological problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.460" end="00:41:38.460" style="s2">back when Freud was</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.460" end="00:41:40.570" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.570" end="00:41:42.119" style="s2">Hysteria was much more common</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.119" end="00:41:45.059" style="s2">and maybe that was partly because Victorian society was so</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.550" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">Centred on the theater and so dramatic and people would come in with like a paralyzed arm or something like that that he could</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.700" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">Sort out with hypnosis, and so they were manifesting their</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.810" end="00:42:01.499" style="s2">Psychological distress in bodily form often in a manner that was representative of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.920" end="00:42:04.920" style="s2">psychological conflict in some way</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:09.990" style="s2">Behavioral anomalies hallucinations and delusions. He thought that all of those could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:13.000" style="s2">manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.000" end="00:42:18.540" style="s2">inner internal psychological conflict with their sets of unconscious ideas, so</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.060" end="00:42:22.499" style="s2">You know, let&#39;s go back to the - the boss example</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.049" end="00:42:25.439" style="s2">Your boss says something nasty to you. Come home</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.200" end="00:42:27.609" style="s2">Someone says something a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.609" end="00:42:32.969" style="s2">Provoking and you fly off the handle and then you have an argument about what the hell is up with you because they say well</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.970" end="00:42:37.740" style="s2">Look what I said was, you know this big and you reacted like this and you&#39;re gonna say, well no</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.740" end="00:42:39.990" style="s2">No, you&#39;re always annoying like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.990" end="00:42:45.240" style="s2">And which is kind of a denial thing and maybe the person doesn&#39;t let up and they say no</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.240" end="00:42:46.650" style="s2">No, I really know that something&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.650" end="00:42:51.089" style="s2">And you do like six other things to keep them the hell away from you and finally they&#39;re persistent enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.089" end="00:42:56.548" style="s2">so you break down crying and you say well I had this terrible day at work and you didn&#39;t even really notice that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.799" end="00:43:04.288" style="s2">knew that until the moment of the moment of the tears and you see that very frequently in psychotherapy - if you&#39;re talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:05.880" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.880" end="00:43:10.980" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;re relating a story about their their marriage that collapse badly and they&#39;re talking and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.289" end="00:43:13.349" style="s2">they&#39;ll say something and they&#39;ll tear up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.569" end="00:43:17.609" style="s2">Then they&#39;ll continue and you can grab that you say look you just said something</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.609" end="00:43:22.528" style="s2">I noticed that your eyes filled with tears when you said that what was going through your mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.930" end="00:43:26.549" style="s2">Now often they&#39;ll they unless you catch it quick they&#39;ll forget</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.890" end="00:43:31.980" style="s2">So they&#39;re talking and they&#39;ll have and the talking about the past is you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.200" end="00:43:36.179" style="s2">flashing off imagistic memories and you&#39;ll say well that made you cry and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:41.249" style="s2">And they often don&#39;t like that because for obvious reasons that something&#39;s come up that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.529" end="00:43:43.299" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.299" end="00:43:48.179" style="s2">So you say well what was flashing through your mind and the person will tell you like quite a lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.700" end="00:43:53.429" style="s2">little memory fantasy about a sequence of events that you know is still a</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.799" end="00:43:58.949" style="s2">Hot-button issue and that&#39;s another example of this underlying complex, you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.950" end="00:44:00.759" style="s2">and if you watch people</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.759" end="00:44:02.879" style="s2">You can watch people in normal conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.880" end="00:44:06.869" style="s2">this happens all the times their eyes will move or they&#39;ll smile or you can see as</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.999" end="00:44:10.409" style="s2">They&#39;re speaking that all sorts of different ideas are flitting through their head</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.619" end="00:44:16.288" style="s2">It&#39;s dreamlike in a sense - it&#39;s sort of as if the person is talking and they&#39;re dreaming at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.359" end="00:44:21.568" style="s2">There&#39;s this image Laden set of memories that&#39;s going on at the same time and that can be quite broad</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.819" end="00:44:24.808" style="s2">far broader than they could encapsulate in the words and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.999" end="00:44:31.379" style="s2">so you can catch that and if you&#39;re really listening to someone really paying attention to them you can see when they&#39;re doubtful or when</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.380" end="00:44:33.599" style="s2">They pause for a long time. That&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.759" end="00:44:39.779" style="s2">You know that some things come up that that that&#39;s occupying their mind and interfering with the flow of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.500" end="00:44:42.689" style="s2">Freud was very good at listening in that manner</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.410" end="00:44:47.039" style="s2">While that happens with jokes too, you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:51.419" style="s2">Like for example when I was showing you guys the Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.090" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">Stills the other day and I showed you that picture of nella laying on her back with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.860" end="00:45:00.299" style="s2">peculiar expression on her face everybody immediately laughed and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.700" end="00:45:04.410" style="s2">the you be Freud would have considered that an entry point into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.600" end="00:45:08.189" style="s2">Unconscious because there is a reason you were laughing about it. It goes along with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.190" end="00:45:08.430" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.430" end="00:45:14.790" style="s2">it would have gone along with a sexual complex in that situation and everybody recognizes it instantly and they laugh about it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.160" end="00:45:18.239" style="s2">Comedians are really good at that because if they&#39;re good comedians</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.280" end="00:45:23.340" style="s2">They say what everyone&#39;s thinking but no one will say and it&#39;s a relief to everyone. You know, he</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:25.950" style="s2">What&#39;s his name?</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.570" end="00:45:35.160" style="s2">Canadian comedian so he&#39;s making racial jokes. No. No, it&#39;s Canadian. Uh, yeah Russell Russell Peters</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.160" end="00:45:36.990" style="s2">I mean, he&#39;s a great example of that, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.990" end="00:45:42.660" style="s2">He feels a whole stadium with people of all different ethnicities and every single one of them is dying to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:45.209" style="s2">Insulted because of their racial background, you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.210" end="00:45:46.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a relief to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.270" end="00:45:51.239" style="s2">everyone so he had salts the herbs and then he insults the Jews and then he insults the Christians and he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.240" end="00:45:53.250" style="s2">Oh, I&#39;m so glad finally someone said that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:46:01.890" style="s2">No, so so he&#39;s speaking to part of their unconscious and it&#39;s the part that&#39;s actually uncomfortable with all of that kind of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.930" end="00:46:04.290" style="s2">Being repressed and staying below the surface</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.290" end="00:46:10.229" style="s2">It&#39;s way too weighty for people so jokes expressed in playful language what culture will not?</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.690" end="00:46:12.270" style="s2">formally express so</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.270" end="00:46:16.020" style="s2">You know to that when the culture starts going after the comedian&#39;s that things are not good</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.090" end="00:46:18.150" style="s2">So you should leave the damn comedians alone</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.370" end="00:46:22.589" style="s2">Because there are the people that can tell the truth and if you start to get annoyed at them, then that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.260" end="00:46:25.260" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.940" end="00:46:30.899" style="s2">So a Freud was also extraordinarily interested in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.430" end="00:46:38.700" style="s2">Poor Freud who were just not gonna be able to cover him in enough detail. Well, um,</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.660" end="00:46:43.649" style="s2">How will we do this because I should tell you about the dreams</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.420" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">Freud wrote a book called the interpretation of dreams and he he was the first person I would say who</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.359" end="00:46:56.129" style="s2">subjected dreams to a really comprehensive analysis and he used them to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.329" end="00:47:05.129" style="s2">Investigate the place of complexes in his psychotherapeutic practice. So his clients would recount their dreams to him now</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.130" end="00:47:11.430" style="s2">He believed that dreams always expressed an unconscious wish and that was tied into his theory of repression</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.430" end="00:47:15.059" style="s2">And so for example if you were very very sexually repressed</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.059" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">which was very common at the time then you&#39;d have dreams with sexual content that we&#39;re expressing the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:24.249" style="s2">expressing the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.249" end="00:47:31.709" style="s2">Undesirable fantasy essentially and by analyzing the dream you could get down to what you could get down to what was being repressed</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:34.829" style="s2">now Freud believed that the dream</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.319" end="00:47:37.319" style="s2">more or less tied itself in knots</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.470" end="00:47:38.650" style="s2">trying to hide its</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.650" end="00:47:45.059" style="s2">Content in some sense and Jung believed instead that the dream was actually trying to be as clear as it could it just wasn&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.059" end="00:47:47.788" style="s2">Of the let&#39;s call it the semantic memory system</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.789" end="00:47:50.248" style="s2">It was it was more like a feeler out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.289" end="00:47:51.970" style="s2">it was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.970" end="00:47:58.259" style="s2">Represent things as clearly as it could and so its use of symbols and that sort of thing wasn&#39;t so much to hide the actual</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.660" end="00:48:05.190" style="s2">Unpleasant content from the dreamer but to express it in the only language that the dream could use and so Freud</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.190" end="00:48:08.039" style="s2">Of course also believed that some of that was true</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.680" end="00:48:11.519" style="s2">All right. Well, we&#39;re gonna have to stop there. So</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.339" end="00:48:14.518" style="s2">since it&#39;s 2 o&#39;clock, so we&#39;ll see you on</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.609" end="00:48:17.609" style="s2">Tuesday</p>
