<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">in to is people know who listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">podcast regularly in a current episode</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">we typically start with one item in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">news or tweet somebody made or in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">case a radio appearance Jim made on CBC</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">radio where he said if the isolation and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:56.360" style="s2">I&#39;m presuming that&#39;s the isolation in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">fact I know from the koban nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.360" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">pandemic drags on Jim worries we might</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">be headed for a social recession so over</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">to you Jim tell us what you meant by</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:11.270" style="s2">social recession and and this radio</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.670" style="s2">quote was back around the first to April</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.270" end="00:02:15.319" style="s2">what is in what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.670" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">inspired since that make you think</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.319" end="00:02:22.010" style="s2">differently or the same or more compared</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">to where you were back in April well you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.010" end="00:02:26.200" style="s2">know the social recession is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">analogous or may even metaphorical but</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.200" end="00:02:30.850" style="s2">but if you think about a financial</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.790" end="00:02:34.280" style="s2">recession you&#39;re really thinking about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.850" end="00:02:37.220" style="s2">widespread decrease in access to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.280" end="00:02:41.300" style="s2">financial resources for a period of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.220" end="00:02:41.989" style="s2">for whatever reason and what I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.300" end="00:02:45.140" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.989" end="00:02:48.680" style="s2">when I say social recession is is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.140" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">widespread decrease in access to social</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.680" end="00:02:54.140" style="s2">resources and that concerns me because</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">social resources are the the human</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.140" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">body&#39;s are you know original currency</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:03.560" style="s2">that makes sense how can we think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">you know what I&#39;ve read about early</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.560" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">stage people&#39;s foragers etc you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:10.459" style="s2">they&#39;re essentially their life was</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:12.680" style="s2">social interactions and in fact one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.459" end="00:03:14.120" style="s2">my favorite theories about the origins</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.680" end="00:03:16.370" style="s2">of language may or may not be true</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.120" end="00:03:18.890" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of competing theories is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.370" end="00:03:20.570" style="s2">that one of the driving forces for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.890" end="00:03:23.030" style="s2">evolution of language may well have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.570" end="00:03:25.130" style="s2">gossip right keeping track of social</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.030" end="00:03:28.209" style="s2">status amongst you know a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.130" end="00:03:29.540" style="s2">somewhere between 20 and 150 foragers oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.540" end="00:03:35.269" style="s2">I mean but but it goes deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.840" end="00:03:38.510" style="s2">so there there are specific functions to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.269" end="00:03:41.959" style="s2">specific kinds of communication all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.510" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">way from gossiping at the higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.959" end="00:03:46.870" style="s2">down to finger-pointing at the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:50.030" style="s2">lower levels and perhaps more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.870" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">pleasee amorphic or all evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.030" end="00:03:58.670" style="s2">old levels but what really concerns me</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:04:02.150" style="s2">is that when you look at the prevailing</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.670" end="00:04:06.470" style="s2">theories any of let&#39;s say half a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.150" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">of them you find that most people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.470" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">the consensus is sort of pointing us</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">toward an idea that humans are not bound</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:17.859" style="s2">to a Pacific terrestrial environment</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">the way that many so many species are</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.859" end="00:04:25.789" style="s2">that we have in fact perhaps due to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:26.420" style="s2">pronounced climate variability in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.789" end="00:04:30.550" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.420" end="00:04:35.510" style="s2">evolutionary development developed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.550" end="00:04:38.090" style="s2">sort of predominant adaptations one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.510" end="00:04:39.800" style="s2">them is that we&#39;ve transcended a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.090" end="00:04:43.850" style="s2">specific terrestrial environment in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.800" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">favor of any environment like literally</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.850" end="00:04:46.130" style="s2">any environment that includes other</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:48.920" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.130" end="00:04:53.540" style="s2">so other humans are the ecological niche</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.920" end="00:04:55.940" style="s2">that we have adopted as a species in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.540" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">process some think like Richard Wrangham</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.940" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">and Brian hare and others includes a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:05.290" style="s2">kind of a self domestication like we</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:08.570" style="s2">domesticated ourselves in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.290" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">become hyper cooperative hyper tolerant</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.570" end="00:05:15.170" style="s2">of each other around food sources and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.210" end="00:05:17.800" style="s2">other resource sources and not so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.170" end="00:05:21.350" style="s2">dependent upon a specific kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.800" end="00:05:23.720" style="s2">geography or flora or fauna the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.350" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2">thing that this is resulted in is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.720" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">of restlessness so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:32.090" style="s2">that we populated the globe so rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:33.710" style="s2">is that once we developed this once we</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.090" end="00:05:36.530" style="s2">transcended specific terrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.710" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">environments during periods of relative</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.530" end="00:05:40.280" style="s2">climate stability we are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:41.960" style="s2">standing around tapping our foot going</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.280" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">where&#39;s the change where&#39;s the change so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.960" end="00:05:47.570" style="s2">we made the change ourselves by moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.970" style="s2">our bodies into new places the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.570" end="00:05:52.850" style="s2">line is that our brains and indeed our</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.970" end="00:05:56.900" style="s2">bodies right down to the sclera the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.850" end="00:06:01.330" style="s2">whites of our eyes are functionally</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.900" end="00:06:03.650" style="s2">adapted to the presence of other humans</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.330" end="00:06:05.480" style="s2">they&#39;re designed for the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.650" end="00:06:08.060" style="s2">other humans and they don&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.480" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">if other humans aren&#39;t around they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.060" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not useful in any sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter whether we have sclera</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:20.690" style="s2">around our pupils if there are no other</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.570" style="s2">people around to pay attention to where</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.690" end="00:06:25.460" style="s2">our pupils are looking it doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.570" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">us with the the terrestrial environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.460" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">in any way so we are arguing we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:39.060" style="s2">argued that evolutionarily our brains in</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">our bodies emerge</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.060" end="00:06:49.350" style="s2">you know from the void expecting this</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:52.140" style="s2">this environment of other humans and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.350" end="00:06:56.690" style="s2">that one of the one of the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.140" end="00:06:59.630" style="s2">of not finding it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.690" end="00:07:02.840" style="s2">automatically mount a stress response</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.630" end="00:07:05.730" style="s2">just the same way that a you know that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.840" end="00:07:09.390" style="s2">salamander might mount a stress response</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.730" end="00:07:12.510" style="s2">if it finds itself in a hot dry climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.390" end="00:07:14.490" style="s2">suddenly because it wants a cold damp</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.510" end="00:07:16.350" style="s2">climate and it&#39;ll turn right over that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.490" end="00:07:18.540" style="s2">the whole purpose of the stress response</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.350" end="00:07:23.130" style="s2">is to get it back to where it&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.540" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">to be so we know that humans evolved in</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.130" end="00:07:27.000" style="s2">a social contacts in fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:29.700" style="s2">who listen the show often know that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.000" end="00:07:32.340" style="s2">will say that cooperation is the human</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.700" end="00:07:34.050" style="s2">superpower yeah that allows us to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.340" end="00:07:36.120" style="s2">penetrated the world and then we&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:38.550" style="s2">well we&#39;re close to chimps but chimps</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.120" end="00:07:40.410" style="s2">don&#39;t cooperate anywhere near like</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.550" end="00:07:41.910" style="s2">humans are close there was something</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.410" end="00:07:43.710" style="s2">probably around the development of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.910" end="00:07:45.960" style="s2">language and other things allowed us to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.710" end="00:07:48.360" style="s2">cooperate way more and as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.960" end="00:07:50.840" style="s2">we have physical mechanisms like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.360" end="00:07:54.990" style="s2">whites of the eyes and many many others</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.840" end="00:07:57.810" style="s2">that show that we are deeply social so</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.990" end="00:07:59.730" style="s2">presumably your argument about social</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.810" end="00:08:01.290" style="s2">recession has something to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.730" end="00:08:04.140" style="s2">happens when the number of social</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.290" end="00:08:07.980" style="s2">interactions declines maybe you could go</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.140" end="00:08:11.250" style="s2">with that yeah well it but so that gets</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.980" end="00:08:13.170" style="s2">us to sort of proximal mechanisms of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.250" end="00:08:15.900" style="s2">we cooperate and this is where things</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.170" end="00:08:19.590" style="s2">get really really weird this is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.900" end="00:08:21.420" style="s2">things get almost science fictiony for</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.590" end="00:08:22.260" style="s2">you and perhaps your listeners and for</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.420" end="00:08:25.200" style="s2">me for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.260" end="00:08:27.860" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t necessarily expect what</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.200" end="00:08:32.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve wound up finding with these</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.860" end="00:08:35.880" style="s2">studies of you know how do you take</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.690" end="00:08:37.920" style="s2">social support proximity to a potential</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.880" end="00:08:40.470" style="s2">cooperative partner and transform that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.920" end="00:08:42.180" style="s2">into better health and well-being there</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.470" end="00:08:43.530" style="s2">are results have surprised us and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:45.570" style="s2">gonna explain them to you right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.530" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">instead of just going on with this dark</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.570" end="00:08:52.200" style="s2">and stormy night introduction the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:56.280" style="s2">is we&#39;re not just autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.200" end="00:09:00.090" style="s2">units deciding to cooperate in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.280" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">additive fashion when humans cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.090" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">we create synergistic effects emergent</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:11.400" style="s2">properties that transcend the the sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:16.740" style="s2">of additive contributions of our mutual</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.400" end="00:09:19.110" style="s2">cooperation and that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.740" end="00:09:21.930" style="s2">because it means that cooperating with</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.110" end="00:09:24.870" style="s2">in the with another human in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.930" end="00:09:28.440" style="s2">labor creates multiplicative effects we</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.870" end="00:09:31.890" style="s2">actually we actually create exponential</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.440" end="00:09:36.180" style="s2">gains economies of scale we say in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.890" end="00:09:37.950" style="s2">right and in our labs parlance not only</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.180" end="00:09:41.730" style="s2">economies of scale in terms of building</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.950" end="00:09:43.860" style="s2">model T&#39;s but in terms of hunting you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.730" end="00:09:47.430" style="s2">know woolly mammoths and in terms D</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.860" end="00:09:49.320" style="s2">indeed of thinking remembering even our</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.430" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">own biographies we create economies of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.320" end="00:09:59.250" style="s2">scale by plugging into social networks</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:10:02.250" style="s2">at the conceptual level this is super</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.250" end="00:10:05.150" style="s2">interesting because it suggests that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.250" end="00:10:09.180" style="s2">are capable of sort of connecting up</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.150" end="00:10:11.850" style="s2">into units that are qualitatively</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.180" end="00:10:17.280" style="s2">different than the individual so group</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.850" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">level units right we create groups that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.280" end="00:10:24.330" style="s2">have a group --is-- ness to them that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:28.020" style="s2">not easily reducible to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.330" end="00:10:32.010" style="s2">units within the group that suggests in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.020" end="00:10:34.590" style="s2">turn that we are it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.010" end="00:10:38.900" style="s2">that cooperation is our super power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.590" end="00:10:44.280" style="s2">that cooperation is our lifeblood</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.900" end="00:10:47.390" style="s2">cooperation is our hope for survival we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.280" end="00:10:52.770" style="s2">are dependent on cooperation not merely</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.390" end="00:10:54.840" style="s2">capable of it and so again you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.770" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">well what&#39;s the evidence for that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.840" end="00:11:02.760" style="s2">gets into some really strange territory</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.790" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">I&#39;ve just said that you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.760" end="00:11:06.150" style="s2">know we create these sort of synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:08.580" style="s2">or emergent properties when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.150" end="00:11:11.490" style="s2">we&#39;re inhabiting our groups what is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.580" end="00:11:14.280" style="s2">result in well as any good behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.490" end="00:11:17.880" style="s2">ecologist will know any critter on earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.280" end="00:11:19.350" style="s2">and humans or critters pardon me I hope</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.880" end="00:11:24.090" style="s2">that&#39;s not offensive to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.350" end="00:11:27.060" style="s2">humans are critters who have to manage</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.090" end="00:11:28.980" style="s2">resources right so we when we are making</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.060" end="00:11:30.780" style="s2">a decision about whether to cooperate or</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.980" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">not or whether to walk up a hill</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.780" end="00:11:38.010" style="s2">for example we are simultaneously making</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.320" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">a decision to invest metabolic resources</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.010" end="00:11:44.010" style="s2">in that activity and if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">invest there better be some payoff and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.010" end="00:11:48.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not always obvious what that payoff</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">is but these are the calculations that</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.030" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">we&#39;re making all the time and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">out just at the behavioral or perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">level that if let&#39;s go back to the hill</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:12:01.700" style="s2">if I&#39;m standing looking at a hill I see</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:05.730" style="s2">that hill as steeper than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.700" end="00:12:06.510" style="s2">now that&#39;s why land by myself and why do</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.730" end="00:12:08.400" style="s2">I do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.510" end="00:12:11.790" style="s2">because and this is these are all</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.400" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">empirical findings by the way I do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.790" end="00:12:16.490" style="s2">because my brain is not so subtly trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">to talk me out of walking up the hill</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.490" end="00:12:22.740" style="s2">because all else being equal it costs</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:24.540" style="s2">less in terms of bioenergetic resources</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.740" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">to walk up the hill and do not walk up</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.540" end="00:12:30.920" style="s2">the hill right so I see it as steep in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:33.330" style="s2">proportion to how much motivation I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.920" end="00:12:37.530" style="s2">to seek whatever is at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.330" end="00:12:39.450" style="s2">hill now I put a heavy backpack on you</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.530" end="00:12:42.120" style="s2">about 20% of your body weight and guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.450" end="00:12:45.030" style="s2">what I find the hill becomes even</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.120" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">steeper in your perception you see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.030" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">hill as steeper with the heavy backpack</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:51.890" style="s2">on then you do without it and you see it</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.800" end="00:12:57.810" style="s2">is steeper than it actually is</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.890" end="00:13:00.090" style="s2">even that at a baseline state now</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.810" end="00:13:01.710" style="s2">keeping that heavy backpack on oh by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.090" end="00:13:03.330" style="s2">way and we do this again I want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.710" end="00:13:06.450" style="s2">remind everyone because the big reveals</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.330" end="00:13:09.410" style="s2">coming up that this is about your brains</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.450" end="00:13:11.850" style="s2">management predictive regulation as</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.759" end="00:13:39.779" style="s2">the hill as steeper and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.619" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna require something even</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.779" end="00:13:42.619" style="s2">greater at the top of the hill before</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:45.949" style="s2">you&#39;re going to invest all that</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.869" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">steep now we&#39;ve just framed this whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">perceptual finding in terms of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:32.279" end="00:14:39.529" style="s2">that most of the time well this is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.619" end="00:14:43.919" style="s2">we have to talk about how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.529" end="00:14:46.589" style="s2">creates a model of the self and what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.919" end="00:14:48.709" style="s2">self is and this is some neuro</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.589" end="00:14:51.799" style="s2">scientific work that I published back in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.709" end="00:14:53.639" style="s2">initially back in 2013 we have a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.799" end="00:14:55.079" style="s2">replication coming out with a much</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.639" end="00:14:58.709" style="s2">larger more robust and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.079" end="00:15:02.519" style="s2">representative sample but what we did is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.709" end="00:15:04.860" style="s2">we looked at sort of how the brain made</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.519" end="00:15:07.889" style="s2">a model of the self when it was under</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.860" end="00:15:10.829" style="s2">threat threat of mild electric shock and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.889" end="00:15:13.709" style="s2">how the brain made a model written sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.829" end="00:15:15.179" style="s2">of responded when we put a friend under</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.709" end="00:15:16.859" style="s2">threat of shock and then how the brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.179" end="00:15:18.329" style="s2">responded when we put a stranger under</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.859" end="00:15:22.889" style="s2">threat of shock and what we found is</p>

<p begin="00:18:50.900" end="00:18:57.920" style="s2">that&#39;s because we have figured out when</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.190" end="00:19:15.830" style="s2">have to pay more for whatever we do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.510" end="00:19:18.470" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting makes a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.830" end="00:19:20.420" style="s2">that when I think about it if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.470" end="00:19:23.450" style="s2">evolved as we certainly have in this</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.450" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">really an extended part of our self and</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:33.980" style="s2">have those resources it sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.790" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">can happen it does happen unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.980" end="00:19:39.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just our perception of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:41.990" style="s2">situated instead of being able to apply</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.990" end="00:19:46.910" style="s2">housekeeping etc it makes sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.080" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">into something like a vigilance mode</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.910" end="00:19:51.830" style="s2">Here I am you know away from my troupe</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:54.470" style="s2">of fellow Apes and something is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.830" end="00:19:57.410" style="s2">something is up this is not business as</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.470" end="00:19:59.060" style="s2">usual and it would you know make sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.410" end="00:20:01.850" style="s2">they actually have a separate State for</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.060" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">that kind of situation is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.850" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">sort of a reasonable way of framing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:07.880" style="s2">I think so</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">I&#39;m but I would want to keep it focused</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.880" end="00:20:13.430" style="s2">as much as we can on the management of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:16.520" style="s2">bioenergetic resources because this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.430" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">really key what you find when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.520" end="00:20:21.110" style="s2">alone what your brain finds and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:23.420" style="s2">often implicit as you suggest that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.110" end="00:20:26.930" style="s2">it&#39;s often outside of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.420" end="00:20:31.270" style="s2">awareness your brain just budgets your</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.930" end="00:20:36.140" style="s2">body&#39;s resources differently right so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.270" end="00:20:38.060" style="s2">assumes access to fewer resources when</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.140" end="00:20:41.810" style="s2">you&#39;re by yourself and that means you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.060" end="00:20:43.700" style="s2">have to decide differently about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.810" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">what kind of behaviors to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.700" end="00:20:48.980" style="s2">because all behavior is costly right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:51.560" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna go you know up that hill</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.980" end="00:20:54.650" style="s2">that steep hill with that heavy backpack</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.560" end="00:20:56.540" style="s2">on if you had your friend with you well</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.650" end="00:20:57.980" style="s2">then maybe there&#39;s a there&#39;s a cupcake</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.540" end="00:20:59.570" style="s2">at the top and that&#39;s sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.980" end="00:21:01.040" style="s2">motivation to go up to the top because</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.570" end="00:21:03.290" style="s2">you&#39;re friends with you you&#39;ve got extra</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.040" end="00:21:05.540" style="s2">extra energy but if your friends not</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.290" end="00:21:08.090" style="s2">with you you&#39;re gonna need like 12</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.540" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">cupcakes at the top to motivate you to</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.090" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">walk up that hill okay right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:16.450" style="s2">one thing but the other thing is if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:19.190" style="s2">look at it from the other perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.450" end="00:21:21.680" style="s2">chances are the number of cupcakes on</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.190" end="00:21:22.940" style="s2">the top of the hill hasn&#39;t changed so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.680" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">what does that mean you&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:29.270" style="s2">going to go up that hill so let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:31.820" style="s2">out of metaphor zone and back into real</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.270" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">life what does that look like that looks</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.820" end="00:21:38.260" style="s2">like lion bed lying around the house not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:43.750" style="s2">going out that looks like depression in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.260" end="00:21:47.990" style="s2">fact that is depression when you start</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.750" end="00:21:50.210" style="s2">going through long periods of adjusting</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.990" end="00:21:53.800" style="s2">to a world in which you have fewer</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.800" end="00:21:58.370" style="s2">looks like the proverbial steeper Hill</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.100" end="00:23:44.510" style="s2">depressed in fact maybe that is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.960" end="00:23:47.720" style="s2">being depressed is is that pretty close</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.510" end="00:23:50.090" style="s2">to the story and in two sentences that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.720" end="00:23:52.610" style="s2">the story that&#39;s the basic story okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.090" end="00:23:54.860" style="s2">so will either will either be depressed</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.610" end="00:23:56.390" style="s2">and lie around and try not to spend</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.860" end="00:23:58.370" style="s2">those metabolic resources so we can</p>

<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:46.390" style="s2">this is this is why people under chronic</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.890" end="00:24:58.930" style="s2">because you have an interest in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.630" end="00:25:03.940" style="s2">area I know but the more socially</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.930" end="00:25:07.810" style="s2">isolated you are the more likely you are</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.310" end="00:25:15.700" style="s2">you inhabit it is the most deadly thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.030" end="00:25:17.560" style="s2">that can happen to you just about except</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.700" end="00:25:21.570" style="s2">for maybe a boulder falling on your head</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.560" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a very bad thing to be suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.570" end="00:25:29.920" style="s2">isolated with a little asterisk and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:31.900" style="s2">asterisk is involuntarily there&#39;s few</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.920" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">there are a few things more wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.900" end="00:25:37.090" style="s2">and soothing and beautiful than</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.580" end="00:25:40.030" style="s2">voluntary isolation when you have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.090" end="00:25:42.430" style="s2">option to go and reconnect with your</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.030" end="00:25:44.110" style="s2">social group whenever you want then</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.430" end="00:25:47.230" style="s2">because social groups are also an</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.110" end="00:25:48.550" style="s2">investment and then you can you can rest</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:51.570" style="s2">from that investment but when but when</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.550" end="00:25:54.310" style="s2">it&#39;s involuntary you are you are screwed</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.570" end="00:25:57.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we&#39;re at for sure right</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.310" end="00:26:01.240" style="s2">yes what would we expect to see as</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.750" end="00:26:02.980" style="s2">implications or ramifications or second</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.240" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2">or the next order effects from this</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.980" end="00:26:09.670" style="s2">period of involuntary separation from</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:11.860" style="s2">our social context well I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.670" end="00:26:16.510" style="s2">the things that I worry most about is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.860" end="00:26:21.750" style="s2">that when you are overtaxed in this way</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.510" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">by in voluntary isolation one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.750" end="00:26:28.590" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:36.060" style="s2">of the brain that is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.590" end="00:26:39.940" style="s2">fatigued or slowly Minh vested in is</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.060" end="00:26:43.510" style="s2">your prefrontal cortex your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.940" end="00:26:44.590" style="s2">think abstractly plan contingencies that</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.510" end="00:26:50.670" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.590" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">etc so I mean in effect you get Dumber</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.670" end="00:26:56.260" style="s2">right when we should not get Dumber this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:27:00.730" style="s2">is a bad time for all of us to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.260" end="00:27:02.740" style="s2">Dumber but but that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.730" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">that we can expect from long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.740" end="00:27:07.960" style="s2">social isolation and this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:09.640" style="s2">people when they talk about depression</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.960" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">one of the symptoms of depression is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.640" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">cognitive difficulties problems with</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">memory and so forth this is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:21.160" style="s2">thing we can expect from social</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.080" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">isolation as well interesting let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.160" end="00:27:25.330" style="s2">on from that a little bit that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:29.860" style="s2">good and very deep very powerful level</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.330" end="00:27:33.660" style="s2">of analysis I would I&#39;m curious what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.860" end="00:27:37.540" style="s2">think about that perhaps a unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.660" end="00:27:40.900" style="s2">rejection of this phenomena of social</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.540" end="00:27:42.700" style="s2">isolation and the resultant depression</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.900" end="00:27:46.300" style="s2">or quasi depression is what may be</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:48.510" style="s2">driving this earlier than is probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.300" end="00:27:51.130" style="s2">good from a public health perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.510" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">reopening you know people have an</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.130" end="00:27:58.180" style="s2">absolute live beto to escape this state</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">of social isolation and if we had add to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.180" end="00:28:05.050" style="s2">it your hypothesis that the prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">cortex functioning has also been reduced</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.050" end="00:28:09.490" style="s2">and you know the PFC is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:11.620" style="s2">important for planning particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.490" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">things that require multiple steps and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.620" end="00:28:18.670" style="s2">so if the prefrontal cortex functioning</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:21.250" style="s2">is decreased the ability to make optimal</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.670" end="00:28:23.020" style="s2">trade-offs between continuing social</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.250" end="00:28:26.220" style="s2">isolation even with some pain and some</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.020" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">negatives and breaking social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.220" end="00:28:31.630" style="s2">so as to relieve yourself of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:33.910" style="s2">low-level aggravating depression and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.630" end="00:28:36.290" style="s2">that may be what&#39;s one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.910" end="00:28:39.590" style="s2">driving factors to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.290" end="00:28:41.270" style="s2">to this perhaps to rapid reopening yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.590" end="00:28:42.830" style="s2">I think that&#39;s absolutely the case I</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.270" end="00:28:46.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s absolutely the case and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.830" end="00:28:50.420" style="s2">is where they&#39;re suddenly there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.400" end="00:28:53.540" style="s2">role for culture in social norms right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.420" end="00:28:57.070" style="s2">because if your culture is one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.540" end="00:29:00.380" style="s2">going to emphasize more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.070" end="00:29:03.020" style="s2">pro-social behavior or you have through</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.380" end="00:29:07.250" style="s2">whatever media of communication the TV</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.020" end="00:29:09.230" style="s2">you know the newspaper the internet just</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.250" end="00:29:14.990" style="s2">eat shouting across the street at a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.230" end="00:29:16.820" style="s2">socially distant safe space whether you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.990" end="00:29:19.220" style="s2">know if you if you know that your your</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.820" end="00:29:23.960" style="s2">broad social community is also doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.220" end="00:29:26.600" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing then it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.960" end="00:29:29.720" style="s2">easier for you to do it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.600" end="00:29:32.210" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s gonna encode a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.720" end="00:29:35.540" style="s2">that I&#39;m part of my group back into your</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.210" end="00:29:37.580" style="s2">mind right but if your group is disposed</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.540" end="00:29:41.000" style="s2">or your culture is disposed to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.580" end="00:29:44.260" style="s2">this I don&#39;t believe the government you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.000" end="00:29:47.330" style="s2">know if you&#39;re more of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.260" end="00:29:50.740" style="s2">individualistic culture I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.330" end="00:29:54.380" style="s2">like that term but it&#39;ll serve for now</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:29:56.780" style="s2">like we have in the u.s. I like the old</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.380" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">you know McLuhan you know paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.780" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">culture I think that was McLuhan then</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:06.740" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be a lot more agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">with just sort of going out and risking</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.740" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">infection or you might not even realize</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:13.300" style="s2">that you are risking infection you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.220" end="00:30:15.170" style="s2">just say oh this is all and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.300" end="00:30:17.510" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a harder time</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.170" end="00:30:20.360" style="s2">resisting that because it&#39;s gonna feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.510" end="00:30:24.590" style="s2">like an opportunity cost to your brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.360" end="00:30:26.360" style="s2">to stay home and remain isolated so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.590" end="00:30:29.090" style="s2">more that feels like an I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:30.650" style="s2">this that&#39;s you know this is a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.090" end="00:30:32.660" style="s2">bit of a tangent but that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.650" end="00:30:35.990" style="s2">subjective experience of mental fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.660" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">literally is mental fatigue is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.990" end="00:30:44.330" style="s2">literally a decrease in energy in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">brain mental fatigue is the signal that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.330" end="00:30:48.800" style="s2">you get subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:50.090" style="s2">from your brain that whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.800" end="00:30:51.770" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.090" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">you&#39;d rather be doing something else</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.770" end="00:31:00.980" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense let&#39;s move on</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.380" end="00:31:03.620" style="s2">to a a Cintiq which I&#39;m gonna call zoom</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.980" end="00:31:05.990" style="s2">culture yeah we all we all know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.620" end="00:31:08.929" style="s2">we&#39;re doing a lot of people at least are</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.990" end="00:31:11.179" style="s2">doing a lot more virtual interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.929" end="00:31:14.059" style="s2">I will say as we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.179" end="00:31:15.710" style="s2">pregame talk a little bit you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.059" end="00:31:17.570" style="s2">busier than I&#39;ve ever been at least in</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.710" end="00:31:20.210" style="s2">the last 19 years since I retired from</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.570" end="00:31:22.279" style="s2">my business career and most of that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.210" end="00:31:25.789" style="s2">on zoom I probably do 20 zooms a week</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.279" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">now up from maybe 10 G&#39;s prior to prior</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.789" end="00:31:32.000" style="s2">to the pandemic and personally it works</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:34.250" style="s2">for me I don&#39;t find it draining the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.000" end="00:31:36.500" style="s2">some people report etc and it may just</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.250" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">be my own quirk of quite extroverted</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.500" end="00:31:43.940" style="s2">personality but I like zoom culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:46.340" style="s2">essentially replaced for me that watch</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.940" end="00:31:48.380" style="s2">much of which I gave up that a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.340" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">phone calls to especially to my closest</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.380" end="00:31:53.630" style="s2">friends and my brothers and my cousins</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:56.390" style="s2">and my nephews and this and that but</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.630" end="00:31:59.029" style="s2">again I may well be an outlier I know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.390" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">that I am in many ways give us your</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.029" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">thoughts from your scientific</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:06.409" style="s2">perspective of to what degree zoom</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:08.450" style="s2">culture is a reasonable substitute or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.409" end="00:32:11.059" style="s2">partial substitute or may actually may</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.450" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">even make things worse I&#39;d love to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.059" end="00:32:15.950" style="s2">the neuroscience perspective on this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.340" end="00:32:19.010" style="s2">well you know again I I appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.950" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">resources so how hard is whatever task</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.010" end="00:32:25.070" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to accomplish on when</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:28.370" style="s2">you&#39;re using zoom versus when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.070" end="00:32:30.130" style="s2">person right and if the the task that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.370" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to accomplish is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.130" end="00:32:37.309" style="s2">communicate simple messages to hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:40.279" style="s2">of people as in you know one of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.309" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">big webinars or whatever then clearly</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.279" end="00:32:45.770" style="s2">zoom is super easy right and and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:52.419" style="s2">gonna be it&#39;s gonna feel easier because</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.770" end="00:32:59.590" style="s2">it is easier right but if the task is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.419" end="00:33:02.990" style="s2">understand and implicitly react to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.590" end="00:33:03.350" style="s2">subtle nonverbals as you interact with</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.990" end="00:33:07.730" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.350" end="00:33:11.900" style="s2">staff or your boss or you know public</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.730" end="00:33:15.049" style="s2">official or whatever it is then zooms</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.900" end="00:33:17.660" style="s2">gonna make it harder because zoom is</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.049" end="00:33:20.840" style="s2">simply it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.660" end="00:33:25.400" style="s2">mp3 file of communication right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.840" end="00:33:28.340" style="s2">just it&#39;s just taken out a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.400" end="00:33:32.360" style="s2">the it&#39;s digital it&#39;s digital and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.340" end="00:33:35.419" style="s2">reduced and compressed digital and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.360" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">are designed for analog right and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.419" end="00:33:43.850" style="s2">analog creates way more information and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">our brains are set up to one respond to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.850" end="00:33:48.919" style="s2">that information and to wonder where the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:49.640" style="s2">hell that information is if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.919" end="00:33:52.429" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.640" end="00:33:55.280" style="s2">and that wondering that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.429" end="00:33:58.220" style="s2">wondering creates an extra process that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.280" end="00:34:00.309" style="s2">the brain doesn&#39;t want to engage in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.220" end="00:34:04.580" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to spend more you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.309" end="00:34:06.950" style="s2">always want to spend less so for a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.580" end="00:34:10.609" style="s2">of people not you Jim but for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.950" end="00:34:12.980" style="s2">people zoom communications because they</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.609" end="00:34:16.010" style="s2">lack a lot of that essential implicit</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.980" end="00:34:18.859" style="s2">information they create an extra</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.010" end="00:34:22.100" style="s2">cognitive process that people have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.859" end="00:34:25.100" style="s2">engage in to try and figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.100" end="00:34:27.710" style="s2">they&#39;re communicating and what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.100" end="00:34:29.270" style="s2">communicated to them now if you add in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.710" end="00:34:33.409" style="s2">here&#39;s a simple way to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.270" end="00:34:38.139" style="s2">add in the little zoom window that shows</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.409" end="00:34:40.909" style="s2">you right that reflects you right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.139" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">now you&#39;ve added yet another cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.909" end="00:34:45.550" style="s2">process because you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:49.300" style="s2">self-monitoring load that you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.550" end="00:34:51.429" style="s2">under ordinary analog communication</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.300" end="00:34:54.399" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.429" end="00:34:56.740" style="s2">this is why I think zoom it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.399" end="00:34:59.170" style="s2">useful for certain kinds of projects and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.740" end="00:35:01.000" style="s2">for me I use it i-i&#39;ve even found it</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.170" end="00:35:03.640" style="s2">helpful in a lot of ways teaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.000" end="00:35:05.589" style="s2">courses for example now I know all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.640" end="00:35:08.049" style="s2">names of my students because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.589" end="00:35:08.650" style="s2">printed in front of me but over the long</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.049" end="00:35:10.510" style="s2">haul</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.650" end="00:35:11.650" style="s2">the returns I&#39;ve said in at least one</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.510" end="00:35:13.569" style="s2">interview elsewhere are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.650" end="00:35:15.869" style="s2">diminishing and they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.569" end="00:35:18.670" style="s2">diminishing and just the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.869" end="00:35:20.700" style="s2">economic curve that that you might think</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.670" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">of when you think of diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.700" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">let me push back on that just a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:28.240" style="s2">bit okay except when watching myself as</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:30.299" style="s2">I become more of a Zoomer</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.240" end="00:35:33.369" style="s2">and just to give you a sense of my own</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.299" end="00:35:35.559" style="s2">uses of zoom let&#39;s say I do 20 zooms a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.369" end="00:35:38.049" style="s2">week about 15 or one-on-ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.559" end="00:35:40.390" style="s2">you know communications with people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.049" end="00:35:44.920" style="s2">reach out to me through having heard my</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.390" end="00:35:47.109" style="s2">podcast or active on my Facebook groups</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.920" end="00:35:49.420" style="s2">rally point alpha and the game B group</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.109" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">or lots of old friends well you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.420" end="00:35:54.190" style="s2">just pairwise interactions and and those</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:56.410" style="s2">are pretty good and then the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.190" end="00:35:59.289" style="s2">interesting ones are three or four small</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.410" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">group conversations a week somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.289" end="00:36:06.730" style="s2">between 4 and 8 people and those seem to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">go well and one a week or maybe two of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.730" end="00:36:13.089" style="s2">these large group webinar things which I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.390" end="00:36:15.099" style="s2">find ok frankly in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.089" end="00:36:18.130" style="s2">going to scientific big scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.099" end="00:36:20.170" style="s2">meetings are just ok right yeah the real</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.130" end="00:36:22.059" style="s2">meet at a scientific meeting to me is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.170" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">the conversation the hallway and having</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.059" end="00:36:26.440" style="s2">a beer afterwards rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:29.349" style="s2">presentations I find the same fact room</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.440" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">from zoom but here&#39;s where I push back a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.349" end="00:36:34.180" style="s2">little bit as I said I&#39;ve been a Zoomer</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:35.980" style="s2">now with a significant amount of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.180" end="00:36:37.690" style="s2">interactions with the world but less</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.980" end="00:36:40.119" style="s2">than currently for a couple of years and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.690" end="00:36:43.809" style="s2">I found that I&#39;ve developed we might</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.119" end="00:36:46.930" style="s2">call procedural memories or now unloaded</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.809" end="00:36:48.910" style="s2">tasks that help me make zoom better you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.930" end="00:36:51.130" style="s2">mentioned one and when people ask me how</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.910" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">do you use zoom without going insane I</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.130" end="00:36:55.779" style="s2">say the first thing is never never look</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:57.970" style="s2">at that little box with you in it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.779" end="00:37:00.819" style="s2">interesting that I discovered more or</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.970" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">less intuitively what you could explain</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.819" end="00:37:05.230" style="s2">from a neuro and body energy perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.230" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">looking at your own little box in in</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:13.210" style="s2">zoom makes you do some processing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.830" style="s2">totally useless and may well be net</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.210" end="00:37:16.330" style="s2">negative right yeah we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.830" end="00:37:17.980" style="s2">experience in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.330" end="00:37:20.500" style="s2">and why the hell would we want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.980" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">now so so don&#39;t do that the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.500" end="00:37:25.000" style="s2">I have noticed particularly in these</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:27.340" style="s2">small groups which to me are more</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.000" end="00:37:29.590" style="s2">difficult to cognitively process than</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.340" end="00:37:32.410" style="s2">the pairwise the pairwise I look at is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.590" end="00:37:34.600" style="s2">much augmented form of a phone call</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.410" end="00:37:36.250" style="s2">basically so that is something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.600" end="00:37:37.869" style="s2">already know how to do is do long phone</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.250" end="00:37:39.250" style="s2">calls with our friends and people that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.869" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">want to talk to us and this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.250" end="00:37:42.850" style="s2">better way of doing phone calls but the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:45.010" style="s2">small group part where you really have</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.850" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">to read body language and whose turn it</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.010" end="00:37:49.740" style="s2">is to talk and all those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">I find that I am now focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.740" end="00:37:56.290" style="s2">people&#39;s Bobble emotions way more than I</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:59.080" style="s2">used to looking at their hands or their</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.290" end="00:38:01.030" style="s2">hands calm on their desk or are they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.080" end="00:38:02.140" style="s2">their hands kind of fidgeting around and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:04.930" style="s2">they&#39;re spreading and opening their</p>

<p begin="00:38:04.930" end="00:38:09.869" style="s2">that hey they feel it&#39;s their turn to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.490" end="00:38:12.070" style="s2">talk right are they leaning into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.869" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">camera and the mic or are they sitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.070" end="00:38:18.130" style="s2">back with their arms crossed and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:20.980" style="s2">probably wasn&#39;t doing that very much or</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.130" end="00:38:24.100" style="s2">at least as much on March first as I am</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.980" end="00:38:26.859" style="s2">doing now so I think that it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.100" end="00:38:31.330" style="s2">to learn to build unconscious so</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.859" end="00:38:34.840" style="s2">therefore relatively unloaded cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.330" end="00:38:38.290" style="s2">processes that allow one to extract a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.840" end="00:38:39.940" style="s2">lot though not all of the cues we get in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.290" end="00:38:42.850" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s focus particularly on this</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.940" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">small group thing in face to face from</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.850" end="00:38:46.359" style="s2">zoom and I&#39;m finding that the small</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:48.850" style="s2">groups are working better now than they</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.359" end="00:38:51.070" style="s2">were three months ago so I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.850" end="00:38:54.850" style="s2">all getting better at it but I will say</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.070" end="00:38:57.010" style="s2">that my prediction if I could borrow the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.850" end="00:39:00.760" style="s2">eyes of God for a little while to look</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.010" end="00:39:03.970" style="s2">at some of your zoom interactions would</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.760" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">be that you&#39;re it&#39;s not just you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.970" end="00:39:11.230" style="s2">noticing the finger movements and body</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:14.020" style="s2">postures of your conversation partners</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.230" end="00:39:16.750" style="s2">but it&#39;s also your conversation partners</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.020" end="00:39:19.060" style="s2">who are spending more time noticing</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.750" end="00:39:24.130" style="s2">their own body postures in their finger</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.060" end="00:39:26.980" style="s2">and and etc and that you know not to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.130" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">too fancy but you know anytime you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:30.580" style="s2">a conversation you start you start</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:32.170" style="s2">especially as the conversation moves on</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.580" end="00:39:35.320" style="s2">you start creating a kind of a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.170" end="00:39:37.240" style="s2">mini dynamical system right and so all</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.320" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">of that gets all that&#39;s gonna get and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.240" end="00:39:41.550" style="s2">work its way in the system itself is</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.730" end="00:39:45.070" style="s2">going to have a kind of cognitive load</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.550" end="00:39:46.870" style="s2">that I I worry about now I could be</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.070" end="00:39:50.650" style="s2">wrong I&#39;m totally speculating there and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.870" end="00:39:53.770" style="s2">I would also say that I have found</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.650" end="00:39:56.230" style="s2">certain activities to be remarkably</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.770" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">easier with zoom and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.230" end="00:40:01.870" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna remember as things if</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:02.980" style="s2">things ever get back to normal so for</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.870" end="00:40:05.350" style="s2">example one of the things I spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.980" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">of my time doing is editing papers with</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.350" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">grad students and kind of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:16.090" style="s2">hates that students hate it I hate it we</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:18.550" style="s2">passed manuscripts back and forth they</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.090" end="00:40:20.680" style="s2">get lost what version is it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.550" end="00:40:23.740" style="s2">when we sit together in a room it feels</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.680" end="00:40:28.330" style="s2">awkward to sit side-by-side looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.740" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">screen together but somehow doing a zoom</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.330" end="00:40:32.610" style="s2">conversation and sharing the screen and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:36.730" style="s2">looking at the document at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.610" end="00:40:38.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just magical it&#39;s it I I do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.730" end="00:40:42.190" style="s2">every day now and find it actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.980" end="00:40:44.950" style="s2">enjoyable whereas before I used to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.190" end="00:40:47.080" style="s2">it horrible so I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.950" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">thought carefully about why that is but</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.080" end="00:40:52.060" style="s2">I&#39;ll grant you that is one area that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:56.680" style="s2">that seems like zoom has made more</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.060" end="00:40:57.820" style="s2">efficient and efficiency if I&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.680" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">about all the stuff we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.820" end="00:41:01.750" style="s2">about today efficiency is the name of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:03.850" style="s2">the game that makes well of course a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.750" end="00:41:06.370" style="s2">of sense if evolution is what brought us</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.850" end="00:41:08.110" style="s2">to where we&#39;re at and Oh shocking I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.370" end="00:41:10.870" style="s2">actually believe in evolution unlike</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.790" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">of evolution we all know the real payoff</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.250" end="00:41:23.050" style="s2">is did you successfully reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:25.690" style="s2">everything else is secondary to that but</p>

<p begin="00:41:40.829" end="00:41:47.420" style="s2">article was expecting students to play</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.960" end="00:42:20.910" style="s2">we&#39;ve been socially isolated for months</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.170" end="00:42:57.540" style="s2">this well enough as a society to keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.839" end="00:42:58.260" style="s2">people from driving for example until</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.260" end="00:43:04.470" style="s2">just what I&#39;d like to do not really but</p>

<p begin="00:43:12.920" end="00:43:21.589" style="s2">terrifying reality that institutions</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.190" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">like UVA are facing which is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.589" end="00:43:32.040" style="s2">unfathomable hits in financial resources</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:36.359" style="s2">I mean that millions of dollars per</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.040" end="00:43:39.980" style="s2">semester that translate to support staff</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.359" end="00:43:42.089" style="s2">jobs people&#39;s livelihoods the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.980" end="00:43:45.510" style="s2">institutionally support research and</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.089" end="00:43:46.670" style="s2">teaching I mean it goes on and on to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.510" end="00:43:52.820" style="s2">keep the lights on</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.670" end="00:43:56.690" style="s2">and so people responsible for those</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.820" end="00:43:59.360" style="s2">kinds of problems are in a state of near</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.690" end="00:44:01.370" style="s2">constant panic trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.360" end="00:44:06.290" style="s2">to get the the proverbial lights back on</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.370" end="00:44:09.740" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an incentive for them not</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.290" end="00:44:13.670" style="s2">to think as carefully about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.740" end="00:44:15.410" style="s2">transmission risk right meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.670" end="00:44:19.580" style="s2">they&#39;re already getting a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.410" end="00:44:25.100" style="s2">dumber if I&#39;m right and certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.580" end="00:44:27.850" style="s2">kids are getting dumber and so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.100" end="00:44:31.540" style="s2">sort of going yeah sure sure these</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.850" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">college students can come back and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.540" end="00:44:36.890" style="s2">monitor their own health behavior well</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:38.210" style="s2">enough and so forth just as well as they</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.890" end="00:44:43.460" style="s2">can keep each other from getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.210" end="00:44:47.120" style="s2">pregnant and from crashing cars drinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:49.010" style="s2">too much on Saturday night yeah yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.120" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">I could be giving them too little credit</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.010" end="00:44:55.340" style="s2">maybe I am but I don&#39;t think I am and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">also when I factor in the the the sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.340" end="00:45:01.220" style="s2">of the incentive that the power</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:05.000" style="s2">structure in the administration here and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.220" end="00:45:10.190" style="s2">elsewhere has to you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.000" end="00:45:12.110" style="s2">financial commitments to reopen then it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.190" end="00:45:13.310" style="s2">seems to me like it&#39;s it&#39;s just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.110" end="00:45:15.710" style="s2">a lot of pressure to make the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.310" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">decision here and I think it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.710" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">it there&#39;s also a lot of pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.220" end="00:45:27.350" style="s2">discount the cost of those decisions for</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:30.740" style="s2">populations outside the student</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.350" end="00:45:35.090" style="s2">population not just faculty but you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.740" end="00:45:37.460" style="s2">custodial staff the local community that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.090" end="00:45:40.820" style="s2">has nothing to do with the university</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.460" end="00:45:43.220" style="s2">many of whom are highly vulnerable aging</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.820" end="00:45:46.540" style="s2">or african-american where these are</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.220" end="00:45:49.400" style="s2">groups that we know are at higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.540" end="00:45:51.050" style="s2">so you know we&#39;re not just playing with</p>
