<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:14.750" style="s2">that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">I was watching Norah Bates and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.750" end="00:01:20.780" style="s2">complexity of Kult climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">cultural revolution hey Stephanie</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.780" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">glad you were here does show zero</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">viewers it&#39;s lying it was will end which</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">I highly recommend her her talk on</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">future thinkers talking about how this</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">idea of climate change in how importance</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">it is and it is life or death but in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">solving it were kind of breaking the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:51.149" style="s2">system because if we do what let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.159" style="s2">extinction rebellion and people want us</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.149" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">to do not even so sure if they know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.159" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">they&#39;re doing but if we do it then we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:02:00.509" style="s2">are like complete collapsing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:02.579" style="s2">the complexity and a lot of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.509" end="00:02:04.770" style="s2">and creating new issues and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.579" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">have a way to deal with that and so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.770" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">we don&#39;t do anything and continue along</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">our trajectory we&#39;re screwed and if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">do what people want us to do which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">like everybody goes vegan</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:17.989" style="s2">just like shut everything down hone and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:20.209" style="s2">everything we&#39;re also screwed and part</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.989" end="00:02:23.150" style="s2">of what she talks about which is much</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.209" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">more better at this than that I have but</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.150" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">part of it was her talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:29.690" style="s2">she&#39;s talking with her children on these</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:31.940" style="s2">on these issues and that for her to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.690" end="00:02:32.750" style="s2">that she has an a solution would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.940" end="00:02:36.019" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.750" end="00:02:39.019" style="s2">that she like is gonna get lost in and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.019" end="00:02:41.830" style="s2">the like raw lostness with them and like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.019" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna figure this out together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.830" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">that is what I feel we are going to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.470" end="00:02:50.330" style="s2">is I&#39;m not really in the raw loss</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:52.100" style="s2">witness anymore because I have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.330" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">on how we can co-create a better world</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.100" end="00:02:57.970" style="s2">together which involves us a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:03:00.590" style="s2">getting lost in the wrongness of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.970" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">making the safety net making the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.590" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">emotional support and the community</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:07.400" style="s2">support that each of us needs to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">through that process without ever</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.400" end="00:03:11.569" style="s2">demanding and anybody goes through that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:15.590" style="s2">process anything that has game be</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.569" end="00:03:18.500" style="s2">anything that is coming out of what out</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.590" end="00:03:20.750" style="s2">of this chaos that is game a has to in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.500" end="00:03:25.430" style="s2">my opinion include everyone exactly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.750" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">where and how they are and then if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.430" end="00:03:31.400" style="s2">need them to be better demanding it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:33.590" style="s2">never the way to go</p>

<p begin="00:03:38.019" end="00:03:42.920" style="s2">there&#39;s so much that I deal with in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:45.380" style="s2">project of people saying like what about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.920" end="00:03:49.310" style="s2">the people who do X or do why are people</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.380" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">who way I have a question that something</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.310" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">just chimes on my computer does everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:54.500" style="s2">else hear that - they do writes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:55.549" style="s2">might we pick it up 50 don&#39;t window I</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.549" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">computer so things don&#39;t pop up there</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.829" end="00:04:01.850" style="s2">should be an easy button there isn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:03.530" style="s2">I&#39;m sure there is an absolute way to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.850" end="00:04:07.130" style="s2">that and it does not work for my brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.530" end="00:04:09.560" style="s2">and that what we need to continually be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.130" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">doing well we&#39;re creating the technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.560" end="00:04:12.500" style="s2">that gives us the choice you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:14.060" style="s2">collaborate on a massive scale thanks</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.500" end="00:04:15.889" style="s2">reddit I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to know that</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.840" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">continually asking what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.580" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:31.260" style="s2">and then making it work and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">Nora I what kind of remember people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.260" end="00:04:34.770" style="s2">last names</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.890" end="00:04:36.540" style="s2">Bateson is that she was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.770" end="00:04:39.180" style="s2">what we need to do is feed the babies</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.540" end="00:04:41.220" style="s2">like that is the the essence of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.180" end="00:04:42.930" style="s2">needs to happen in order for climate</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.220" end="00:04:45.030" style="s2">change in order for empty poverty in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.930" end="00:04:48.810" style="s2">order for all of it to happen we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.030" end="00:04:52.440" style="s2">be feeding babies and so that is what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.810" end="00:04:55.140" style="s2">am talking about is how do we create the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.440" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">tools that make sure all of our needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.140" end="00:05:00.540" style="s2">are met without relying on the old</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:03.480" style="s2">system which is either you do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.540" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">yourself either literally by yourself or</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.480" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">with a tiny community you rely on</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">corporations to do it so you go for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:12.540" style="s2">solutions in the marketplace or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">third entity has been the government the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.540" end="00:05:17.400" style="s2">government will fix it and I for many</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">reasons I&#39;ve talked about many times do</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.400" end="00:05:20.670" style="s2">not think our governments are designed</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:22.950" style="s2">to do that nor they even looking to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.670" end="00:05:24.660" style="s2">that in some areas I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.950" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2">starting to look to do that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.660" end="00:05:28.170" style="s2">trying to figure a climate change but</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">they&#39;re how to to figure it out i tinker</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.170" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">with the system they&#39;re benefiting from</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:36.440" style="s2">while hopefully magically fixing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.060" end="00:05:39.770" style="s2">which is not that&#39;s not going to fix it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.440" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">even with like the feeding the babies</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.770" end="00:05:46.310" style="s2">the solutions are what are you currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.560" end="00:05:49.980" style="s2">doing to feed you and your family and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.310" end="00:05:53.030" style="s2">how can we improve that and continually</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.980" end="00:05:53.030" style="s2">look into improve it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.510" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">extinction oh I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m gonna put</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2">this up on the screen send all over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:00.750" style="s2">provincia I think he may be over some</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:02.490" style="s2">point as far as I can tell Nora wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.750" end="00:06:05.100" style="s2">getting that specific your filly with</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.490" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">their platform hi Amex Merliah with</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.100" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">exchanger millions platform but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">infected last weeks on how we could</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:13.020" style="s2">actually said I didn&#39;t because my kid</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">was interrupting me and I was about to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.020" end="00:06:15.810" style="s2">go to the climate March and no one was</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:19.590" style="s2">here to watch so I wasn&#39;t answering the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.810" end="00:06:20.970" style="s2">questions but I do think like what they</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.810" end="00:07:31.410" style="s2">they&#39;re clearly not so the only solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.880" end="00:07:33.300" style="s2">is to go out in the streets and March</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.410" end="00:07:36.210" style="s2">and demand our governments do something</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.300" end="00:07:37.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe our governments are</p>

<p begin="00:07:37.860" end="00:07:43.620" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just about mass change</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:52.320" style="s2">about and so we need a much more dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:54.510" style="s2">and livable system that reacts to things</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.320" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">as they occur that isn&#39;t what our</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.200" end="00:08:05.040" style="s2">four years which is what the citizen</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">assembly is supposed to overcome right</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.040" end="00:08:09.500" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to be well if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:12.780" style="s2">citizens who understand it then we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.500" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">then go beyond that for years the issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.780" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">is I mean I had put out like well we</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">could do citizen assemblies we can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:20.850" style="s2">them ourselves what I didn&#39;t realize is</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:23.850" style="s2">people aren&#39;t me and they don&#39;t actually</p>

<p begin="00:08:28.440" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">for that to be something in the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.610" end="00:08:32.520" style="s2">but they don&#39;t actually want to sit on</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.310" end="00:08:44.790" style="s2">else to do that and the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:47.510" style="s2">the citizen assemblies isn&#39;t that those</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.790" end="00:08:50.839" style="s2">people are experts it&#39;s that they are</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.839" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">that are then informed by experts or</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.970" end="00:09:00.620" style="s2">truly understand the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and then give guidance</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.620" end="00:09:04.310" style="s2">to the government on what to do and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.649" style="s2">the government then has to act on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.310" end="00:09:08.569" style="s2">because this political back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.649" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">between right and left and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.569" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">taking action because that&#39;s why our</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:12.319" style="s2">governments aren&#39;t designed to take</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.240" end="00:09:33.079" style="s2">like not enough for one side and too</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.310" end="00:09:43.430" style="s2">work for us because we&#39;re the US so if</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.000" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">it and we have to be able to to tinker</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.100" end="00:10:04.579" style="s2">with it and figure out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:07.660" style="s2">well we&#39;re still allowing it to exist</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.439" end="00:11:07.190" style="s2">better is how we make the global system</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.590" end="00:11:09.790" style="s2">we can work backwards and recreate the</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.750" end="00:15:25.400" style="s2">know when I was a vegetarian and I did I</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">was in my early 20s I totally was like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.400" end="00:15:28.490" style="s2">well that&#39;s gross you can&#39;t eat it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.490" end="00:15:33.050" style="s2">never did anyone change to vegetarianism</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.470" end="00:15:35.660" style="s2">because of how I presented it but when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.050" end="00:15:37.280" style="s2">just shut up and ate salads every day at</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.660" end="00:15:39.290" style="s2">work it was just and I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.280" end="00:15:40.370" style="s2">sleeping eating media them because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.290" end="00:15:41.690" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a vegetarian at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.370" end="00:15:43.670" style="s2">time people were like oh yeah you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.690" end="00:15:45.170" style="s2">inspired me to let I was like this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.670" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">wasn&#39;t about inspiring you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.170" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">like me doing me and I&#39;m like that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:52.190" style="s2">the key you do you show that it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:53.930" style="s2">idea and other people will come on board</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.190" end="00:15:57.890" style="s2">especially if it is a good idea if it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.930" end="00:16:01.610" style="s2">actually feeds people if it actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.890" end="00:16:03.710" style="s2">gets the solution made without demanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.610" end="00:16:06.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s the solution without saying I</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.710" end="00:16:07.880" style="s2">know I&#39;m saying I have the solution but</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.350" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be the solution till</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.880" end="00:16:12.500" style="s2">it&#39;s actually made and the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:14.840" style="s2">it is the solution is because within the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.500" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">system is designed that it will</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.840" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">incrementally get better</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:21.410" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a utopia we get to its proto</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:24.800" style="s2">Pia constantly looking for improvement</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.410" end="00:16:25.970" style="s2">and ways to make our system and our</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.800" end="00:16:27.320" style="s2">technology which is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.970" end="00:16:29.660" style="s2">concentrating on is making the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.320" end="00:16:33.170" style="s2">technology that makes it possible for an</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.660" end="00:16:34.460" style="s2">individual to eat more healthy whatever</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.370" end="00:16:44.840" style="s2">that is to them and so looking at it as</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.580" end="00:16:57.200" style="s2">else it&#39;s about creating the system that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.740" end="00:16:59.480" style="s2">anyone at any point in time can put into</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.200" end="00:17:01.610" style="s2">here&#39;s why this isn&#39;t working for me</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.480" end="00:17:03.230" style="s2">here&#39;s what would improve it and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.610" end="00:17:05.209" style="s2">can be empowered to co-create the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.230" end="00:17:09.920" style="s2">solutions to that through tools and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.209" end="00:17:11.750" style="s2">systems or that is enough if you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.920" end="00:17:12.920" style="s2">put into the system yes and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.750" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">capable of doing that because I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.200" end="00:17:21.620" style="s2">there is no just if you&#39;re not listening</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.120" end="00:17:24.980" style="s2">to the person telling you what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.620" end="00:17:27.440" style="s2">problem is we&#39;re not fixing the problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.980" end="00:17:28.970" style="s2">the actual problem so the only way to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.870" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">so the you know 10% that&#39;s left not</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">caring about those babies doesn&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:10.380" style="s2">care about those things the issue is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.610" style="s2">entire system is kind of based on us all</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.380" end="00:18:15.899" style="s2">pointing the finger at each other and</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.580" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">locations and I get why they do that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.870" style="s2">quest you go and you pay you pay for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:38.370" style="s2">food but it&#39;s way less than what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.870" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">would pay in the supermarket so you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.370" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">to pick out what you want and they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:46.169" style="s2">a lot because it&#39;s Vancouver they have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:47.610" style="s2">lot of organic and a lot of like stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.169" end="00:23:49.049" style="s2">that comes from Whole Foods and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.610" end="00:23:51.090" style="s2">that comes from the local amazing</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.049" end="00:23:53.100" style="s2">bakeries so it&#39;s like day-old bread</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.090" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">that&#39;s ten cents or 25 cents a loaf</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.100" end="00:23:56.910" style="s2">which they could do better because they</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.770" style="s2">don&#39;t put in plastic so it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.910" end="00:24:00.059" style="s2">very stale but like they don&#39;t wrap it</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.770" end="00:24:04.860" style="s2">in plastic out there they just keep it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.059" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">in the same paper thing um their milk is</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.860" end="00:24:09.030" style="s2">also their milk is not ten cents and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.320" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like thirty it&#39;s maybe thirty</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.030" end="00:24:11.820" style="s2">percent less than what it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:14.220" style="s2">store I&#39;m like and it&#39;s expired that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.820" end="00:24:15.179" style="s2">makes no sense but a lot of their other</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.220" end="00:24:17.999" style="s2">stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.179" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">it keeps us in junk food at least junk</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.999" end="00:24:25.219" style="s2">food and produce are kind of like what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">go to quest for and then there&#39;s a local</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.219" end="00:24:30.330" style="s2">market that I was part of I was on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.570" end="00:24:33.419" style="s2">board of called Cedar Cottage Food</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:35.489" style="s2">Network where they bulk buy from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.419" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">produce places where people but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.489" end="00:24:39.779" style="s2">where produce people buy their produce</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:43.109" style="s2">from they bulk buy it and sell it at</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.779" end="00:24:44.940" style="s2">cost so every Saturday you can go to one</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.109" end="00:24:47.969" style="s2">of the locations and you can pick up and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.940" end="00:24:49.229" style="s2">most things are a dollar or a multiple</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.969" end="00:24:50.849" style="s2">of the dollar so maybe you get two</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.229" end="00:24:53.179" style="s2">apples or three apples for a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.849" end="00:24:55.710" style="s2">or you get a cantaloupe for a dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.179" end="00:24:57.299" style="s2">someone so it&#39;s subsidized somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.710" end="00:24:58.889" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually somewhat sold less</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.299" end="00:25:00.690" style="s2">than what it&#39;s cost a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.889" end="00:25:02.759" style="s2">but those are the kind of things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:05.879" style="s2">are done the last two options are done</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.759" end="00:25:08.039" style="s2">for the poor but they don&#39;t need to be I</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.879" end="00:25:09.779" style="s2">mean that the leftover food that so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.039" end="00:25:11.789" style="s2">sold at Qwest has to kind of be because</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.779" end="00:25:15.830" style="s2">he like that&#39;s coming available first</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.789" end="00:25:15.830" style="s2">it&#39;s based on the overproduction</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.859" end="00:25:19.529" style="s2">expiration of food</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.309" end="00:25:22.099" style="s2">not everyone can necessarily go there</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.529" end="00:25:24.989" style="s2">and shop but every we could bulk buy</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.099" end="00:25:27.089" style="s2">produce together we can both buy our</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.989" end="00:25:29.969" style="s2">groceries together we can create</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.089" end="00:25:31.289" style="s2">solutions that aren&#39;t needing to go to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.969" end="00:25:33.299" style="s2">the farmers market which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.289" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">astronomically expensive and not</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.299" end="00:25:37.309" style="s2">accessible to the poor it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.830" end="00:25:40.649" style="s2">accessible to the poor it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.309" end="00:25:42.179" style="s2">accessible like it&#39;s not and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.649" end="00:25:44.729" style="s2">why the farmer markets a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.179" end="00:25:46.229" style="s2">are so expensive is that well the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.729" end="00:25:49.409" style="s2">farmers put their labor into it of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.229" end="00:25:51.059" style="s2">course it&#39;s grown locally you they pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.409" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">decent amounts for their labor but like</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.059" end="00:25:55.919" style="s2">they&#39;re sitting at the farmers market</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:57.359" style="s2">for an entire Saturday or four hours of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.919" end="00:26:00.469" style="s2">their Saturday after picking this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.359" end="00:26:03.179" style="s2">and coming there and then driving back</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.469" end="00:26:04.200" style="s2">like their time is worth something and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.179" end="00:26:05.489" style="s2">they&#39;re sitting there answering the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.200" end="00:26:07.169" style="s2">questions and they&#39;re sitting there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.489" end="00:26:09.210" style="s2">like you&#39;re paying for the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.169" end="00:26:11.309" style="s2">meeting the farmer and being there we</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.210" end="00:26:12.839" style="s2">can create systems that honor the farmer</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.309" end="00:26:14.849" style="s2">the farmers time that their time is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.839" end="00:26:17.009" style="s2">spent better basically anywhere than</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.849" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">sitting in the farmers market and create</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.009" end="00:26:20.129" style="s2">the system that&#39;s like where is our food</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:22.139" style="s2">grown how can we make sure they make</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.129" end="00:26:23.969" style="s2">enough money not just the farmer</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.139" end="00:26:26.099" style="s2">themselves but also all of the people</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.969" end="00:26:28.010" style="s2">who touch that produce how do we make</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.099" end="00:26:29.870" style="s2">sure that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.010" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">every because even in Canada we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.870" end="00:26:33.470" style="s2">laborers coming from from exa code to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:33.800" style="s2">pick because no one here is gonna pick</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.470" end="00:26:36.590" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.800" end="00:26:38.630" style="s2">there&#39;s also though abundance farm which</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.590" end="00:26:44.000" style="s2">I&#39;m not part of but I love the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.630" end="00:26:46.130" style="s2">of is a not-for-profit farm cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.000" end="00:26:48.680" style="s2">farm I know what their legal structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.130" end="00:26:50.810" style="s2">would be called but basically you go and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.680" end="00:26:53.660" style="s2">participate in the labor and in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.810" end="00:26:55.580" style="s2">planning and in all of it and they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.660" end="00:26:58.250" style="s2">like they get your labor and you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.580" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">food and that same model could be done</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.250" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">over and over again where you get to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.490" end="00:27:07.850" style="s2">and participate and so it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:09.950" style="s2">back-breaking labor in a field where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.850" end="00:27:11.960" style="s2">have to like quota quota keep to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.950" end="00:27:14.330" style="s2">quota you know like your kids have to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.960" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">is you can your kids are doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:17.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not child labor right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.400" end="00:27:18.860" style="s2">like yeah we&#39;re all in the fields</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.450" end="00:27:20.450" style="s2">picking this where food comes from this</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.860" end="00:27:22.250" style="s2">is an important part of learning that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.450" end="00:27:24.770" style="s2">like this is come when we grow food and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.250" end="00:27:29.150" style="s2">we eat it and then there&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.770" end="00:27:31.580" style="s2">systems in the cities of 3d farms or</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.150" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">some is called 3d farms vertical farming</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.580" end="00:27:37.450" style="s2">and greenhouses mixed with fish so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:40.580" style="s2">know like one feeds the other one and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.450" end="00:27:42.650" style="s2">there are ways to produce food that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.580" end="00:27:44.450" style="s2">we&#39;re not even utilizing and if we do</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.650" end="00:27:46.460" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be done in a for-profit model</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.450" end="00:27:48.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s again a beautifully accessible</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.460" end="00:27:49.880" style="s2">to the ridge whereas if we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.500" end="00:27:52.250" style="s2">okay oh how much for one of those farms</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.880" end="00:27:55.720" style="s2">actually produce and how many people can</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.250" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">be involved and then what is the word</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.720" end="00:28:01.010" style="s2">franchisee that like fret like make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:02.780" style="s2">so you can create one easily you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.010" end="00:28:04.910" style="s2">need to pay the franchise fee and pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.780" end="00:28:06.920" style="s2">like when one city creates a tool</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.910" end="00:28:09.710" style="s2">library when one city creates a thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.920" end="00:28:11.180" style="s2">called quest that anyone can easily get</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.710" end="00:28:13.070" style="s2">in contact with like right here&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.180" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">did it there you go</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.070" end="00:28:18.890" style="s2">go ahead and do it we can co-create</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:21.710" style="s2">solutions that actually work by working</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.890" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">on what&#39;s done before and working from</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.710" end="00:28:25.670" style="s2">where we&#39;re at and finding ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:28.040" style="s2">like okay if we&#39;re putting our data into</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.670" end="00:28:31.940" style="s2">the system we can find ways to use each</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.040" end="00:28:34.580" style="s2">other&#39;s intellectual labor on what to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.940" end="00:28:36.770" style="s2">cook to solve the the food crisis and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.580" end="00:28:39.110" style="s2">so the what are the other ways I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.770" end="00:28:40.880" style="s2">getting my food needs fed over the last</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.110" end="00:28:41.870" style="s2">few weeks and it&#39;s actually a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.880" end="00:28:44.510" style="s2">late</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.870" end="00:28:47.029" style="s2">for intensive and any of the other ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.510" end="00:28:49.669" style="s2">and it&#39;s supposed to not be is I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.029" end="00:28:53.510" style="s2">using the market I&#39;ve been using these</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.669" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">meal prep companies that are way too</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.510" end="00:28:59.419" style="s2">expensive per day&#39;s produce way too much</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">waste and I&#39;m still doing most of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.419" end="00:29:03.890" style="s2">laboring and cleanup I&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">not I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re solving but</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.890" end="00:29:08.029" style="s2">I&#39;m still using you like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:11.179" style="s2">you&#39;re not it&#39;s way less work way more</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.029" end="00:29:12.380" style="s2">work community supported agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.179" end="00:29:17.090" style="s2">oh is that what abundance farm is called</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.380" end="00:29:19.700" style="s2">human Community Supported Agriculture or</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.090" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">CSA I&#39;ll CSA boxes yeah those ones okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.700" end="00:29:22.669" style="s2">I think abundance farms might be one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">those and then I know a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.669" end="00:29:27.980" style="s2">who use CSA like boxes of produce but</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:29.690" style="s2">even that like we need to make it better</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.980" end="00:29:31.490" style="s2">because then you I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.690" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">would not be any it would not be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.490" end="00:29:36.350" style="s2">to me like getting a box of produce that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:37.789" style="s2">I then have to figure out what the to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.350" end="00:29:39.230" style="s2">with it is if you know what an option</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.789" end="00:29:41.539" style="s2">it&#39;s just going out of my house in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.230" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">compost bin which means they like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.539" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">world grew it transported it to me and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:49.309" style="s2">then it&#39;s going just back to to create</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:51.470" style="s2">more soil because I can&#39;t think of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.309" end="00:29:53.090" style="s2">to cook with that I can&#39;t necessarily do</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.470" end="00:29:55.190" style="s2">the labor to cook the thing on the David</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.090" end="00:29:57.620" style="s2">that it&#39;s there and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.190" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">creating something that is like CSA box</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.620" end="00:30:02.659" style="s2">meets our shared intellectual knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:04.370" style="s2">of like here&#39;s three things you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.659" end="00:30:05.750" style="s2">cook with it that are in your CSA box I</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">know they do that they will give you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.750" end="00:30:10.549" style="s2">recipes that then it&#39;s missing four</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.260" style="s2">ingredients right like bulk buying the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.549" end="00:30:15.289" style="s2">ones that were not growing and making</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.260" end="00:30:16.700" style="s2">them into CSA boxes that are like fresh</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.289" end="00:30:17.659" style="s2">prep in these places that are in the</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.400" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">right now because it&#39;s the introductory</p>

<p begin="00:31:09.830" end="00:31:13.929" style="s2">I&#39;m trying them because I want to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.960" end="00:31:17.990" style="s2">about how do we create this system</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.929" end="00:31:20.690" style="s2">citywide that isn&#39;t this that is not for</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.130" end="00:31:26.090" style="s2">improving which is more like my</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.090" end="00:31:31.070" style="s2">prep and how do we do it with way less</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:32.870" style="s2">packaging and it&#39;s by doing it together</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.070" end="00:31:34.909" style="s2">it&#39;s my brainstorming right can we get</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.870" end="00:31:36.770" style="s2">it mason jars can we get like well</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.909" end="00:31:39.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a cost to that like the literal</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.770" end="00:31:41.539" style="s2">cost of mason jars and also transporting</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.350" end="00:31:45.070" style="s2">stuff that is heavier but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.539" end="00:31:48.860" style="s2">share in the labor how do we share the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.070" end="00:31:51.409" style="s2">economies of scale and make a system</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.860" end="00:31:54.350" style="s2">that you want to use if there was a meal</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.409" end="00:31:55.820" style="s2">prep delivery thing because that&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.350" end="00:31:59.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re calling it uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.820" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">that gives that brings you food it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.390" end="00:32:04.039" style="s2">vegan that brings you food that is super</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:08.360" style="s2">easy to make and or it&#39;s already made</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.039" end="00:32:11.000" style="s2">for you and it&#39;s cheap who&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.360" end="00:32:13.580" style="s2">to use that system the issue is if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.000" end="00:32:16.490" style="s2">you know ten if the price point is too</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">high or the convenience thing is too low</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.490" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like this is inconvenient I sell to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:23.210" style="s2">make all of this stuff well to cut it</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:24.919" style="s2">itself don&#39;t wash it i stuff to do all</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:52.210" style="s2">guests they wanted to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:54.220" style="s2">question to showcase publicly what a</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.210" end="00:34:56.919" style="s2">private conversation will look like up</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.220" end="00:34:59.170" style="s2">the new platform I wasn&#39;t finding that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.919" end="00:35:00.790" style="s2">fun after a few weeks because I found it</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.170" end="00:35:02.530" style="s2">hard to get people to come to 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.790" end="00:35:04.900" style="s2">on Wednesday and I didn&#39;t want to ask</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:15.339" style="s2">why why but why but why I can do that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:16.990" style="s2">could do that all day long</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.339" end="00:35:19.270" style="s2">that&#39;s what I need someone to come in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.990" end="00:35:22.060" style="s2">here and do every every Friday but why</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.270" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">why the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.060" end="00:35:25.380" style="s2">yeah I gets deeper and deeper I love it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:28.120" style="s2">I love it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.380" end="00:35:29.950" style="s2">HIPPA we can call we have no platform</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.120" end="00:35:30.490" style="s2">called the five wise but why do you do</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.950" end="00:35:34.690" style="s2">it that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.490" end="00:35:36.280" style="s2">now what will help yeah once we have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.690" end="00:35:38.410" style="s2">way for us to connect and have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.280" end="00:35:41.590" style="s2">conversation with humanity then we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.410" end="00:35:43.360" style="s2">open we can create everything with a few</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.590" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">added tools you a new project management</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.360" end="00:35:47.020" style="s2">we need to be able to find groups right</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:49.510" style="s2">and resonate with but all of that comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.020" end="00:35:51.850" style="s2">from showcasing that a conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.510" end="00:35:53.080" style="s2">not only possible we also need like we</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.850" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">need it to be fun we need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.080" end="00:35:57.460" style="s2">enjoyable and simple to save the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">and part of it is we don&#39;t see that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.460" end="00:36:02.050" style="s2">society because our interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:04.180" style="s2">other human beings on mass early social</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.050" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">media where we&#39;re disconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.180" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of trolling and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:10.420" style="s2">debate and a lot of you&#39;re right and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:13.810" style="s2">wrong and they&#39;re never gonna close that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.420" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">chasm and so requiring us first to close</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.810" end="00:36:18.190" style="s2">that chasm is not a great first step</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:21.190" style="s2">whereas creating the system that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.190" end="00:36:22.360" style="s2">showcases our similarities and showcases</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.190" end="00:36:25.180" style="s2">that everybody has something to</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.360" end="00:36:27.970" style="s2">contribute not only a fraction of us</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.180" end="00:36:30.790" style="s2">every single person has worth every</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.970" end="00:36:32.890" style="s2">single person is perfect exactly as they</p>
