<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">point</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">he talks about words as well and i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">you might find him in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.240" style="s2">because it could have just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">passed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.240" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">in the conversation i had with him but</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">so few people</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:17.600" style="s2">look at uh words</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:19.360" style="s2">and meaning and how we use them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">transfer meaning and make meaning</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.360" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">and so i&#39;m like let me check him out and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">as i told you you know</p>

<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">earned the right to shoot you an email</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:32.560" style="s2">and so far our conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">have been great that&#39;s thank you nick i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.560" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">i agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">so i i maybe you could start just by</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">introducing yourself a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">like say what it is you do um and say</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.000" style="s2">how that cert that sort of intersects</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">with you know the broader themes of you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.000" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">know embodied cognition</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">and things like that and as you see</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve already invoked it meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">how it&#39;s relevant to the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.560" style="s2">et cetera but like where are you coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">from and how you got here</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.560" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m sure our interests my viewers</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">will be really interested in hearing</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">that story</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a um well i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">know if it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.640" style="s2">odd background i think meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">important to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.640" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">so i guess all backgrounds are universal</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">here but</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">my specific journey uh has me</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">as a strength and conditioning coach now</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">bigger faster stronger for about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">last 17 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">as long as i have have been working</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">so i got my first gig at 15 years old i</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">was working in a gym</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">so rightly or wrongly that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">context i found myself in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">and a lot of it was driven out of out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">my own personal journey</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">to to find myself in a way and only now</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">reflection can i understand it and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">i mean by finding myself is i never</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">felt and this might sound superficial to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.840" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">some but i&#39;m still working through it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">i never found that the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">appeared on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">was the way that i felt on the inside so</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">i was a football player and a basketball</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:04.720" style="s2">player</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">and so like everyone call it a body</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">image but for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">i wanted to do something about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">entry into the movement space</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.640" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">into the strength and conditioning space</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">was through my own journey of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">of yes losing weight but i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.360" style="s2">gaining strength in in the control</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">in the discipline that came along with</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.360" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">it and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:30.640" style="s2">there was a number of key players when i</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">was in in high school let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.640" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">starting this journey but one of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:37.040" style="s2">his name is rudy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">and he was a strength conditioning coach</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.040" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">who worked at costco</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">during the day and on his own back</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">opened up the gym every day at 2 30</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">and he would come in he literally john</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">would ride up pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">on the board every day but that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">the real value he brought he started</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">to teach you how to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">alongside of physically preparing to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">a player</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">and again i could only fully appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">this as i grew towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">adulthood and so rudy taught me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">through movement i could</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">develop the whole person and again i</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">would not have used</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">those words even in college but i think</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was drawn to and so fast</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">i i got into the strength and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">conditioning space</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">ultimately as a context but my i would</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">say my deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">purpose is to help people in the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">that i had been helped and thus it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">path but very much so it has deeper</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">psychological meaning within it and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">reflect on that journey</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">and the journey i still feel that i&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">from there and so that just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">gives you a sense of if you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">how it all started now fast forward to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">i primarily work in professional sport</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">some might even look at what i do say</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">well have you actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">leveraged your your skill set your your</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">intrigue</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">to to the broadest community possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">not yet but i still consider myself not</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">that we ever shift out of student</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">but very much so on a journey of earning</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">to be listened to by by the world and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">honestly mean that and so for the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">15 years i was working</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">and so that let&#39;s say one level of my</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.680" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">language has always been important</p>

<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.880" style="s2">something with language but</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">the key thing for me the first time i</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.880" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">came into contact</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">with language and i became aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">that might sound really odd to many</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">people but think about we use</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">language all the time but how often do</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">we come</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">in contact with it how often can we stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">and notice it you know i&#39;m going to put</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">knowingly i think very often around</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">throughout our life we try to stop when</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">something really brings us joy</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">and share that with the other person and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">an interesting footnote but for me the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">first time i came in contact</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">with language i was pretty you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">general moment i was learning to become</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">a personal trainer</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">and i was following another trainer on</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">the floor</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:08.400" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been following him for for</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.400" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">and i was trying to understand why was</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:16.479" style="s2">he seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">as the lead trainer why was he seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.479" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">as being somehow more skilled at</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">training and developing others</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">than maybe some of the other individuals</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">on the floor and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">i started with the obvious place and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.800" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">that was the obvious</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">salient things his program</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">well what exercises does he do how many</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">reps and sets</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">how does he understand the client&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">how does he document how does he make</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">notes all the things that i could touch</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">and feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">and frankly were part of my textbooks</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">that said</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">this is the knowledge necessary to be a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">personal trainer and train other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">and i couldn&#39;t find the answer there</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.839" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">john because like well he&#39;s doing bench</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">press on monday</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">he&#39;s doing bicep curls and he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">all the same things</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s something different here i</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">can feel it and one day i</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">narrowed in on his his use of language</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">in that he was a very clever witty guy</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">is but he always protected</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">the moment before the client would move</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">to give them one idea to give them an</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">idea that could be</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">salient that could dominate their mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">be a passenger</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">if you would guiding how they move i</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">like to call it the address and the gps</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">gives them that one central thought and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll never forget i was struck by</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">what otherwise was a basic moment in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">and i never i&#39;ll never forget a day or</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">so later i went to another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">senior mentor</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">and i said what this guy is doing i</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">don&#39;t even know if he realizes it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">but one day i got to write a book called</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.160" style="s2">the form within nobody&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.160" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">it&#39;s ever present we talk and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">communicate all the time</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">and we know intuitively it makes this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">profound difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">in ourselves how we think and how we use</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">language to think but also</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">how we interact with others i got to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">something about this</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">but you know it was one of those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">that i was not prepared</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">to action and so it was over</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">a decade later that these ideas started</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">to mature</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">again i started to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">the resources that had something to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">about how our words</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">impact thinking and how what we think</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">while we move ultimately impacts how we</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">move and anyone who&#39;s played tennis</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">or golf who&#39;s had the bad day out</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">they know the dark side of what thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">can do while we move</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">right but i think we&#39;ve also enjoyed the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">ahas as you and i have talked about are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">the light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this this meshing between</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:59.839" style="s2">thought and movement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">that starts to start to tap into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.839" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">embodiment how well they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s how do i as a coach how do i</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">as a teacher how do i insert myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:15.519" style="s2">in that loop in that process</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">well i&#39;m not a puppet master i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.519" end="00:11:21.040" style="s2">have strings on their body</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">but i do have language i can put words</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">into their mind with the hopes that if</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">they&#39;re unpacked</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">they could make a meaningful difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">that ultimately in my world changes the</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">way they move</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">for the better which tends to converge</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">with why that person is there they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">pursuing a goal</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">that has a movement basis and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">helping them</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">achieve an end as many people had helped</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">me achieve an end and so fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">now to 2016</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">i start writing the book 2020 the book</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">was published</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">and the book lives basically on on 15</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">years of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">a decade of thinking and practicing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:04.959" style="s2">a phd stuck in there just to make sure i</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">was on the right course</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.959" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">and four and four years of writing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">where does that bring me today today i</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">uh and i mean today in a broader sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">not literally today</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">and this starts to converge on why what</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">you and i are talking about is so</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve been saying this now for years to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">my wife i i i came to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">strength and conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">is not my purpose it is my context it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">arena to use your word john right right</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">i find that my my purpose i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">if i show you this but i have truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">tattooed on my form right right that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">quite it</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">and you see here that the u in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">middle is red</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">the red almost like blood the lifeline</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">of is to is to respect that truth is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">fluid to the degree that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">personal truth a truth that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">objectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">concrete like an object there is what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">might hope there&#39;s a reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a direct context or a realism as</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">we might get into with dreyfus and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">taylor</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:09.760" style="s2">but then there&#39;s this ever search for</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">personal truth and so i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.760" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">shared this with you yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.880" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">but that is my core value</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">not above all else is what i pursue and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">when rafe kelly says this guy john</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:24.560" style="s2">verveiki let me watch the videos</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">and i start to get in there i see a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.560" end="00:13:28.880" style="s2">person who</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.240" style="s2">is is enacting his own journey even</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.880" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">though you&#39;re much farther in your</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.240" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:35.680" style="s2">i if i can say this i see your pain i</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">see your struggle</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.680" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">i see your pursuit of something and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">resonates or reverberates</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">inside of me and what i&#39;ve realized in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">in these discussions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">in partnership in the broadest sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">i believe i can start to take what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">and i can share it with the world i can</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">give it a broader platform i can do</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">what i know is inside of me and in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">better understand myself my own truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">and the meaning that i seek to make in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.680" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">in this world and so that&#39;s where i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">maybe end</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">and allow you to sharpen the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">conversation from here but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">that gives you the journey and how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">came into contact</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">that was excellent nick so here here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">place that i i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">resonates with me right away especially</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">with that what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:30.800" style="s2">uh truth yeah i have to tattoos too um</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve got uh meditation and concentration</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.800" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">i got to know thyself here</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">um so yeah tattooing is a good way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">create the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.920" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">talismanic reminders of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">committing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">um but so that the way the idea of truth</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">um there because let&#39;s zero in on a term</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">that sort of bridges i think this notion</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">of realization when people realize</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">things which is both the like you said</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">those ah-ha moments</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">but also the way in which their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">bodies and the world is disclosed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">them in a new pattern</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">and then it&#39;s that new pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">affords them</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.519" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">transforming how they&#39;re moving how</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">they&#39;re moving how they&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">inhabiting their bodies</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">and and you&#39;ve given me several examples</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">which i</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">i would i&#39;m asking i&#39;m requesting that</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">you would share one of those examples</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">of how you&#39;ve gone in there&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re trying to correct</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">their movement right like you did the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">example of somebody who&#39;s sprinting</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve done examples of</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve given me several examples and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">found each one really tasty</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">right and then what you did is the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">in which you you found that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">you know the mujust you found you found</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.320" style="s2">that you know bridges between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.399" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">propositional the perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.320" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">and it affords that aha realization</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">and an affordance opens up for them and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">then they start to move</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">in a new way and it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">from them knowing that they need to move</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">in a new way</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">like you say just practicing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">something that you did that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">right their perspectival knowing so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">start to inhabit the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">and their body in a different way and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">and that and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">the language borders on like on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">on like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">on poetry on one side and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">like magic</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">right in in on the other side because</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s actually sort of making something</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">possible for people</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">first of all is that a fair description</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:22.639" style="s2">of oh no</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">completely completely it&#39;s i know</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.639" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:27.519" style="s2">and i have i think uh a good example for</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">which we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.519" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">we might be able to go through others in</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">a different angle</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">but let me use a simple one that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">everyone can relate to and i think i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">shared the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">of my son learning to ride his bike i</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">think this one probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">more than the others eloquently</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">articulates what you&#39;re describing there</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a long story so i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">share the latter half</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">it goes something like this during the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">covet period</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">my son was learning to ride his bike and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:58.399" style="s2">as he was learning to ride his bike i</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">find as someone who studies learning</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.399" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">quite literally professionally that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">understanding how and why learning takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">place becomes quite important to me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">these are beautiful natural time points</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">as a parent</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">to see in action and also often times</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">see where you are miserably wrong at</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">least wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">and so it got me thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">what what underpins learning</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:31.679" style="s2">which is to say why do we need coaches</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">you know you alluded to i was able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.679" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">language to intervene to positively</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">disrupt</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.840" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">i might say yeah and allow for a new</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">reorganization that this person desired</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">but we also know that people learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:46.880" style="s2">things all the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">without coaches without teachers some</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.880" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">people might say that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">greatest learning takes place and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">for me i&#39;ve just been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">well why do we need</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:58.880" style="s2">coaches and by no means am i saying this</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">is 100 accurate but at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">pragmatically</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve started to observe that four</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">if met allow learning and here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">talking about movement learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">but i do believe this transcends</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">movement that four conditions if</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">if set learning will occur call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.840" style="s2">naturally</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">but certain disruptions with these</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.840" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">without intervention might either result</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:29.120" style="s2">neutralization or the flatlining of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.120" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">so i stay the way i am and for for an</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">elite person that might be great</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">but in other instances right if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">don&#39;t use it you lose it</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">if i stop engaging with the practice i</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">start to see erosion</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">and so the four preconditions for</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">learning for me were the following</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">one there needs to be a clear goal it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">salient at some level it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">be salient</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">at the propositional level it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">that the four or five-year-old needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:18:59.360" style="s2">be able to clearly articulate</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">the goal of riding a bike but the goal</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.360" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">still needs to be self-evident to them</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">from a perceptual perspective so it</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">needs to be a goal uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">number two there needs to be a a</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">meaning there needs to be immediate</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">feedback that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">obvious again that is salient to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">learner</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">third piece is there has to be a desire</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">there needs to be a desire to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">the goal</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:24.400" style="s2">if there is no desire there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">motivating the pursuit and the practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.400" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s not likely to begin and then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">fourth and final one</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">is they need to have the capability</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">of achieving this skill and so my son</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">for example when riding the bike</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">he would literally have to be tall</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">enough and strong enough to pedal the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">bike</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">if those preconditions were not met it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if the goal is clear the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">feedback is there and the desire is</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">and so i think you could extend these</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">four conditions to other things</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">but here we are he&#39;s learning to ride</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">his bike and sure enough early on</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s coaching me he&#39;s like dad let</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:01.760" style="s2">me go</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">hold on let go push faster he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.760" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">orchestrating the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">and so fine he learns the training</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:09.440" style="s2">wheels come off</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">happy days the goal is clear in my case</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.440" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">he wants to beat his sister on the walk</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">so he wants to be sister this thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">needs to not fall over so the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">he has a desire to beat his sister</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">around the block</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">and the feedback well well gravity is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">heck of a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">yeah and he had finally matured to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">physical stature he could ride the bike</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">so four preconditions are there happy</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">days he&#39;s learning</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">on his own he&#39;s coaching me more than</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">i&#39;m coaching him</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">but we then reach a critical juncture</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">whereby</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">when he tries to speed up he&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.120" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">correcting with his handlebars causing</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">him to swerve</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">and fall now i allow him to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">work through this but i start to notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">in the morning he&#39;s not as excited to</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">get on the bike</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">right right right he&#39;s not his he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">as quick he in fact might even push</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">back oh hey buddy you want to go ride</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">and so what do i start to notice oh well</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">i start to draw a possible correlation</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">between him reaching this this</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">this progress gap and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">his motivation his desire and so that as</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">a coach</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">brings in an interesting point when</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">failure reaches a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">and frustration follows we start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">possibly see a reduction in desire</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not that the goal is gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">still there</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">gravity hasn&#39;t gone anywhere and he</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">hasn&#39;t lost his strength overnight</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">so in his case i saw it as desire so i</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">said okay so my my job now</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">is to go in and see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">in in provoke desire but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:53.440" style="s2">by motivating him because that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:56.080" style="s2">working john i said hey come on buddy</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.440" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">did not work okay i&#39;m scratching my head</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">well how do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">i can&#39;t change the goal ah feedback</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">what he&#39;s suffering from is he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">aware of the feature of his environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">that contains the information needed</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">to make the progress towards his goal</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">that he desires</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">okay okay where&#39;s that information</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">the information for me was in his</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">handlebars the motion of his handlebars</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">is what was ultimately causing the thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">that was causing his desire to erode</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">and so i step in now we&#39;re a musical</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">and i i gave him a very simple question</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">i said madden</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:40.320" style="s2">show me what your handlebars are doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">when they&#39;re loud</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.320" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">and he kind of looked at me and he moved</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">his handlebars very very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">in a big exaggerated motion and i said</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">show me what your handlebars are doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:50.799" style="s2">when they&#39;re quiet</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">and all of a sudden he stopped and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.799" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">held him still very proud of himself</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.799" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">i said okay now when you&#39;re speeding up</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">to catch your sister</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">do you think you should keep your</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">handlebars loud or quiet</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">he looked at me the victim said quiet so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">he&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">right and he&#39;s getting the analogy he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">the comparison right all the while what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">i&#39;m doing is i&#39;m drawing his attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">to the handlebars right but i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">where the handlebars don&#39;t become all</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">consuming</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t become the only focus i</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">believe you use the term they become a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:28.799" style="s2">soft</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">focus the background rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.799" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">foreground</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">and so now we created a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">for when he was writing to either you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">know affirmed himself</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">keep it quiet or for dad to say or mom</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">keep it quiet and i&#39;m not saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">but within a few days he was speeding</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">past his sister</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">uphill down the hills and he was</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">corrected and in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">example i find the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">of coaching really it&#39;s knowing when to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">in it&#39;s knowing what we are stepping</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:04.080" style="s2">into in terms of the change</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">but then here&#39;s the kicker it&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.080" end="00:24:08.799" style="s2">how yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:10.480" style="s2">yeah how to generate the change such</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.799" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">that the learner</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">feels that they&#39;re almost the author of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">that that was beautifully set that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">beautifully said</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">and so can we zero in now</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">on like i want to really zero in on like</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">this this that you know i i get it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.360" style="s2">there&#39;s this kairos right you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:30.559" style="s2">you&#39;re sensing like when&#39;s the time to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.360" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">intervene and</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.559" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">what&#39;s the context of the intervention</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">you really have to sensitize yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">the greeks had a great word for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">they have two words for wisdom one is</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">sophia the other is from</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">and from this is exactly that wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">like when should i intervene and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here you know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">contextual sensitivity that</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">gives you the optimal point of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">intervention right the finesse</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">that pascal talked about right like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s continuous like it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">although i&#39;m using two words but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">that zeroing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.200" style="s2">and the intervention it seems to me like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s continuous or at least it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">dialogue with this process</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">of an emerging right analogy of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s more than just i i granted</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">you use the word analogy and it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">but i i i want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s something more like it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:26.559" style="s2">an enacted analogy it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not this but it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.559" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">people are doing when they&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">ritual</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">in a religious practice right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">not just they&#39;re not just thinking of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:36.799" style="s2">they&#39;re enacting it and they&#39;re enacting</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">it by committing themselves to a process</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.799" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">of transformation within it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">right and so you have to get you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">you have to get that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">of the kairos and then you have to come</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">up with the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">that the per that&#39;s going to catch the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.039" style="s2">person that they&#39;re going to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">right that they&#39;re going to enact right</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.039" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to commit themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:54.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">and i mean so there&#39;s an amazing art</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.799" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">there and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.440" style="s2">i&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">it seems to me like you&#39;ve zeroed in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">on how this language this</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">this i wish i had a better term but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">enacted analogies</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">right how they are bridging</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">between the propositional the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">and the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">like you&#39;re it&#39;s clear to your son your</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">son had the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">right like because soon as you asked him</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">he he knew</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">he knew but there was it was almost like</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">the like metaphor bridging it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">like the connection</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">what you did is right he&#39;s got this he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">got this and this and this and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:42.240" style="s2">cognitive science literature</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">you did problem finding you found the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.240" end="00:26:45.760" style="s2">you found the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">you know how to connect these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.760" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">that are not yet connected</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">and then you gave him an enacted analogy</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">that somehow puts the procedural and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">perspective on the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">altogether</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">in a way and he can commit himself to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">right away</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">and so the interesting thing for me is</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">like again i know i&#39;ve asked you this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">before and it&#39;s an unfair question</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s an unfair question but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">question between friends and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more of an invitation to more</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">like how do you do that like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">going on i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">uh right uh because i think and and to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">be fair to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">not and i&#39;m not trying to put you in a i</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">like you a lot i&#39;m not trying to put you</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">in a heart</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">a bad spot but you did say and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">i&#39;m calling to you on that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">want to transfer this you want to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">want to learn how to take this</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">and make it available for responding to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">the meeting crisis so this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">to my mind like the key question and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">again this is a socratic question i</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t expect people to say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">here it is here&#39;s the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">but maybe by getting into discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:51.200" style="s2">can induce we can draw out</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">so i think we started to get into uh to</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">the schema</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">i i am starting to formulate and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">the schema</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">in the book so so it is a first it is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:01.919" style="s2">first attempt</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">and so so a number of things here i want</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.919" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">to kind of start</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">at one thousand of you that will go to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">the hundreds of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">yeah and so the thousand foot view i</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:12.880" style="s2">actually believe it was during</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">our our panel discussion it was one</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.880" end="00:28:15.760" style="s2">thing that i know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">stood out in my mind because i never</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.760" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">said it before which is why i love these</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">kind of dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">audio complications for me that the flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">state that emerges allows some of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">thinking and code generation but</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">what i said there is is analogies</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">almost by their very nature allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">with your former selves yeah yeah i like</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">i liked i i really</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.039" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">liked that that that linkage to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">right and and distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">across time</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">yeah exactly and the reason i</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">thought of that again by analogy</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">is because when people said well why you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">know many people write a book</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:00.159" style="s2">and they say he&#39;ll never do it again but</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">when people say well i do it again i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.159" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">like i will do it for the rest of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.679" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">right exactly they&#39;re like why why</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.679" end="00:29:11.279" style="s2">i&#39;m like because i realized writing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">allows me to collaborate with myself</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.279" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">every time i finish uh a draft</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">and i set it down and i go away for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">couple weeks and i come back</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">i&#39;m like what was i thinking it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">like i&#39;m reading someone else&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.640" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">each time i went back i found the voice</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">was getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">closer and closer to the one i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">the one i was aspiring towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">and so that thought was already floating</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.320" style="s2">in my mind so when we&#39;re on the panel</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">like holy smokes</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.320" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s what analogies are</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">they&#39;re a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">because analogy right it&#39;s a comparison</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">between something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">familiar with and usually something</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">you&#39;re less familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">not that you you can form analogies</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">between two familiar things but normally</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">in a teaching context i use an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">because i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.080" style="s2">the thing i&#39;m gonna say is something</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.080" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna take your knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">that familiarity and your implicit</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">understanding of that thing and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">going to map it onto this thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">not familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">and with that you carry the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">the structure the schema so</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">one i&#39;ve used last time we spoke an</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.320" style="s2">analogy we use in sprinting</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve all seen people sprint the person</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">that kind of looks hunched over when</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">they&#39;re running almost falls on their</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.760" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">right no we use the analogy of when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">get off the line</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">and for people watching listening</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">imagine usain bolt you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">gun goes off bam and he sprints forward</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">we say</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">drive off the line like a jet taking off</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">nobody consumes that analogy and says</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">i am now physically my matter has</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">changed into a jet</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">but are there are there characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">that we can map</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">well low to high is a is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">characteristic of motion</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.840" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">a very fast characteristic of motion</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">a strong position from toe to tail</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">right or from nose to tail and from head</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">to toe right so strong</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">and so there&#39;s all these features that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">we can map over</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:15.840" style="s2">and so for me very early on it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.840" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">feature mapping and we talked that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:23.039" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:26.080" style="s2">deidre gentner yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.039" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">structure structure mapping her work</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.080" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">really inspired a lot of my own so you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">how do i go about generating analogies</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">and you&#39;re not the only one to ask this</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">i i get asked it all the time and i try</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">to tell people to be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">that this is not something that i feel i</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">was naturally</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">attuned for okay i i would not say if i</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">go back and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">the nick 12 years ago was i using</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">analogies</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">as fluently as i am now as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">as i am not even close and so something</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">the first thing that happened is i</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:07.880" style="s2">recognized</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:11.760" style="s2">right the invisible became visible i</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.880" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">recognized that language was important</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.760" end="00:32:17.440" style="s2">and this specific attribute</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">feature of language that we call analogy</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.440" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">exceptionally important right right</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">the way i would argue that if you listen</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:27.519" style="s2">if you recorded a conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">yourself and a five-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.519" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">a 15 year old a 25 year old and a 50</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">year old</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.880" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">that obviously the concepts you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">talking about are different but if we</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">just look at the structure of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.679" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">i&#39;d argue that the analogy used</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">and the kind of analogy use you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">using is going to be very different and</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to be different</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">based on the age of the person thus only</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">using analogies that they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">experiences they could relate to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">and obviously analogies that you feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">will somehow connect to them</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">as an individual independent of their</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">age and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">i started to notice this and at first</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">it was like brute force let me just let</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">me try to generate more</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">but i kept running into these blockages</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.159" style="s2">and so when you&#39;re when you&#39;re coaching</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.679" style="s2">professional athletes you can&#39;t sit</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.159" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">there and say hey can i have a 10 minute</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.679" end="00:33:18.159" style="s2">intermission</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">to come up with some better cues to give</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.159" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">you that you can move faster over 10</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">10 yards not going to happen and so let</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:27.200" style="s2">me fast forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">to today where i got to and so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">started with</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">deidre gentner&#39;s work and she talks</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">about from a mapping perspective let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.320" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">stick with my analogy</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:37.039" style="s2">because hopefully people can visualize</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">the sprinting and a jet taking off</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.039" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">right right right he talks about two</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">things being mapped</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">we map actions and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">map attributes yeah and so generally</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">speaking the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">in reading her work i took this in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">movement context</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">and this is where john i i feel we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">within this conversation and the ones</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">that will follow</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">we can start to then transcend movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">and bring this analogy into</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">the world of concepts beyond movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">but actions and attributes</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">actions i took that as dynamic it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">feature of the movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:14.480" style="s2">that if my leg can be in position a and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.480" end="00:34:17.839" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at how it moves from a to b</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to call</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">action and an attribute is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">a static it&#39;s a feature of the body so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">if i was to make the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">during a push-up keep your back flat</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">like a table</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">i&#39;m taking static flatness of a table</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m mapping it on to what should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">the static flatness</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">of your back in a push-up that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">attribute but if i say</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">when you change direction explode off</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">the ground</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">like a bouncy ball off the ground i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">invoking something of more of an</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">action there&#39;s a speed motion element to</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:56.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">and so what i started to realize is okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.800" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">when i&#39;m coaching</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">i need to identify is the thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">categorically a action</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">a dynamic motion or</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">is it an attribute so is it an attribute</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">of the body</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">they&#39;re flexed and they should be</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">neutral or</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">an action their leg needs to come up</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">faster than it is right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">once i&#39;ve identified that then i can say</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">okay that means i&#39;ve identified the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">thing that i need to change</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.800" style="s2">now how do i go about doing that i have</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">to identify an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.800" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">using language using experiences they</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">familiar with and so to summarize the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">schema</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">if i can identify the feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:46.400" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">and make sure the feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.400" end="00:35:50.960" style="s2">movement is similar to the thing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">analogizing it against</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:54.800" style="s2">and that the thing i&#39;m analogizing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">against is familiar</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.800" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">right to you john you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">reference i&#39;m making you know about</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:03.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen a jet take off</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve presumably seen a table so sprint</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.440" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">like a jet taking off</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">lands with you if we look at that then</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">that starts to generate</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">if you would an engine for pulling on</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">all the things that they&#39;re familiar</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">with that have this attribute or all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">things they&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">that have this action in its simplest</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s how i approach it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:27.359" style="s2">fantastic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">very uh your talent for exploitation is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">uh very much appreciated by me um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m also very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">gentner&#39;s work i teach it and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">courses i teach on thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve done work on metaphor a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">on metaphor analogy</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">so i i want to bring those things to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">and see if that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">will enrich the discussion uh so gentner</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">um uh also talks about well</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:53.119" style="s2">before we go to gentner let&#39;s go to our</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">tony uh or tony has the uh a salience</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.119" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">imbalance theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">of metaphor every theory of metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">ultimately fails from counter examples</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">none of these theories will be</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">definitional but they&#39;re all helpful</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all helpful</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">and so what ortoni says is uh so uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">you know here&#39;s here&#39;s the target of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">metaphor this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">what i want to understand and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">vehicle of the metaphor what i</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">what i&#39;m familiar with and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">transfer from the vehicle to the target</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">just so we have some language to talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">and then what he says is what what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:25.839" style="s2">do is you find a feature</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">in the vehicle that is highly that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.839" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">regularly salient</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">for the vehicle and then what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">you map it on to a feature that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">regularly not salient for the target</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">so you find a salience imbalance and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">then by doing that mapping what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">i would say is you that&#39;s why it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">an aha experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">you&#39;re altering what you find salient</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">and thereby what you find relevant</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">and so it seems to me that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:53.839" style="s2">things you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">is you like i&#39;m trying to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.839" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">you something</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">like he had this information but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">wasn&#39;t salient to him</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">and then you used and then use the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">feature of music that&#39;s very sailing to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">music it&#39;s loud or it&#39;s soft</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">and then what that did is it took this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">non-salient feature</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">and made it more salient so that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">like it plugs into your</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">example the salience imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:19.119" style="s2">absolutely going in the next edition i</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">love that you&#39;re 100 right</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.119" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">otherwise they would have changed it</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">themselves yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">exactly exactly so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">like when you have an inside experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">the information&#39;s available to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">like the nine dot you know problem well</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">you always knew that there was space</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">outside the nine dots</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">but it wasn&#39;t salient to you wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">relevant to you right away and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">now bringing in an idea from getting her</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">so gentner talks a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">like she has she has a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">step-by-step</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">decision tree for how you decide what to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">map</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">and she says you you map like you map</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">you prefer relations over uh single</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">and you you prefer systems of relations</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">single relations so that&#39;s why we like</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">that the the you know the atom is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">solar system uh because we can map</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">not only can we map a bunch of relations</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:09.760" style="s2">we can map a relation between all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">relations</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.760" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">she calls that systematicity and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">that what&#39;s also going on in your</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">selection and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">the artistry of it and i mean that as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">compliment by the way the artist</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">is that you&#39;re trying to find not just</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">the features but you&#39;re trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">the structural functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">of the features</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">that will so one of the things the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">metaphor does the analogy does</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not just giving them a feature list</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like i mean your work like</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s giving them a feature schema it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">giving them</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.680" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">right not only the features but implicit</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">in the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">is how the features are all fitted</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">together and are working</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">together so for example you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">feature of acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:57.359" style="s2">and a slow thing but you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">you you know you might give</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">you might you might have one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">has one other like a rocket</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have the other feature</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:04.880" style="s2">right and right you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">something that they put</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.880" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">that that sort of gestalts them together</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">there&#39;s that systematicity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a structural functional relation</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering if um</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">if if what happens is do you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">like are there some cis are there some</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">situ like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">i&#39;m asking a calibration question sorry</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:28.319" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">the idea is let&#39;s say like the more</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.319" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">and dynamically complex the needed</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">intervention do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">find that the metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">correspondingly has sort of a richer</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:41.760" style="s2">systematicity to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:43.200" style="s2">that it like you feel that the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.760" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">metaphor is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.200" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">richer or denser uh a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">i i i don&#39;t i i&#39;d have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">that that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">that description of it has not crossed</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">my mind from the standpoint of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">the use of of metaphor or analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.760" style="s2">a complex versus let&#39;s say a less</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">complex problem right</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.760" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">right in fact what i find is the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">complex the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">the the easier it is to find an</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">aha yeah buy a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">because and i kind of call this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">trojan horse effect</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">right you talk about all the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">meaning i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">hide i can hide a ton</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">of implicit meaning and a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">relational meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">inside of an analogy but if i was to</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">and make it explicit to to to allow</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">the warriors out of the trojan horse so</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:46.960" style="s2">to speak</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">then it would dominate it would create</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.960" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">chaos in my mind i get it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">leading the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">ineffectual if i can</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2">highlight something that that you said</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">earlier because i think it it&#39;ll add</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">brightness to it you talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">salience imbalance which i love</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">and just to put in my own words the so</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">to speak that the vehicle the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">they are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">that i&#39;m mapping on to the target the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">thing i&#39;m trying to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.000" style="s2">or change i like the primacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">is that that the thing part of it that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">need them to be aware of is obvious it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">inherent inside of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">yeah yeah and the thing i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">change which has a similarity</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">is not so that&#39;s salience i love that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">what i find though inside of that is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">more the two things i&#39;m comparing</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">map on to each other and and gentler</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">the less the less impactful</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.160" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">because that that one</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say salient feature that i really</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">want to stand out</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">in the vehicle that i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">stand out in the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">sometimes can be dampened by all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">other points of familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">and so they can&#39;t find it and so let me</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">give an example that&#39;s the first time</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve said this the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:13.560" style="s2">the sprint like a jet taking off right</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">right by itself</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.560" end="00:43:20.400" style="s2">oftentimes is</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">ineffective right right here&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.400" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">here&#39;s why in my</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:24.880" style="s2">opinion i just want to say you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:26.560" style="s2">asking you&#39;re really answering the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.880" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">question about calibration that i asked</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.560" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">oh okay you really are just go just go</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">so the reason the jet is ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">is because there are too many obvious</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">features</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">that map onto sprinting you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">fast you can talk about again from</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">from you know nose to tail it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">be straight</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">well if you look at the side of the body</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">it needs to be straight so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like when there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">of features that map onto each other</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">the person abandons ship conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">because they don&#39;t one doesn&#39;t stand out</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">so i always</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">i oh like you get a bag of peanuts right</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">maybe not anymore but i give them a bag</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.720" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">of peanuts as well on this jet</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">i say listen i need you to explode off</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">the line like a jet taking off</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:17.440" style="s2">gradually rising so i try to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">to the salient</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.440" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">of the gradual rise of the jet</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s the piece i want them to map</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">over let me give an example of an</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">that the salience is obvious like you</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:32.079" style="s2">don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t need any</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:33.359" style="s2">translation because what i did there</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.079" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">were some analogies there&#39;s a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">translation</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">this one doesn&#39;t require if i say i want</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">you to line up</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">for your sprint okay and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">imagine i used to work in phoenix</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">arizona so desert landscape</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">context will allow this analogy to make</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">more sense right right right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">i want you to imagine there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">rattlesnake</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">two feet behind you reared up</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">ready to bite your calf</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">i need you to beat the bite beat the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">bunt</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">and so again inherent inside of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">the i&#39;m almost making explicit</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">the comparison but i think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">revealing</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">with analogy as well is the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.560" style="s2">collaborating with a former state</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">is the the knowledge of what getting off</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.560" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">the line fast that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">but what does the analogy also give me</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">it gives me an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">quality right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense embedded in that analogy</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">how to do this i&#39;m not just gradually</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">getting off the line</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">i literally am getting off the line like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">my life depends on it</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not only brightening the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">technique</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">it&#39;s brightening the the the energy the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">heartbeat of the temperature</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.920" style="s2">and so much of movement so much of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.920" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">has a feel has an emotional quality you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">talk to athletes</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">they talk about feeling in the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">energy fluxes yet so much of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">in coaching lacks that emotional quality</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">we say</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">extend this push that rotate there</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">but that as if that&#39;s enough it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">to actually help someone wholesale</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">embody a change</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">so that&#39;s really interesting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">powerful uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">so so there is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">there is a kind of logos there there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">a structural functional organization but</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">what you did was really interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">said it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">not so much just between features but</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">also between</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">sort of different aspects or functions</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">are all you&#39;re also organizing them with</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">the analogy so you&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.319" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">right knowledge of how to you know move</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:51.839" style="s2">their body</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">but you that what what the thing the me</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">the analogy is doing is actually putting</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">them into an emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s giving them a perspective and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:01.280" style="s2">motivation right</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.280" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">that&#39;s really really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">so i just want to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">another point that was touched on</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:11.520" style="s2">briefly and this is some of the work</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.520" end="00:47:14.720" style="s2">my colleague dan chappie has done</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">experimental work on</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.720" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">so you don&#39;t you don&#39;t really i mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">people talk about metaphorical truth</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s truth more like in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">allothea a metaphor is true to or</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.920" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">analogy is true to the greek which it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.119" style="s2">brings about a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">that connects you to the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.119" end="00:47:32.559" style="s2">better way right um</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not true the way like f you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.559" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">force equals mass times acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">or something like that but so but what</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">what you do evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">metaphors on so so the thing that stands</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">in for is it true or false because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">actually talking about transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.119" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">not not possession of proposition right</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">what stands in for truth is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">called aptness</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">like if how apt a metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about uh the</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">aptness of a metaphor and i want to see</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">if this translates back to your</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">so and there&#39;s experimental work showing</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">this and you brought it up with</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">you know gettinger&#39;s point and other</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">people have noted it</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">you know if the vehicle and the tenor</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">are too similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">you get all these mappings but as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">said you don&#39;t know which one is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">simulator or the relevant one</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">and so yeah so let me give you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">an example i use it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.559" style="s2">for my own work in my lectures uh if if</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">the tenor</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.559" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">if the target in the vehicle are too</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:29.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t get a you don&#39;t get a great</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">metaphor even though you&#39;re getting tons</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.040" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.280" style="s2">so if i say to you bees are hornets you</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">don&#39;t go wow</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s such a great metaphor let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">at all the mappings in it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">because so many things are familiar you</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.040" style="s2">how to reorganize what you find salient</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.040" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">and then on the other extreme is if</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">they&#39;re if they&#39;re too different</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">the identity becomes so abstract</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">that it you&#39;re it&#39;s vague about what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">transformation is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">well when i say to you well you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2">arguments are chairs</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">because they&#39;re both human-made and</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.200" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">they&#39;re structures that support</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a great metaphor and you go</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">what that what like what</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">what what about chairs right and so and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.000" style="s2">so people don&#39;t like either one of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">extremes</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.000" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">and so this aptness you&#39;ve got to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">what&#39;s there&#39;s a duality to it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">right you have to get</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">both a relevant difference and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">backgrounded and then a relevant</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">sameness</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s foregrounded did that did did</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">that make did that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">well my slight deviation in uh in</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">eyes here is because i want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">connection that i feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">is is right into your episode 12.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">you went through this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">you know trustworthiness something</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">elegant doesn&#39;t make it fluid</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:57.920" style="s2">is it trivial is it far-fetched exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">yeah i think when you said you know when</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.920" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">something is uh let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">profound is like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">optimization of it&#39;s trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s elegant in its in in its</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">simplicity to explain</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s fluent right we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">take no energy</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">to understand it and almost for me that</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.119" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">that profound</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">sense that ah ha it is this i i can</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">trust it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s elegant in its simplicity and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.119" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">fluid it takes it takes no effort to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.119" end="00:50:29.520" style="s2">to be brought on board i don&#39;t know as</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.520" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">that no no that&#39;s good yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">yeah no i like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">oh that yeah okay so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">right there there&#39;s so coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">front coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">vehicle there&#39;s a lot of familiar lines</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">and then they converge on the needed</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">thing the central thing and then that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">the nexus point that&#39;s the point that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">gives you maximal intervention</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">right and when you write oh that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">that&#39;s really good and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">you have to strike oh i like that i</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.200" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">hadn&#39;t put that together</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">nick that&#39;s brilliant i didn&#39;t quit</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:03.200" style="s2">quickly but i knew you yeah because when</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">you went through</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:09.040" style="s2">what makes something you know uh trivial</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">a lot of convergence with no elegance</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">you know far fetched elegance</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">with little convergence my mind&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:18.319" style="s2">okay he is starting to ex</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:20.960" style="s2">because for me i&#39;m nearly obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.319" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">how to be a better thinker you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.960" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">world of noise</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">how do we find signal yeah but almost as</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">an analogy that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">how can we communicate in a way to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:34.000" style="s2">brighten the right signals</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s what good metaphor is about so so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.000" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">yeah and i i even use metaphors when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.920" style="s2">talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">because i talk about the elegance of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.920" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">construct as being multi-opt</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">right because it maps into many</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">different uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">many different domains but that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:51.920" style="s2">good i like that so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:53.440" style="s2">that what i&#39;m looking for is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.920" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">maybe we can put the two things together</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.440" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">a good analogy</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">is one that&#39;s going to generate that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">right uh in a powerful way um</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">and and it&#39;s going to cause a salient a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">a a significant restructuring of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">salience of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">of the target is that that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:13.599" style="s2">aha</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of yeah a generated</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.599" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">plausibility that generates a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">on aha because of right so you tr</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">the trustworthiness makes you trust the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">the salience imbalance right and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">change how you think about something</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">but the elegance is what gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">sense of it empowering you</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s really good i hadn&#39;t thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">about that those that putting those two</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">together i think is very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">yeah yeah no for me it&#39;s you know i find</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.559" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">so so much of this hangs on their</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">their deep familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">the vehicle yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">i i&#39;m i&#39;m working with uh you know an</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">athlete right now</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">who has been been trying to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">problem he just so happens to work in</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">golf and he&#39;s been working at this for a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">long time</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">right and so what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.640" style="s2">and this is almost uh how do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">mechanize this</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:18.480" style="s2">again in movement coaching but also you</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:21.520" style="s2">know i think there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.480" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">therapeutic exemplars for using metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.520" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">metaphor and analogy to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">transcend your circumstances to listen</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">to the words we are using the you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;m underwater you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:34.800" style="s2">trained to the ground whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.960" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">be so almost i was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.800" end="00:53:38.720" style="s2">to steal a little bit of that intellect</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.800" style="s2">into this process and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">my steps with him have been as follows</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.800" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">step one</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">before we can even talk about analogy or</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">metaphor generation</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">we need to clearly understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.200" style="s2">feature</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">that it we&#39;re trying to target the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.200" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">feature that we are trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">a lot of time with him let&#39;s unpack in</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">your movement</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">what needs to change right and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">taken a couple conversations and even</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">for for the individual for them to try</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">to unpack it because</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve been of many minds but once we</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">nailed it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">then it was a very simple task i said</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:19.040" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">what visual</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.040" end="00:54:25.760" style="s2">and this is an analogy what visual</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:29.680" style="s2">can you can occupy your mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.760" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">that you feel by its very nature</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.680" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">would force upon a change right and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">very clear when i say this</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">and i i don&#39;t want you to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">change is one of intellectual knowing</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">that okay these things propositionally</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:44.319" style="s2">go together if i think this that should</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.680" end="00:54:46.480" style="s2">happen no</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.319" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">that when you think of this thing you</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.480" end="00:54:49.839" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">the change right right right right get</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.839" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">it i got it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">okay and so i look at that as they</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:54:58.640" style="s2">download</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">the implicit meaning of the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.640" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">on contact right it takes no effort it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">completely fluent</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">in many cases with maybe a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">translation and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">basically i armed him with the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">schema</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">so to speak and after a couple sessions</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">guess what he found it he found one and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">and now it&#39;s a matter of grooving it in</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">now i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s perfect we might</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:25.440" style="s2">have to pivot a little bit but we are</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">we are building the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.440" end="00:55:29.119" style="s2">right why do i say we&#39;re building the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:33.440" style="s2">analogy because</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.119" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">if i am golfing i am golfing that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.440" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">the skill i can&#39;t transcend that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">i&#39;m swinging a club and hitting a ball</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">to to transcend that and thus bring</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">something new to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">it&#39;s not like i can change the rules of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">the game either</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">right right right i can&#39;t bring anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">outside of me</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">ah but i have this virtual thing where i</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.359" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">move as if right right right the big</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:02.319" style="s2">if i move as if i feel this if i move as</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">if i</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.319" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">were there on a cliff let&#39;s say all of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">sudden</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">my movement organizes differently and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">for me this is this is kind of that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">process that we go through</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:17.280" style="s2">and so oftentimes an analogy isn&#39;t a one</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">and done</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.280" end="00:56:20.880" style="s2">for me early on that was the case but</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">now i talked about</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.880" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">a working analogy yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like like almost like i saw it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was trying to convey with</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">the poetry of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">yeah yeah right it keeps building yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:36.160" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:39.040" style="s2">yeah and even the the even if we abandon</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.160" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">the the structure of an analogy which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.040" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">to say it&#39;s words</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">oftentimes we still contain the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:48.640" style="s2">and we transfer the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">to a different structure which might be</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.640" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">a comparison that is more salient a</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">comparison</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">that they are more familiar with that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:58.559" style="s2">they like better</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">and so for example i might say to an</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.559" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">when they&#39;re sprinting hey i want you to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">explode off the ground like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:07.440" style="s2">sprinting up a set of stairs</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">and so the meaning i&#39;m trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.440" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">is more push into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">with upward forward propulsion but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">say that&#39;s not working for them</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">but i haven&#39;t they understand what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:21.280" style="s2">trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s not affecting them the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.280" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">on them and so now let&#39;s say i change</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">okay instead of sprinting up</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">stairs imagine you&#39;re sprinting up a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">hill</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:36.160" style="s2">right okay it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">forward upward propulsion but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.160" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">different visual context</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">so i have some people the hill</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">absolutely lights them up they get it it</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">instant change other people it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">stairs right right</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">right as long as we get the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">right the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">the wrapping the coat of paint the words</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">the exemplar we use</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">to contain that meaning that can change</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">a deeper way to suggest how i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">a working analogy once we get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">meaning right</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:07.520" style="s2">then we just got to find the packaging</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">to get it to hit</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">so i noticed that um like</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">when you&#39;re explaining a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">examples the movement</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">seems to be like that you put people</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">you trigger their perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">and even some participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">right and then that&#39;s what you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">to try and train</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">uh like you know transform the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">procedural knowing like when you said</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">you know swing your golf club as if</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">you&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">a cliff right like i got you get you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.640" style="s2">immediately get the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">right and then all all the implicit</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.640" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">right for in that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:43.760" style="s2">right what right and then you you bought</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">you start to assume a particular</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.760" end="00:58:47.359" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:49.119" style="s2">you embody right and then that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:51.920" style="s2">triggers which skill set</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.119" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">is going to be available to you is it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.920" end="00:58:54.319" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.319" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">is it or even like even like you said</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.319" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">when you&#39;re doing push-ups</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">you said you know you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">telling the person be it</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">be a table and what would it be like to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">be a table kind of thing right</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">uh there&#39;s so there&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">identification</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:11.359" style="s2">that&#39;s going on a perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">transformation nick are you still there</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.359" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">i am here yes yeah you&#39;re frozen there</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:17.040" style="s2">for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">uh just wanted to make sure so i mean is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.040" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">that is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:21.440" style="s2">is that prototypical are you almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">always</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.440" end="00:59:25.119" style="s2">like uh like putting people into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.119" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">identity within a particular perspective</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:33.760" style="s2">and then they use that to transform</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">uh the procedural knowing it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.760" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">a hundred percent so so here let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">your cliff</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">example you you you unlock something</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">i&#39;m always interested when people say</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">implicit knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s knowing without telling i even</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:53.200" style="s2">though i conceptually understand that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">i still struggle with this goal how can</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.200" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">you know something</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">if you can&#39;t verbalize it well you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">you can enact it you can act it out you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.760" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">move as if yeah and so take the cliff</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">the cliff example where does the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">information come from well the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">information comes from as you said</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:15.200" style="s2">that direct perception right you are</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.200" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">almost embody an act in the mind if i</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">were on a cliff</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">there are certain things i could not</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">would not do</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">you know i would not want to lean back</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:29.520" style="s2">i probably am going to have more of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">forward-shifted</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.520" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">posture i might even be aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:34.319" style="s2">wind so it might stiffen me up through</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">the middle</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">and these are not things that i have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">propositionally think about</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">these are things that i instantly feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">and this is that this is that pursuit we</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:47.200" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">words to the degree that they get you</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.200" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">and so what you&#39;ve said there is we use</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">to literally cue to cue a memory state</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">that allows you to step into that memory</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">state and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">what would it be like yes answering and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">answering</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:07.520" style="s2">what would it be like that&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.520" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">i need you to carry into the present</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">and that by definition for me would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">the implicit</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">knowing the feeling you appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">from the analogy into the present world</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">you turn</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">virtual into the real that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:29.200" style="s2">powerful that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">very powerful so so this th this enacted</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.200" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">poetry</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">i like that better than an active</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">analogy because it because poesis means</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">right right yeah so so this</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">this enacted poesis right uh maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s even better</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:44.559" style="s2">because it captures all of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">different things i wanted to say earlier</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.559" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">in one term</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">so this enacted poesis it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">powerful way</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">right of of getting people to</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.280" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">like instead of top down from their</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">proposition they&#39;re going sort of bottom</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:01:59.760" style="s2">up from</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">the identities they assume the agent</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.760" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">arena identities within a particular</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:06.400" style="s2">perspective of knowing</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">and then that shifts the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.400" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">skills that they&#39;re trying to acquire or</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">the skills that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">transform</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">it reminds me of some of the work i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:13.520" style="s2">been doing the dan chappie about how</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.520" end="01:02:17.039" style="s2">the scientists using the rover on mars</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">and they they have to go through this</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.039" end="01:02:21.119" style="s2">process of identifying with the rover</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">and then that gives them the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.119" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">like look at the pictures and see as if</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:25.920" style="s2">they&#39;re on mars and then they can do the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">field work</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.920" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">they right um which is really really</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">really really interesting thing</p>

<p begin="01:02:46.880" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">uh you know with what people have been</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.960" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">doing and i mentioned it much earlier</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:53.520" style="s2">within really</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">you know within religious ritual right</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.520" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">you people go in</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:58.640" style="s2">what would it be like to be you know you</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.240" end="01:03:09.280" style="s2">that identity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.440" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to adopt the perspective and</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.280" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s actually helping</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">to transform his skills and his virtues</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">so i can see a lot of people listening</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">to what we&#39;re talking about who might</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">have some kind of religious</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:23.599" style="s2">background going yeah and and finding</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">right uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.599" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">a bridging there or and other people who</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">who might be but be hearing it and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:34.319" style="s2">it might be sort of the obverse of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">they might be saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.319" end="01:03:37.039" style="s2">the thing they&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">ability that&#39;s something i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.039" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">hungering for</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">but not in movement or in sport i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:42.400" style="s2">been hungry for that more</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:44.480" style="s2">comprehensively</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.400" end="01:03:46.160" style="s2">and so putting those two together you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.480" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">see where i&#39;m going with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.160" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">talking about here is deeply pregnant</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.319" end="01:03:55.520" style="s2">general issue of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">enabling people and there&#39;s a metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.520" end="01:04:00.000" style="s2">right in the title to awaken from</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">the meeting crisis and what i what i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.000" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">like to do is</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:05.119" style="s2">follow this up and i know you have you</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">know uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.119" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">you know broader philosophical points to</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">make about this you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about the way you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">thinking about you know challenging the</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">cartesian framework and what that means</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">um and so i want to invite you to come</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:19.680" style="s2">back and build upon what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.680" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">here today and you know build it out</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:25.839" style="s2">into those larger</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">uh cognitive cultural issues so that i</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.839" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we could do next time</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:35.039" style="s2">yeah no i i think that&#39;s spot on because</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">since our last discussion you know for</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.039" end="01:04:38.480" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:40.480" style="s2">it has been asking the question okay how</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.480" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">can we extend</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.480" end="01:04:46.559" style="s2">this approach and let&#39;s be clear</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">this is not the first nor the last time</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.559" end="01:04:49.440" style="s2">people will talk about the benefit and</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">the use of metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.440" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">for many many different reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">allowing it to be more accessible more</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">more visible more mainstream</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">is what i see this this journey being so</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">important for but nick you are bringing</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">of metaphor that is not talked about in</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">a lot of the literature of metaphor</p>
