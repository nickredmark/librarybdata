<p begin="00:00:32.899" end="00:00:37.010" style="s2">So today I’m gonna tell you the best three<br />stories that I know, I think, and, I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.010" end="00:00:44.899" style="s2">these stories are absolutely, phenomenally<br />potent, and the reason for that is that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.899" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">think they illustrate in an extraordinarily-powerful<br />way the nature of the processes that led to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:58.510" style="s2">the establishment of western democratic ideals.</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.510" end="00:01:08.500" style="s2">Mircae Eliade, whose work I rely on substantially,<br />to make the following argument, has taken</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.500" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">western academic culture to task in a manner<br />that hasn’t fully been revealed yet.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:20.890" style="s2">He said that, like all human cultures, the<br />west is parochial and narrow in its viewpoint,</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.890" end="00:01:25.310" style="s2">and although over the last three hundred years<br />there’s been a substantial amount of cross-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.310" end="00:01:30.490" style="s2">intermingling and a potential broadening of<br />philosophical and religious horizon, that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.490" end="00:01:39.910" style="s2">broadening has not been sufficiently complete;</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.910" end="00:01:45.179" style="s2">If we build on the viewpoint that I’ve been<br />developing with you over the last few courses</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.179" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">and make the presupposition that religious<br />modes of thinking are more phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.280" style="s2">than they are rational, which means that they<br />deal more with what you experience, say, than</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.280" end="00:01:59.000" style="s2">with the objective world, if we look at archaic<br />religious stories through that lens, then</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.000" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">they can start to open up, and so, given that,<br />I want to open up three religious stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:13.750" style="s2">to you today, two in depth, and one only in<br />passing because we’ll return to it later.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.750" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">I’ll start with, Judeo-Christian Myth of<br />Genesis, and when I say myth, of course, you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:25.739" style="s2">all know this already, but when I say myth,<br />I don’t mean untruth, I mean a form of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.739" end="00:02:30.569" style="s2">that’s narrative in structure and predicated<br />on presumptions that aren’t empirical; a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.569" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">myth describes processes of transformation,<br />a myth describes them, a myth describes the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">process whereby elements of experience come<br />into being and transform</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:51.260" style="s2">On Genesis, the fundamental structural elements<br />of Genesis are the Word of God and chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.260" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2">and the Hebrew words for chaos and waste are<br />tehom, for chaos, and tohu, for waste, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.269" end="00:03:03.269" style="s2">tehom in particular, although toho as well,<br />are very interesting words because you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.269" end="00:03:08.980" style="s2">track their derivation historically, and sometimes<br />if you contract the derivation of words historically,</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.980" end="00:03:13.659" style="s2">you can get some sense of the culture milieu<br />out of which the word sprang,</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.659" end="00:03:19.249" style="s2">and we know what tyomat means because we have<br />written records of a story that involves a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.249" end="00:03:24.761" style="s2">character named Tiamat, and Tiamat is a dragon<br />who lives at the bottom of the ocean; in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.761" end="00:03:31.609" style="s2">oldest creation myth we have, which is the<br />Enuma Elish, the Sumerian creation myth, the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.609" end="00:03:44.629" style="s2">Sumeria, Babylon, Acadia, rightly regarded<br />as the birthplace of modern western civilization.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.629" end="00:03:54.950" style="s2">In Genesis, two processes unite to produce<br />being, the first of those processes or states</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.950" end="00:03:59.769" style="s2">is chaos, represented by taom or tohu.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.769" end="00:04:05.430" style="s2">The second of those processes is logos, and<br />logos is another word that has an extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.430" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">broad range of meaning; it’s generally transcribed<br />in the Christian tradition as the word, and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">it’s identified with Christ, which is a<br />very peculiar identification because it’s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">the Word of God that creates order out of<br />chaos and, of course, the Word of God in Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:28.480" style="s2">is a phenomena that predates the birth of<br />Christ infinitely from a classical religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.480" end="00:04:36.740" style="s2">perspective, so the fact that the two beings<br />are identified as of great peculiarity and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">also of great interest.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:45.340" style="s2">The fundamental story of Genesis is something<br />like this, and it’s perhaps the most brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.340" end="00:04:53.800" style="s2">contribution of Judeo-Christian thought to<br />world history, its total impact is virtually</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.800" end="00:04:55.770" style="s2">incalculable.</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.770" end="00:05:00.690" style="s2">The idea is this: that chaos can be conceptualized<br />as something that has an essentially feminine</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:07.270" style="s2">aspect as a matrix, and a matrix is a structure<br />from which other structures emerge, and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.270" end="00:05:12.980" style="s2">story in Genesis makes the hypothesis that<br />logos, which is the Word of God, a phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.980" end="00:05:22.349" style="s2">associated with speech and communication and<br />logic, logos: logic, rationality, courage,</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.349" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">exploration, all combined into a single entity<br />or trait: logos, the combination of logos</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.730" end="00:05:33.080" style="s2">and chaos is what brings order into being;<br />that’s what the story in Genesis means;</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.080" end="00:05:39.960" style="s2">it’s not an empirical description of the<br />origin of objects, it’s a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.960" end="00:05:47.080" style="s2">description of the origin of experience,<br />the idea being that without the piercing glance</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">of whatever consciousness is, whatever the<br />background of experience is, the matrix, chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">cannot be conceptualized as real; it takes<br />the interplay between the feminine principle,</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:06.099" style="s2">chaos, and the masculine principle, logos,<br />in order to produce being.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.099" end="00:06:10.840" style="s2">Now that’s of substantial importance when<br />you give some consideration to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.840" end="00:06:21.760" style="s2">immediately in Genesis, after the establishment<br />of livable order, the deity yahva identifies</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.760" end="00:06:26.819" style="s2">the individual human being with logos, right,<br />made in God’s image, that’s the essential</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.819" end="00:06:32.259" style="s2">characteristic of the human being, and what<br />that means is that the logos that operates</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.259" end="00:06:36.569" style="s2">in human beings, which is this capacity to<br />make order out of chaos, is identical to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.569" end="00:06:41.810" style="s2">principle that gives rise to the cosmos from<br />a mythological perspective, so it partakes</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.810" end="00:06:50.849" style="s2">of the deity in a very direct sense insofar<br />as being itself is dependent on its operation.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.849" end="00:06:57.419" style="s2">Now it’s still possible to claim, given<br />that perspective, that a story with that sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.419" end="00:07:02.349" style="s2">of structure is superstitious and that it<br />doesn’t bear any relationship to what reality,</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.349" end="00:07:07.060" style="s2">what actually constitutes reality, but you<br />have to understand that that story, old as</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.060" end="00:07:12.590" style="s2">it is, is predicated on older stories, and<br />it’s on the ground that those older stories</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.590" end="00:07:18.970" style="s2">establish that our entire concept of natural<br />rights rests, so if you believe that natural</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.970" end="00:07:25.430" style="s2">rights have an existence more than merely<br />arbitrary, the reason you believe that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.430" end="00:07:28.830" style="s2">because they’re predicated, those rights<br />are predicated on the ideas that are expressed</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.830" end="00:07:32.530" style="s2">in these myths,</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.530" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">Okay, so now we’re gonna go back in time<br />to Sumeria, and I’m gonna show you how the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:45.009" style="s2">Sumerian creation myth lays itself out, and<br />not only that, I’m going to describe to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.009" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">you the direct political implications of the<br />Enuma Elish, the Sumerian creation myth, because</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.210" style="s2">the political implications of that myth are<br />well understood because the political structure</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.210" end="00:08:01.180" style="s2">of Sumeria was directly associated with the<br />structure of the myth because the Sumeria</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.180" end="00:08:08.509" style="s2">was regarded as the earthly represent of the<br />highest God in the Mesopotamian Pantheon,</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.509" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">whose name was Marduk, so insofar as you were<br />emperor, the reason that you were emperor,</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:20.219" style="s2">and the, this is what gave your sovereignty<br />legitimacy, right, ‘cause sovereignty has</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.219" end="00:08:23.499" style="s2">to have legitimacy otherwise there’s constant<br />revolutions.</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.499" end="00:08:28.250" style="s2">What gave sovereignty legitimacy in Mesopotamia<br />was the identification of the emperor with</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.250" end="00:08:32.099" style="s2">Marduk, and that had, that had certain implications<br />for the emperor, which we’ll discuss in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.099" end="00:08:33.099" style="s2">some detail</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.099" end="00:08:34.860" style="s2">So the story starts like this.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.860" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">You’ve got this Dragon, Tiamat, and Tiamat<br />is a great primordial beast, who lives at</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">And the ocean is water and water is associated<br />with the primal element in archaic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:08:56.540" style="s2">and I told you, there’s reasons for that<br />already.</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.540" end="00:09:01.270" style="s2">or if you viewed the transformation of deserts<br />as a consequence of rain, you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.270" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">why water would be considered the element<br />that gives life, right, that the element that,</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:09.860" style="s2">that brings life forth, and we know from an<br />evolutionary perspective that that’s accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:14.220" style="s2">And we know that we’re 90 per cent water<br />and so to consider water the primal element</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.220" end="00:09:16.760" style="s2">is no trivial conclusion.</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">No, no less than presuming that the sun is<br />the ultimate source of light, the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:25.130" style="s2">god, because the sun is the ultimate source<br />of life as far as earth, as far as we’re</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.130" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">concerned on earth, right, because it’s<br />the source of all our energy.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">These aren’t stupid concepts, all right.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:35.770" style="s2">So Tiamat is this horrible creature that lurks<br />at the bottom of the primal element, all right.</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.770" end="00:09:37.650" style="s2">Now she has a husband, Apsu.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.650" end="00:09:41.390" style="s2">Now the Mesopotamian creation myth doesn’t<br />say much about Apsu.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.390" end="00:09:44.401" style="s2">We only know that he’s the male consort<br />of the Dragon of Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.401" end="00:09:50.870" style="s2">And we know from reading other sources of<br />mythology that the male consort of the Dragon</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.870" end="00:09:54.890" style="s2">of Chaos generally represents either logos<br />or culture.</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.890" end="00:09:59.980" style="s2">So we’re gonna make the presupposition in<br />this particular case that the husband of Chaos</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.980" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">is Order or Culture, okay, and then the Mesopotamians<br />don’t say much about that, that doesn’t,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:11.940" style="s2">the development of the idea of Apsu or Order<br />or Culture, doesn’t take new force until</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.940" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">the ancient Egyptians and we’ll talk about<br />them today too.</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:20.881" style="s2">Okay so Tiamat and Apsu are locked into a<br />kind of sexual embrace according to the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.881" end="00:10:21.980" style="s2">creation.</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.980" end="00:10:23.230" style="s2">What does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.230" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">It kinda means two things.</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">It means that they’re not really distinguishable<br />because they’re locked into this embrace</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:34.580" style="s2">and it also means that they’re up to something<br />creative because the act of sexual congress</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.580" end="00:10:41.910" style="s2">in mythology is most usefully, is most frequently<br />utilized as representation of something creative</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.910" end="00:10:47.940" style="s2">or as representation of the probability of<br />some new form coming to be, right.</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.940" end="00:10:49.290" style="s2">All right.</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.290" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2">So Apsu and Tiamat are locked into this embrace<br />in a state that other creation myths describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:06.250" style="s2">as egg-like, the Pre-Cosmogonic egg, their<br />intermingling gives rise to the initial state</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.250" end="00:11:11.700" style="s2">of being according to the Sumerians and the<br />initial state of being according to the Sumerians</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.700" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">is characterized by the dominion of the elder<br />gods</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:23.450" style="s2">These gods, being none too bright, make a<br />tremendous amount of racket, doing things.</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.450" end="00:11:27.540" style="s2">Well what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.540" end="00:11:31.070" style="s2">Well it means something like this.</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.070" end="00:11:33.170" style="s2">They make a lot of racket and they cause a<br />lot of trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.170" end="00:11:40.410" style="s2">They make a lot of wind and all of their racket<br />and trouble and wind and activity rouses Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.410" end="00:11:44.020" style="s2">What does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.020" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">Well it means if you do things, you get in<br />trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">It means even if you’re trying to solve<br />problems, you get into trouble because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:54.300" style="s2">solution to a problem tend, tends to generate<br />a whole bunch of new problems, right.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.300" end="00:11:55.690" style="s2">It’s like the Hydra.</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.690" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">So what it means is that it’s more or less<br />fated that any form of activity whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:11.050" style="s2">is likely to produce the threat of catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.050" end="00:12:15.490" style="s2">And of course we’re absolutely keenly aware<br />of that in the modern world because we’re</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.490" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic<br />activity, all of our frenetic motivated activity</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:54.360" style="s2">is producing alterations in the world order<br />such that Nature itself is going to </p>
<p begin="00:12:54.360" end="00:12:58.180" style="s2">be destroyed and eliminate us, right.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.180" end="00:13:00.350" style="s2">That’s classic Sumerian fear.</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.350" end="00:13:03.390" style="s2">Nothing’s changed in the last 5,000 years.</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.390" end="00:13:08.060" style="s2">The Sumerians presumed that once the elder<br />gods where constructed and started moving</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.060" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">around on the planet, that their activity<br />their mindless activity, because remember</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">these aren’t well integrated motivational<br />forces, they’re more like primordial beasts,</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.300" end="00:13:19.300" style="s2">right.</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.300" end="00:13:25.590" style="s2">Their unintegrated activity risks plunging<br />everything back in Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.590" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">Well Tiamat’s the representative of Chaos,<br />this generative Chaos, but so what if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:35.490" style="s2">Sumerians say, “Well the elder gods cause<br />a lot of racket, they move around the planet</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.490" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">and they upset Tiamat,” and she decides<br />that enough is enough and she’s gonna wipe</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:43.640" style="s2">them out.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.640" end="00:13:51.890" style="s2">So she’s sitting at the bottom of the ocean,<br />fuming away, as the elder gods go about their</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.890" end="00:13:58.530" style="s2">business and then they take one step too many<br />and they kill Apsu, who’s her husband.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.530" end="00:14:03.060" style="s2">Now the Sumerian creation myth doesn’t say<br />much about this, but we know that Apsu is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.060" end="00:14:04.840" style="s2">the male consort of Chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.840" end="00:14:06.130" style="s2">That makes him Order.</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.130" end="00:14:10.520" style="s2">So what happens is the elder gods destroy<br />Order itself.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.520" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">They destroy Culture itself and as soon as<br />you destroy Culture, all hell breaks loose</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:16.221" style="s2">and that’s exactly what happens in this<br />Sumerian creation myth.</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.221" end="00:14:23.450" style="s2">So Tiamat emerges, he’s gonna wipe everything<br />out and the world will revert back to its</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.450" end="00:14:26.050" style="s2">primordial, non-existent state.</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.050" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">Now the, all the gods get wind of this and<br />of course they’re just terrified because</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:34.380" style="s2">they know that this thing that gave rise to<br />them, whatever it is, the matrix of being,</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.380" end="00:14:38.850" style="s2">can easily wipe them out at a moment’s notice<br />and so despite the fact that they are transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.850" end="00:14:44.120" style="s2">and immortal and characterized by a certain<br />amount of power, in the face of absolute Chaos,</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.120" end="00:14:45.800" style="s2">they’re insufficient.</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.800" end="00:14:52.310" style="s2">Now this occurrence is extending over a protracted<br />period of time and as the elder gods are threatened,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.310" end="00:14:55.820" style="s2">they’re also breeding and mating and producing<br />new forms.</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.820" end="00:14:59.610" style="s2">And they produce a great, great grandson,<br />whose name is Marduk.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.610" end="00:15:02.180" style="s2">Now Marduk has a lot of very interesting attributes.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.180" end="00:15:06.190" style="s2">So the attributes are described in the Enuma<br />Elish in the following manner, so this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.190" end="00:15:12.100" style="s2">what Marduk’s father sees when his wife,<br />Damkina, gives birth to Marduk.</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.100" end="00:15:17.620" style="s2">“So when he, who’s Marduk’s father,<br />saw his son, he rejoiced, he beamed, his heart</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.620" end="00:15:19.680" style="s2">was filled with joy.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.680" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">He distinguished him and conferred upon him<br />double equality with the gods.”</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:28.870" style="s2">Okay, so that’s that first indication that<br />whatever Marduk represents is something that’s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.870" end="00:15:32.500" style="s2">elevated beyond the normal status of a primordial<br />deity.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.500" end="00:15:36.930" style="s2">“So that he was highly exalted and surpassed<br />them in everything.</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.930" end="00:15:41.980" style="s2">Artfully arranged beyond comprehension were<br />his members, not fit for human understanding,</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.980" end="00:15:46.310" style="s2">hard to look upon, four were his eyes, four<br />were his ears.</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.310" end="00:15:48.890" style="s2">When his lips moved, fired blazed forth.</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.890" end="00:15:53.050" style="s2">Each of his four ears grew large and likewise,<br />his eyes, to see everything.</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.050" end="00:15:55.550" style="s2">He was exalted among gods.</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.550" end="00:15:56.930" style="s2">Surpassing was his form.</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.930" end="00:15:58.600" style="s2">His members were gigantic.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.600" end="00:16:00.220" style="s2">He was surpassing in height.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.220" end="00:16:01.410" style="s2">Mariyutu, Mariyutu.”</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.410" end="00:16:02.920" style="s2">One of his names.</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.920" end="00:16:07.130" style="s2">“Sun of the sun god, the sun god of the<br />gods.”</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.130" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">Okay.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:10.230" style="s2">Complex bit of poetry.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.230" end="00:16:11.230" style="s2">Says a bunch of things.</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.230" end="00:16:17.170" style="s2">It says well whatever Marduk is, is the offspring<br />of the gods.</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.170" end="00:16:19.980" style="s2">Whatever Marduk is, is characterized by heightened<br />awareness.</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.980" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:23.250" style="s2">Because he has four ears and they’re large.</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.250" end="00:16:29.240" style="s2">Whatever Marduk is characterized by is the<br />status that surpasses that of his fathers.</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.240" end="00:16:34.640" style="s2">Whatever he’s characterized by, is associated<br />with the power of speech, real power, because</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.640" end="00:16:37.570" style="s2">when he speaks, fire spurts forth.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.570" end="00:16:41.910" style="s2">Marduk is also huge, but more importantly,<br />he’s associated in this particular poem</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.910" end="00:16:43.420" style="s2">with the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.420" end="00:16:44.510" style="s2">Why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.510" end="00:16:48.720" style="s2">Well the sun dominates consciousness, right,<br />because we’re conscious during the day.</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.720" end="00:16:52.780" style="s2">Most of our brain is visual cortex, so we’re<br />visual creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.780" end="00:16:56.180" style="s2">So when the sun rises is when the day begins.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.180" end="00:17:00.970" style="s2">So Marduk is also associated with whatever<br />deity dominates the day and that’s the deity</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.970" end="00:17:02.050" style="s2">of consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.050" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">And there’s more to the story of the Sun,<br />right, because the Sun is also something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:11.569" style="s2">rises and sets repeatedly and that means that<br />the deity that dominates consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.569" end="00:17:13.949" style="s2">characterized by a cyclical nature.</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.949" end="00:17:15.620" style="s2">That’s a Sun myth.</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.620" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">Sun rises in the morning renewed, as a consequence<br />of fighting a terrible battle in the night</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:24.059" style="s2">with the enemies of everything that’s associated<br />with consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.059" end="00:17:30.740" style="s2">A classic solar myth</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.740" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">So Apsu and Tiamat give rise to the world<br />of the gods.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">The activity of the world of gods reawakens<br />Tiamat, she decides to destroy everything,</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.420" end="00:17:46.550" style="s2">but at that moment the gods give birth to<br />Marduk.</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.550" end="00:17:51.130" style="s2">Now that’s a typical motif which is that<br />the hero’s always born at the time of maximal</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.130" end="00:17:54.830" style="s2">crisis and the reason for that is in part,<br />it’s simple.</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.830" end="00:18:00.100" style="s2">Look, if your culture is dealing well with<br />the forces of the unknown, so that everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.100" end="00:18:05.770" style="s2">is static, but, static but productive, so<br />that problems themselves don’t arise, there’s</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.770" end="00:18:08.830" style="s2">no reason for the hero, right, there’s no<br />reason to confront the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.830" end="00:18:13.770" style="s2">It’s only when crisis beckons that the birth<br />of the hero is necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.770" end="00:18:18.140" style="s2">Marduk constitutes the birth of the hero.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.140" end="00:18:21.350" style="s2">and they say, “Look, you know, we’re in<br />real trouble unless someone goes out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.350" end="00:18:28.600" style="s2">and confronts Tiamat straight on, she’s<br />gonna wipe everything out, it’s a dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:31.050" style="s2">and terrifying job, but somebody has to do<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.050" end="00:18:34.760" style="s2">And Marduk says, “Oh that’s no problem<br />but I got a few rules here and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.760" end="00:18:40.530" style="s2">first rule, I’m in charge from here on forward.”</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.530" end="00:18:43.170" style="s2">What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.170" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">Well these archaic stories are polysemus and,<br />or polysemic in Northrup Frye’s terminology</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:58.030" style="s2">and what that means is that they can be read<br />validly at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously.</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.030" end="00:19:03.960" style="s2">And so one thing it means is that if you take<br />the 2-year-old child who’s essentially under</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:08.140" style="s2">the Dominion of assorted primordial gods and<br />goddesses.</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.140" end="00:19:09.230" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.230" end="00:19:18.310" style="s2">Aggression, fear, panic, and according to<br />Freud, a certain degree of sexual aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.310" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">The child moves from motivated state to domination<br />for motivated state It isn’t until the age</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">of 3 and 4 when, under the pressure applied<br />by the social world and as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:36.300" style="s2">the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which<br />matures throughout childhood and adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.300" end="00:19:41.820" style="s2">and doesn’t reach its final form until perhaps<br />into the early 20s, all of those fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.820" end="00:19:47.660" style="s2">motivational forces start taking on a structured<br />relationship to one another, which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">that once your, as your personality becomes<br />integrated, a single motive force forward</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:20:01.380" style="s2">has to bring all of these underlying motivational<br />systems into some sort of harmonious arrangement.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.380" end="00:20:04.380" style="s2">Okay so let’s, let’s see what the Sumerians<br />are doing here.</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.380" end="00:20:06.490" style="s2">Okay, first of all they’re, they’re doing<br />psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:12.350" style="s2">They’re trying to figure out, given the<br />dominion of the, the elder gods, the indisputable</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.350" end="00:20:16.700" style="s2">dominion of the elder gods, Instincts, who<br />should rule?</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.700" end="00:20:17.700" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.700" end="00:20:19.130" style="s2">What should be in charge?</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">How do you construct a hierarchy of values?</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:28.410" style="s2">And then more complexly, when you integrate<br />a state, which is what the Mesopotamians did,</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.410" end="00:20:31.610" style="s2">right, the first great civilization, what<br />does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.610" end="00:20:39.130" style="s2">The first time hundreds of tribes were hammered<br />into some sort of stable, hierarchical order,</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.130" end="00:20:43.309" style="s2">how do you represent that order?</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">“So Marduk gets his act together, the gods<br />all meet in a huge chamber, they elect him</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:52.570" style="s2">king and then they prepare him for battle.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.570" end="00:20:58.590" style="s2">When the gods, the fathers, beheld the power<br />of his word, they were glad and did homage,</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.590" end="00:21:00.100" style="s2">saying ‘Marduk is king’.</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.100" end="00:21:03.850" style="s2">They bestowed upon him a scepter, a throne<br />and a royal robe.</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:08.530" style="s2">They gave him an irresistable weapon, smiting<br />the enemy saying, ‘Go and cut off the life</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.530" end="00:21:09.530" style="s2">of Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.530" end="00:21:13.260" style="s2">May the winds carry her blood to out-of-the-way<br />places.’</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.260" end="00:21:17.530" style="s2">After the gods, his fathers, had determined<br />the destiny of Marduk, they set him on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.530" end="00:21:21.940" style="s2">road, the way to success and attainment.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.940" end="00:21:28.020" style="s2">So then he goes to the “heart of darkness”<br />so to speak and confronts Tiamat, accuses</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.020" end="00:21:31.720" style="s2">her of treachery and challenges her to battle.</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.720" end="00:21:36.330" style="s2">“When Tiamat heard this, she became like<br />one in a frenzy and lost her reason.</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.330" end="00:21:38.180" style="s2">She cried out loud and furiously.</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.180" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">To the very roots, her two legs shook back<br />and forth.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:45.170" style="s2">She recited an incantation, repeatedly casting<br />her spell.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.170" end="00:21:48.010" style="s2">As for the gods of battle, they sharpened<br />their weapons.</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.010" end="00:21:52.730" style="s2">Tiamat and Marduk, the wisest of the gods,<br />advanced against one another.</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.730" end="00:21:56.440" style="s2">They pressed on into combat and approached<br />for battle.”</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.440" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">Okay, well things don’t go out so well with<br />Tiamat from this point forward.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:06.990" style="s2">The first thing that Marduk does is encapsulate<br />her in a net and I think that’s a really</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.990" end="00:22:11.420" style="s2">interesting metaphor because that’s essentially<br />what human beings do when they encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.420" end="00:22:12.420" style="s2">unknown, right.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.420" end="00:22:19.480" style="s2">They encapsulate it in an explanatory network,<br />so it’s a way of binding up the, the anomaly,</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.480" end="00:22:23.570" style="s2">or the unknown, and giving it a substantive<br />form.</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.570" end="00:22:29.420" style="s2">“Then he cuts her into pieces and then he<br />makes the world out of her pieces.</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.420" end="00:22:36.180" style="s2">In fact one of Marduk’s names is ‘He Who<br />Makes Ingenious Things’ as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.180" end="00:22:37.920" style="s2">of the combat with Tiamat.”</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.920" end="00:22:43.510" style="s2">Now that’s very, very interesting because<br />what it means is that the Sumerians are presenting</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.510" end="00:22:49.270" style="s2">in metaphorical form the notion that when<br />the chips are down, the survival of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.270" end="00:22:54.580" style="s2">depends on the capacity of whatever Marduk<br />represents, the solar god, to encounter the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.580" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">matrix of being, to cut it into pieces and<br />to make the world and if you think about in</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:01.910" style="s2">those terms, it’s a very, very straightforward<br />story, right.</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.910" end="00:23:06.521" style="s2">It’s basically the story of human beings,<br />fundamentally the story of human beings, because</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.521" end="00:23:12.760" style="s2">we, in the words of a famous evolutionary<br />psychologist, whose name completely escapes</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.760" end="00:23:15.620" style="s2">me, we occupy the cognitive niche, right.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.620" end="00:23:23.830" style="s2">Our mode of being is creativity in the face<br />of the unknown and when Chaos threatens the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.830" end="00:23:28.600" style="s2">established mode of being, it’s necessary<br />for us to put our creativity into action and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.600" end="00:23:34.190" style="s2">to carve out new territory as a consequence<br />of encounter with the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.190" end="00:23:35.190" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.190" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">Well because we can take the world apart with<br />our hands and put it together in new ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">and then we can code what we’ve done verbally<br />and we can transmit it to another person and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:45.730" style="s2">then they can do the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.730" end="00:23:48.850" style="s2">And we’re all doing this all the time and<br />we’re all telling each other how we’re</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.850" end="00:23:49.850" style="s2">doing it.</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.850" end="00:23:54.040" style="s2">And that’s how the embodiment of logos in<br />the human being, which is precisely equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.040" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">to the Sumerian notion of Marduk, that’s<br />precisely how it is that we’re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.380" style="s2">capable of redeeming the world.</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.380" end="00:24:10.010" style="s2">and that’s why you make resolutions at New<br />Year’s because the new you is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.010" end="00:24:11.640" style="s2">be born at the new year.</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.640" end="00:24:15.100" style="s2">OK, so what do the<br />Mesopotamians do at the new year?</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.100" end="00:24:18.680" style="s2">They take their king and they bring him outside<br />the city.</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.680" end="00:24:24.260" style="s2">Now you have to understand that outside the<br />city is chaos, right, because these are city</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.260" end="00:24:25.700" style="s2">states.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.700" end="00:24:31.630" style="s2">When you go outside the dominion of the human,<br />you’re in chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.630" end="00:24:37.720" style="s2">And then the priest makes the emperor kneel<br />and takes all his marks of status off him</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.720" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">so he’s reduced to his essence fundamentally,<br />bereft of his social persona, and then he</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:50.670" style="s2">slaps him with a glove and humiliateshim and<br />the king is forced to recount his sins, right,</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.670" end="00:24:53.680" style="s2">everything he did in the<br />last year that wasn’t up to Marduk standards,</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.680" end="00:24:54.680" style="s2">so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.680" end="00:24:58.040" style="s2">And you can see, that’d be a pretty useful<br />thing to have somebody who’s in power do</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.040" end="00:25:03.970" style="s2">on a regular basis, right, because it reminds<br />them that they’re in fact subject to a trans-personal</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.970" end="00:25:09.890" style="s2">structure whose nature isn’t precisely evident<br />but is nonetheless there, which is the case.</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.890" end="00:25:14.700" style="s2">Act like Marduk or all hell will break loose<br />and demolish your kingdom, which of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.700" end="00:25:17.260" style="s2">is true now,<br />as it was then now.</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.260" end="00:25:24.660" style="s2">So the emperor gets humiliated, he has to<br />recount his sins, then he’s locked up, then</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.660" end="00:25:29.940" style="s2">he<br />Re-enacts the battle with Tiamat and when</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.940" end="00:25:36.601" style="s2">he emerges victorious, he’s locked up with<br />a ritual prostitute, a hierodule, and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.601" end="00:25:37.601" style="s2">mate.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.601" end="00:25:38.601" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.601" end="00:25:43.070" style="s2">Well, the<br />Hierodule, the ritual prostitute, represents</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.070" end="00:25:44.070" style="s2">Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.070" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">Now why the hell<br />would that be, because Tiamat’s a dragon,</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">right, a horrible man-eating dragon that lives<br />at the bottom of the ocean which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:57.020" style="s2">that in any encounter with the<br />unknown, as difficult traumatic and violent</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.020" end="00:26:02.610" style="s2">as that might be, there’s also the possibility<br />for something creative to emerge as a consequence,</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.610" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">right, because it’s out of the<br />unknown that we mine new information</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:15.180" style="s2">So insofar as the Mesopotamian emperor acted<br />out the role of Marduk, then he was a good</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.180" end="00:26:20.540" style="s2">emperor, then he deserved his sovereignty<br />and literally as well as figuratively, insofar</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.540" end="00:26:24.670" style="s2">as he did play that role, then the society<br />was going to remain not only stable but constantly</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.670" end="00:26:31.610" style="s2">updated because he’s engaged in this constant<br />creative contact with the unknown, aided and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.610" end="00:26:37.340" style="s2">abetted by his attempts to remember his own<br />inadequacies and weaknesses and to do something</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.340" end="00:26:38.340" style="s2">about them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.340" end="00:26:41.910" style="s2">OK, so that’s a pretty interesting story<br />and it gets even more interesting when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.910" end="00:26:48.200" style="s2">start to understand that the Judao-Christian<br />myth is assimilated to the Sumerian creation</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.200" end="00:26:52.630" style="s2">myth by the union of the notions of chaos<br />and Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.630" end="00:26:57.170" style="s2">So the logos in Judao-Christian thinking,<br />the word of God that produces order out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.170" end="00:27:03.270" style="s2">chaos, is also essentially equivalent – at<br />least metaphorically speaking – to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.270" end="00:27:06.470" style="s2">Marduk represents in the Sumerian creation<br />myth.</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.470" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">And we know that I mean our relationship with<br />the Enuma Elish is obscured by time but our</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:15.730" style="s2">relationship with the stories that lay out<br />the fundamental sub-structure of western culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.730" end="00:27:19.850" style="s2">is not so ameliorated even though we may not<br />believe them explicitly anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.850" end="00:27:22.070" style="s2">They still sit at the basis of our society.</p>
