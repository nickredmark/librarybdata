<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">talk about some of the topics that we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">or so and then immediately launch into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:57.240" style="s2">second live stream of again about 45</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:05:59.340" style="s2">minutes or an hour in which we answer</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.990" end="00:06:05.210" style="s2">right to edit</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.930" end="00:06:08.630" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for nothing pre-modern</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.630" end="00:06:14.420" style="s2">that actually are interested seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:16.970" style="s2">interested in in furthering knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.420" end="00:06:20.120" style="s2">and compassion that we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.970" end="00:06:21.050" style="s2">bring to this topic and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.120" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">there&#39;s anything else to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.050" end="00:06:25.850" style="s2">right now to be clear you can lodge your</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:27.860" style="s2">super chat questions during this stream</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.850" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">we will look over them in the break and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.860" end="00:06:32.030" style="s2">then we will return to those questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">in the next one at the point that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.030" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">move to break you will have a link that</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">you can click that takes you to the next</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:38.390" style="s2">stream the link will be in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.340" style="s2">description I don&#39;t think the one that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.390" end="00:06:42.020" style="s2">you will see on screen is clickable but</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.340" end="00:06:43.490" style="s2">if you scroll down you&#39;ll find it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.020" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">just I guess one more thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.490" end="00:06:47.660" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try to do this on Tuesdays</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:49.610" style="s2">and Fridays for a while at least while</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.660" end="00:06:51.290" style="s2">we&#39;re all in some kind of lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:53.270" style="s2">together we&#39;ve had to move it a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.290" end="00:06:55.220" style="s2">bit later because as of today zach is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.270" end="00:06:57.950" style="s2">back in virtual school which means he</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.220" end="00:06:59.780" style="s2">has obligations up until about 20</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.950" end="00:07:01.910" style="s2">minutes before we&#39;re starting here so</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.780" end="00:07:03.710" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna in general try to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">this at 3:30 Pacific time we know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.710" end="00:07:08.540" style="s2">a little bit late for a lot of people we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:11.570" style="s2">apologize on Tuesdays and Fridays yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.540" end="00:07:16.210" style="s2">unfortunately for people in Europe this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.570" end="00:07:18.920" style="s2">is quite late the streams will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.210" end="00:07:22.090" style="s2">republished as Dark Horse podcast so</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.920" end="00:07:25.180" style="s2">that you can use them on a podcast app</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.090" end="00:07:28.310" style="s2">alright so shall we start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.180" end="00:07:31.880" style="s2">connection erections yes one major</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.310" end="00:07:34.490" style="s2">correction for me I said in our last</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.880" end="00:07:37.730" style="s2">stream that coronaviruses were</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.490" end="00:07:40.700" style="s2">retroviruses that is incorrect corona</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.730" end="00:07:42.890" style="s2">viruses are RNA viruses but there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.700" end="00:07:45.320" style="s2">three kinds of RNA viruses and corona</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.890" end="00:07:48.110" style="s2">viruses are not retroviruses which means</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:51.080" style="s2">that they do not reverse transcribe from</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.110" end="00:07:52.700" style="s2">RNA to DNA and they do not insert</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.080" end="00:07:58.280" style="s2">themselves into the genome of the cells</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.700" end="00:08:00.170" style="s2">as I said so that is in one sense a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.280" end="00:08:02.930" style="s2">technical correction and in another</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.170" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">sense it&#39;s very important because it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.930" end="00:08:07.820" style="s2">implications and in fact it changes my</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:12.350" style="s2">assessment of the likelihood that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.820" end="00:08:14.840" style="s2">will see a viable vaccine these corona</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.350" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">viruses are better targets for a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.840" end="00:08:18.790" style="s2">than retro</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">viruses are by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.790" end="00:08:24.520" style="s2">they are more slowly adapting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">therefore the targets of a vaccine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.520" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">is to say the antigens that the virus</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:34.150" style="s2">produces are a a much more slowly moving</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:38.020" style="s2">target so I would say my estimation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.150" end="00:08:38.860" style="s2">the chances of us having a vaccine in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.020" end="00:08:41.469" style="s2">short order</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:43.270" style="s2">I have improved substantially as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.469" end="00:08:45.340" style="s2">result of the fact that this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.270" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">retrovirus that we&#39;re dealing with still</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.340" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">think the medical situation is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:52.300" style="s2">serious I did want to say though I saw</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:54.820" style="s2">at least a couple of comments where</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.300" end="00:08:57.610" style="s2">people had suggested that I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.820" end="00:09:00.280" style="s2">portraying the viral situation as</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.610" end="00:09:02.170" style="s2">extremely dire and that effectively I</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.280" end="00:09:04.300" style="s2">was leading the viral situation of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.170" end="00:09:07.000" style="s2">vaccine situations of viral situation as</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.300" end="00:09:09.100" style="s2">extremely dire and suggesting that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.000" end="00:09:12.010" style="s2">we were all doomed which is not at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.100" end="00:09:13.990" style="s2">my perspective even if we were to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.010" end="00:09:16.360" style="s2">nothing about this virus the huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.990" end="00:09:19.480" style="s2">fraction of people who seem to get the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.360" end="00:09:21.250" style="s2">disease and be asymptomatic suggests</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.480" end="00:09:23.770" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way for selection to fix</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.250" end="00:09:26.200" style="s2">this problem without our intervention</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.770" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">the problem with that solution is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.200" end="00:09:31.630" style="s2">it involves a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:33.880" style="s2">needless suffering and death and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.630" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">tremendous amount of tragedy for</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.880" end="00:09:38.050" style="s2">individuals who would lose people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:42.490" style="s2">they care deeply about so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.050" end="00:09:44.950" style="s2">avoid that outcome for deeply human</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.490" end="00:09:46.930" style="s2">reasons but we do not have to avoid that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.950" end="00:09:50.020" style="s2">outcome in order for Humanity to survive</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.930" end="00:09:51.670" style="s2">this as the virus currently functions it</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.020" end="00:09:55.570" style="s2">creates a lot of devastation but it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.670" end="00:09:58.450" style="s2">leaves a lot of people uninjured and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.570" end="00:10:00.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s quite positive I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.450" end="00:10:05.230" style="s2">however quite frightened of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.820" end="00:10:07.240" style="s2">consequences of this crisis for society</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.230" end="00:10:08.589" style="s2">and so we will get back to the societal</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.240" end="00:10:12.430" style="s2">implications later but to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.589" end="00:10:14.770" style="s2">that people read me as very concerned I</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.430" end="00:10:16.900" style="s2">am concerned about the virus I&#39;d like us</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.770" end="00:10:18.970" style="s2">to avoid as much tragedy as possible but</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.900" end="00:10:21.130" style="s2">I&#39;m much more concerned about what this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.970" end="00:10:26.260" style="s2">reveals about the fragility of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.130" end="00:10:30.100" style="s2">system all right let&#39;s see Oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.260" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">other Corrections more minor I had one</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.100" end="00:10:34.089" style="s2">during the last podcast whether people</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:36.310" style="s2">actually eat Pangolin turns out they do</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.089" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">eat Pangolin but it is also the case</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.310" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">that Pangolin is being used as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">medicinal at the scale scales understood</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:47.079" style="s2">to have medicinal properties especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:49.839" style="s2">in Chinese medicine and so Pangolin</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.079" end="00:10:55.750" style="s2">shows up in these wet markets for both</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.839" end="00:10:57.070" style="s2">of those reasons and let&#39;s see the final</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.750" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">correction you were gonna talk about was</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">dogs all right so I had said that very</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:09.310" style="s2">little by way of viruses is transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">to dogs and by dogs to people and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.310" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">remains true although I did see a report</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">where two dogs had been diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:21.700" style="s2">kovat 19 now there&#39;s also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">debate about the quality of the testing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.700" end="00:11:28.540" style="s2">and in the case of one of these dogs the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:31.690" style="s2">animal was categorized as having died of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.540" end="00:11:34.779" style="s2">kovat 19 but the animal was something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.690" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">like 17 years old which is a really long</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.779" end="00:11:40.390" style="s2">run for a dog so in any case it is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">highly transmissible to dogs and there</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.390" end="00:11:44.339" style="s2">are no known cases in which a human is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:47.260" style="s2">picked it up from a dog as far as I know</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.339" end="00:11:50.380" style="s2">but it is it doesn&#39;t and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.260" end="00:11:52.089" style="s2">put the lie to the idea that humans in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.380" end="00:11:53.820" style="s2">prehistory may have been selecting</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.089" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">against dogs that did transmit diseases</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.820" end="00:11:59.589" style="s2">because again this this virus human</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:02.230" style="s2">interaction is brand-new we have no</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.589" end="00:12:04.390" style="s2">history with this so even to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.230" end="00:12:07.630" style="s2">that prehistorical humans were really</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.390" end="00:12:08.770" style="s2">good at getting rid of dogs who showed</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.630" end="00:12:10.810" style="s2">sign of diseases that could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.770" end="00:12:14.649" style="s2">transmitted to humans the fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.810" end="00:12:17.980" style="s2">relationship between SARS co2 and humans</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.649" end="00:12:20.260" style="s2">is brand-new suggests no history yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.980" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">history so there are two questions one</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.260" end="00:12:25.980" style="s2">are we are our dogs unlikely to carry</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:28.990" style="s2">things that we would catch because our</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.980" end="00:12:30.459" style="s2">prehistoric ancestors did a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.990" end="00:12:32.380" style="s2">eliminating dogs that carried things</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.459" end="00:12:33.880" style="s2">that we caught and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.380" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">question about whether they may have</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.880" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">selected for something in dogs that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:41.900" style="s2">special immunity to things in which case</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:45.410" style="s2">it might have some implication for</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.900" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">for kovat 19 but we don&#39;t know this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.410" end="00:12:48.050" style="s2">all evolutionary speculation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.770" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.050" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">watch us with our arms so with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.770" end="00:12:57.170" style="s2">me excuse me Corrections that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">make I this this could be the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.170" end="00:13:00.770" style="s2">a conversation that lasts hours and of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:04.820" style="s2">itself but getting back to this question</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.770" end="00:13:11.540" style="s2">of bush meat and exotic meat and what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.820" end="00:13:13.310" style="s2">is who tends to eat these things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.540" end="00:13:15.620" style="s2">what the risks are to the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.310" end="00:13:19.810" style="s2">world when people do eat these things I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.620" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">I initially categorized the types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.810" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">situations in which these things are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:28.580" style="s2">eaten into - and although Brett tried to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:30.170" style="s2">add the third category which is far more</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.580" end="00:13:31.400" style="s2">important in the current conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.170" end="00:13:33.110" style="s2">wasn&#39;t one that I paid any attention to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.400" end="00:13:36.529" style="s2">you so let me just walk it back a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:39.830" style="s2">bit and say I understand bush meat to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.529" end="00:13:41.900" style="s2">meat what meat of wild animals that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.830" end="00:13:43.670" style="s2">hunted in the place where both the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.900" end="00:13:46.700" style="s2">animals and the people hunting them are</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.670" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">from and I think of exotic men in</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.700" end="00:13:52.760" style="s2">generally bush meat is a term reserved</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:54.050" style="s2">for tropical places for the developing</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.760" end="00:13:57.650" style="s2">world rather than the developed world</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.050" end="00:13:59.570" style="s2">but you know you just like peccaries</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.650" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">being hunted by the Huaorani and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.570" end="00:14:06.770" style="s2">amazon has thousands of years of history</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:08.690" style="s2">and so those peccaries are unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.770" end="00:14:12.620" style="s2">cause much harm to the wool Ronnie who</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.690" end="00:14:14.779" style="s2">eat them North Americans hunting deer as</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.620" end="00:14:16.490" style="s2">most North Americans now hunting deer</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.779" end="00:14:18.290" style="s2">don&#39;t have thousands of years of hunting</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.490" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">deer but certainly there is a thousands</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.290" end="00:14:24.410" style="s2">of years history of Americans hunting</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:27.290" style="s2">deer in north and even South America and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.410" end="00:14:30.260" style="s2">so that is also unlikely to cause any</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.290" end="00:14:33.020" style="s2">long-term long-term harm to anything but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.260" end="00:14:35.150" style="s2">the deer meat and obviously so I I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.020" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">of all of that as bush meat and there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.150" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">you know a long evolutionary history of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:45.830" style="s2">hunting meat that is wild and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:47.779" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think that anyone really</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.830" end="00:14:49.850" style="s2">is making the argument that people</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.779" end="00:14:52.670" style="s2">should not be allowed to hunt wild</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.850" end="00:14:54.400" style="s2">animals anywhere ever again okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.670" end="00:14:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s one category and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.400" end="00:14:58.900" style="s2">is fairly common generally honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.280" end="00:15:01.420" style="s2">fine right</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.900" end="00:15:04.450" style="s2">the second category which I mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.420" end="00:15:06.930" style="s2">our last livestream is the is what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.450" end="00:15:09.940" style="s2">think of as exotic meat where people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.930" end="00:15:11.560" style="s2">creating demand in the system for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.940" end="00:15:13.210" style="s2">meat the flesh of wild animals from</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.560" end="00:15:16.500" style="s2">places that they aren&#39;t and may never</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.210" end="00:15:19.410" style="s2">even have been and so the you know rich</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.500" end="00:15:22.630" style="s2">rich Londoners in fancy restaurants</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.410" end="00:15:25.630" style="s2">ordering up whatever it is from for</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.630" end="00:15:27.790" style="s2">instance Africa is an example of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.630" end="00:15:29.350" style="s2">and there&#39;s just no justification for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.790" end="00:15:32.410" style="s2">this whatsoever but it is a tiny tiny</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.350" end="00:15:34.570" style="s2">piece of the global market for exotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.410" end="00:15:37.150" style="s2">and bush made there&#39;s no excuse for it</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.570" end="00:15:39.760" style="s2">and we shouldn&#39;t tolerate it but the far</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.150" end="00:15:45.220" style="s2">larger issue is in the far larger market</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.760" end="00:15:47.620" style="s2">is for what you know either either meat</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.220" end="00:15:49.330" style="s2">of wild animals or the parts of wild</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.620" end="00:15:53.140" style="s2">animals like Pangolin scales for</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.330" end="00:15:58.050" style="s2">instance or Tiger penis right in places</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.140" end="00:16:01.900" style="s2">where those animals are local and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:05.860" style="s2">encouraged through because of culinary</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.900" end="00:16:08.890" style="s2">cultural reasons and humans don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.860" end="00:16:10.900" style="s2">as long a history as extensive a history</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.890" end="00:16:13.540" style="s2">eating or using these things and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.900" end="00:16:16.420" style="s2">are much more likely to bring out</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.540" end="00:16:19.450" style="s2">zoonotic diseases like the virus we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.420" end="00:16:21.610" style="s2">now dealing with I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.450" end="00:16:24.070" style="s2">want to add anything more things I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.610" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">say again the gold standard for errors</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.070" end="00:16:29.170" style="s2">in this regard is the eating of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:31.810" style="s2">chimpanzee which as far as we know was</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.170" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">people who live nearby too rich in</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.810" end="00:16:38.590" style="s2">pansies are native but chimpanzee is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:40.570" style="s2">on anybody&#39;s ancestral menu it was being</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.590" end="00:16:43.390" style="s2">hunted because it could be hunted and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.570" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">because it could be sold and the price</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.390" end="00:16:49.210" style="s2">that humanity paid for HIV jumping the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:52.510" style="s2">gap from chimpanzees into humans was</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.210" end="00:16:54.820" style="s2">absolutely immense so we have to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.510" end="00:16:57.850" style="s2">that irrespective of what category it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.820" end="00:17:00.370" style="s2">falls into it&#39;s just too dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.850" end="00:17:02.200" style="s2">to contemplate you know and it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.370" end="00:17:04.780" style="s2">only reason obviously as you said before</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.200" end="00:17:07.050" style="s2">not to eat chimpanzee but it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.780" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">sufficient unto itself for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.050" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">stamp out all that kind of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:13.320" style="s2">which does mean that the people who find</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:16.190" style="s2">themselves hunting these animals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.320" end="00:17:18.660" style="s2">selling them have to have viable</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.190" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">economic alternatives that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.660" end="00:17:25.020" style="s2">so Zach dude can you pull up the yang at</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:26.280" style="s2">all 2020 paper if if it&#39;s easy great if</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.020" end="00:17:29.790" style="s2">not it&#39;s not a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.280" end="00:17:33.740" style="s2">yep yang at all its near the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.790" end="00:17:37.590" style="s2">second page of notes that I gave you so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.740" end="00:17:40.020" style="s2">the in that third category of meats that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.590" end="00:17:41.550" style="s2">he could eaten and are often often end</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.210" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">because as is almost always the case</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:14.580" style="s2">weaponized so what a wet market actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.400" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">means is that perishable goods are sold</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.580" end="00:18:19.560" style="s2">so a produce market a market devoted</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:21.750" style="s2">entirely to selling mangoes is a wet</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.560" end="00:18:24.090" style="s2">market a market entirely devoted to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.750" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">selling dead chickens could you put that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.090" end="00:18:32.040" style="s2">back up okay thank you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:35.130" style="s2">and so as this paper is suggesting live</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.040" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">poultry trade in some wet markets is</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.130" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">quite different from markets that sell</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:46.430" style="s2">only dead dead chickens so in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:48.420" style="s2">we generally have entirely markets of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.430" end="00:18:51.690" style="s2">animals that have already been killed</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.420" end="00:18:53.670" style="s2">and generally butchered as well and what</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:55.980" style="s2">market does not make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.670" end="00:18:58.350" style="s2">between whether or not it&#39;s meat is</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.980" end="00:18:59.700" style="s2">being sold versus produce or whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.350" end="00:19:04.280" style="s2">that meat is live or not</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.700" end="00:19:07.230" style="s2">but what this article finds is that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.280" end="00:19:11.990" style="s2">in several excuse me in several regions</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.230" end="00:19:15.240" style="s2">in China when they compared the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.990" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">transmission of virus between areas</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.240" end="00:19:20.669" style="s2">where markets were selling live chickens</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">versus I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.669" end="00:19:25.919" style="s2">between areas where live chickens were</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:27.350" style="s2">sold but between in in those areas live</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.919" end="00:19:32.340" style="s2">chickens themselves were not being</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.350" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">transferred the viral load in humans was</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.340" end="00:19:37.019" style="s2">much higher it&#39;s been unfortunate couple</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:38.639" style="s2">days since I looked at this paper so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.019" end="00:19:40.739" style="s2">think I&#39;ve got that right but the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.639" end="00:19:41.909" style="s2">long and the short of it the take-home</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.739" end="00:19:48.269" style="s2">message you could take it down if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.909" end="00:19:50.879" style="s2">want sack is that virus virus is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.269" end="00:19:52.529" style="s2">transported far faster in markets and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.879" end="00:19:53.909" style="s2">between markets where live animals are</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.529" end="00:19:55.950" style="s2">being sold than we&#39;re dead markets are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.909" end="00:19:58.889" style="s2">being sold so this raises the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.950" end="00:20:01.080" style="s2">of is it really wet markets all</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.889" end="00:20:03.419" style="s2">inclusive you know since you since you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.080" end="00:20:04.440" style="s2">lotto that we are trying that we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.419" end="00:20:06.239" style="s2">talking about what we&#39;re complaining</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.440" end="00:20:07.350" style="s2">about wet markets or should we be</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.239" end="00:20:11.220" style="s2">actually making the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.350" end="00:20:13.289" style="s2">distinction between is it is the meat</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.220" end="00:20:15.119" style="s2">being sold alive or is it dead and if</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.289" end="00:20:19.049" style="s2">it&#39;s dead it has a far lower chance of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.119" end="00:20:21.090" style="s2">of transmitting virus and also is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.049" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">meat wild or domesticated and again</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.090" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">there&#39;s plet there are plenty of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:27.960" style="s2">in the world who hunt wild animals and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:29.399" style="s2">do so honorably and without great risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.960" end="00:20:30.840" style="s2">and special especially if they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.399" end="00:20:32.070" style="s2">then selling that meat if they&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.840" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">they&#39;re keeping that risk within</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.070" end="00:20:38.009" style="s2">themselves but what market the term wet</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:40.710" style="s2">market does not distinguish between live</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.009" end="00:20:42.749" style="s2">versus dead meat being sold or wild</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.710" end="00:20:44.999" style="s2">versus domesticated animals being sold</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.749" end="00:20:46.739" style="s2">both of which are going to be important</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.999" end="00:20:48.690" style="s2">factors in determining the risk of those</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.739" end="00:20:51.659" style="s2">wet markets so we should probably point</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.690" end="00:20:55.590" style="s2">out that there is a reason that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.659" end="00:20:57.929" style="s2">would prefer to keep live animals in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.590" end="00:20:59.940" style="s2">wet market which is that once the animal</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.929" end="00:21:03.799" style="s2">is dead a clock starts with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.940" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">how long that meat is viable and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.799" end="00:21:08.549" style="s2">anyway keeping animals alive as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:11.970" style="s2">preserve the meat and so what we have is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.549" end="00:21:14.549" style="s2">a trade-off and again I would say if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.970" end="00:21:16.859" style="s2">are to make requirements about what can</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.549" end="00:21:20.700" style="s2">and can&#39;t be sold we have to give people</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.859" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">a viable means to do what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.700" end="00:21:23.730" style="s2">if they&#39;re in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.649" style="s2">refrigerating meat would be impractical</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.730" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">or freezing it would be impractical than</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.649" end="00:21:29.129" style="s2">keeping the animals live as you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the supply chain for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.129" end="00:21:33.620" style="s2">meat and so anyway we have to provide</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">viable alternatives to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.620" end="00:21:39.170" style="s2">one of these mechanisms is putting</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">humanity at dame in danger which which</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.170" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">it is yeah this this reminds me actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:45.590" style="s2">of one of the last times we were at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:47.420" style="s2">animal market in cuenca and the andes in</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.590" end="00:21:47.900" style="s2">ecuador and they were selling guinea</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.420" end="00:21:50.690" style="s2">pigs</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:52.490" style="s2">and I asked the guy is this what are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.690" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">selling this for is that food or pet he</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.490" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">said how&#39;d you like whatever you want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">do with it come you know let&#39;s go at</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:22:01.670" style="s2">that either way yep so anyway that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:03.290" style="s2">shall so before we leave that topic we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.670" end="00:22:05.660" style="s2">should probably just say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.290" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">precautionary principle is a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.660" end="00:22:11.990" style="s2">contentious matter clearly what we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:13.670" style="s2">here is a circumstance where some</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.990" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">version of the precautionary principle</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.670" end="00:22:17.780" style="s2">has to rule there are behaviors that go</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:19.429" style="s2">back thousands of years and we have no</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.780" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">reason to think that they are dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.429" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">and then we have other behaviors which</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:27.110" style="s2">have just been invented or have only</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:31.460" style="s2">recently become possible like hunting</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.110" end="00:22:35.150" style="s2">chimpanzee or hunting chimpanzee for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.460" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">sale at a market and we should treat</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.150" end="00:22:41.210" style="s2">those with much greater care i know</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.550" style="s2">historically that you&#39;ve really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.210" end="00:22:45.860" style="s2">talking about bats so let&#39;s do it bats</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.550" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">bats bats yeah yep so I wanted to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.860" end="00:22:50.390" style="s2">little bit about why bats are showing up</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:52.160" style="s2">in this story and why they showed up in</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.390" end="00:22:54.260" style="s2">the Czar&#39;s story and there are really</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.160" end="00:22:57.080" style="s2">two components here I&#39;ve seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.260" end="00:22:59.809" style="s2">ink spilled over this question</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.080" end="00:23:02.660" style="s2">none of it I thought to good effect yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.809" end="00:23:05.480" style="s2">and so there are two two components if</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.660" end="00:23:07.300" style="s2">you&#39;re asking yourself why why is it the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.480" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">bats are transmitting disease to humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.300" end="00:23:10.970" style="s2">there&#39;s one fairly straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:12.260" style="s2">answer and then there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">that&#39;s more interesting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.260" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">straightforward one is that bats</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">probably comprise a much larger fraction</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:23.660" style="s2">of the biota and in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:25.940" style="s2">mammalian biota then you would think so</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.660" end="00:23:29.480" style="s2">it turns out there are something like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.940" end="00:23:31.010" style="s2">thousand species it&#39;s actually so we</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.480" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">actually have more than 6,000 species of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.010" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">mammals now with the fractions holding</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:37.570" style="s2">steady but the fraction is holding</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:40.160" style="s2">roughly steady yeah it&#39;s not that so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.570" end="00:23:42.200" style="s2">when I was in graduate school I studied</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.160" end="00:23:43.970" style="s2">bats and bats were a quarter of all</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.200" end="00:23:45.590" style="s2">mammals that were thought to be four</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.970" end="00:23:47.090" style="s2">thousand species of mammals the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.590" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">that they&#39;re now thought to be something</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.090" end="00:23:51.020" style="s2">like 6,000 is not a result of a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.700" style="s2">mammals having been discovered it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.020" end="00:23:55.400" style="s2">result of a lot more fine gradations</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.700" end="00:23:58.150" style="s2">having been named whether that&#39;s durable</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.400" end="00:24:02.539" style="s2">or not but nonetheless bats comprised</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.150" end="00:24:06.620" style="s2">something close to a 5th to a quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.539" end="00:24:08.750" style="s2">all mammal species and so when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.620" end="00:24:10.549" style="s2">about bats we often think about you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.750" end="00:24:12.980" style="s2">things that we sort of vaguely see</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.549" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">flying around and we think that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.980" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">are only a few species in which case it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:18.440" style="s2">would be truly remarkable how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">viruses were being passed by them but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.440" end="00:24:22.190" style="s2">when you know that there are a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:24.340" style="s2">species of them out there doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.190" end="00:24:29.450" style="s2">these different things it is less</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.340" end="00:24:33.020" style="s2">surprising I think just to back up a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.450" end="00:24:35.960" style="s2">little bit why would we expect mammals</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.020" end="00:24:37.760" style="s2">to be the source of these own otic</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.960" end="00:24:40.760" style="s2">diseases because we are mammals and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:42.890" style="s2">therefore we expect the transfers to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.760" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">easiest between more closely related</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.890" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">species so it&#39;s it&#39;s been proposed for</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:52.520" style="s2">instance that that Tsarskoe of two came</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:54.470" style="s2">from a bat yes but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.520" end="00:24:56.270" style="s2">intermediate host was a snake in fact an</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.470" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">elite bit like a relative of a cobra or</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.270" end="00:25:00.440" style="s2">a sea Krait and it&#39;s probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:05.240" style="s2">case as it turns out but that would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.440" end="00:25:07.010" style="s2">more surprising a bit then if for</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.240" end="00:25:08.690" style="s2">instance it had an intermediate host my</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.010" end="00:25:11.059" style="s2">Pangolin because snakes are so much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.690" end="00:25:14.570" style="s2">distantly related to us than our mammals</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.059" end="00:25:17.020" style="s2">so why you know why mammals why are so</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.570" end="00:25:19.850" style="s2">many species of rodents implicated in</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.020" end="00:25:22.250" style="s2">transfer in transferring diseases well</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.850" end="00:25:24.710" style="s2">half of all mammals are rodents 1/4 ish</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.250" end="00:25:26.750" style="s2">of all mammals are bats so we&#39;ve got you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.710" end="00:25:27.980" style="s2">know why mammals because we&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.750" end="00:25:30.289" style="s2">closely related to mammals because we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">are mammals and then why are rodents and</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.289" end="00:25:33.490" style="s2">bats always the ones who are being</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:37.250" style="s2">implicated well together they make up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.490" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">three-quarters of all mammals so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.250" end="00:25:42.700" style="s2">question about phylogenetic proximity is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:45.830" style="s2">clearly important the mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.700" end="00:25:47.570" style="s2">viruses that transmit within a species</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.830" end="00:25:49.100" style="s2">to jump to and other species are more</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.570" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">likely to be present if that species is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.100" end="00:25:54.020" style="s2">closely related but they&#39;re obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">large number of cases of things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:25:58.999" style="s2">bird flu right that&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:02.299" style="s2">phylogenetic gap</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.999" end="00:26:04.489" style="s2">yet we see viruses having jumped it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.299" end="00:26:07.220" style="s2">that leads me to the second point about</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.489" end="00:26:08.809" style="s2">bats which I don&#39;t see forgive me if</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.220" end="00:26:10.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve missed somebody&#39;s description of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.809" end="00:26:14.119" style="s2">somewhere but there&#39;s a very obvious</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.700" end="00:26:18.279" style="s2">reason for viruses to be coming from</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.119" end="00:26:21.169" style="s2">bats and that has to do with the virus&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.279" end="00:26:22.639" style="s2">preference I use that term in quotes</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.169" end="00:26:24.649" style="s2">because obviously viruses don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.639" end="00:26:26.899" style="s2">real preferences but to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.649" end="00:26:28.940" style="s2">the virus&#39;s purpose is to get itself as</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.899" end="00:26:31.749" style="s2">deeply into the future as possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.940" end="00:26:34.489" style="s2">bats are an especially good host why</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.749" end="00:26:36.200" style="s2">because they fly same reason that birds</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.489" end="00:26:39.830" style="s2">are an especially good host because they</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.200" end="00:26:41.960" style="s2">fly and so few they present fewer</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.830" end="00:26:45.259" style="s2">barriers to dispersal as a host and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.960" end="00:26:47.149" style="s2">therefore they open up more landscape</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.259" end="00:26:49.369" style="s2">metaphorical landscape and literal</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.149" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">landscape for the virus within them yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.369" end="00:26:54.349" style="s2">they in fact they provide a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:55.999" style="s2">a dispersal problem and it won&#39;t be all</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.349" end="00:27:02.019" style="s2">bats either you really have two</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.999" end="00:27:04.340" style="s2">different kinds of dispersal problems so</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.019" end="00:27:07.029" style="s2">actually is that could you put up the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.340" end="00:27:10.489" style="s2">picture first of me on the forest floor</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.029" end="00:27:13.629" style="s2">you have that one yeah okay so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.489" end="00:27:15.590" style="s2">picture of me a couple months ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.629" end="00:27:18.739" style="s2">actually before we had ever heard of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.590" end="00:27:21.649" style="s2">kovat 19 on the floor of the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.739" end="00:27:23.749" style="s2">taking a picture of one of the species</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.649" end="00:27:26.149" style="s2">that I studied when I was in graduate</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.749" end="00:27:28.070" style="s2">school Heather and I were in the Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.149" end="00:27:29.570" style="s2">and I managed to find a few of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.070" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">guys can you now put up the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.570" end="00:27:36.139" style="s2">the bats now there we go so here we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.789" style="s2">some tent making bats these are this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.139" end="00:27:39.229" style="s2">this is the picture that Brett was</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.789" end="00:27:40.999" style="s2">taking when I was taking the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.229" end="00:27:43.580" style="s2">Brett yep there you go so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.999" end="00:27:47.599" style="s2">little bit meta but anyway these bats</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.580" end="00:27:50.299" style="s2">are new world frugivores and they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.599" end="00:27:52.580" style="s2">roosting in what&#39;s called a tent which</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.299" end="00:27:54.590" style="s2">is a leaf that they have modified into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.580" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">structure that protects them from being</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.590" end="00:28:01.340" style="s2">seen and protects them from rain so</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:04.429" style="s2">these guys have the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.340" end="00:28:06.169" style="s2">disperse a virus from one place to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.429" end="00:28:08.149" style="s2">another in other words a river wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.169" end="00:28:09.529" style="s2">be any obstacle to these animals moving</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.149" end="00:28:11.450" style="s2">from one part of the forest to the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.529" end="00:28:12.990" style="s2">but they aren&#39;t very good as hosts</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.450" end="00:28:14.700" style="s2">because you see a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.990" end="00:28:16.230" style="s2">number of them roosting together here</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.700" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">whereas there are many species of bats</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.230" end="00:28:19.919" style="s2">that roost by the thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:22.500" style="s2">sometimes the hundreds of thousands in</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:25.529" style="s2">these very large caves so such an animal</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.500" end="00:28:27.690" style="s2">would be an ideal host because to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.529" end="00:28:29.669" style="s2">extent that it became infected the virus</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.690" end="00:28:31.350" style="s2">could spread within this very large</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.669" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">colony and then all of the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.350" end="00:28:35.399" style="s2">in that colony would be capable of</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:37.350" style="s2">spreading it across the landscape such</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.399" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">an animal meaning not these guys right</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.350" end="00:28:41.340" style="s2">so it isn&#39;t going to be all bats but</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:44.130" style="s2">there are going to be certain baths</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.340" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">certain ecological parameters which make</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.130" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">bats a particularly good host from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:49.260" style="s2">point of view of doing the viruses</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:51.210" style="s2">bidding which is what the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.260" end="00:28:53.309" style="s2">interested in right the virus wants to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.210" end="00:28:55.890" style="s2">get into the future and one way to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.309" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">into the future is to hitch a ride with</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.890" end="00:29:01.850" style="s2">a creature that can cross boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:05.429" style="s2">like for example you know in Indonesia</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.850" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">any animal that is restricted by water</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.429" end="00:29:09.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to be able to get from one</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.110" end="00:29:12.090" style="s2">island to the next a bat is going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.510" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">often be undaunted by the water and many</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.090" end="00:29:15.539" style="s2">of species will regularly transit</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:17.190" style="s2">between islands so it makes a good host</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.539" end="00:29:19.649" style="s2">from the point of view of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.190" end="00:29:20.580" style="s2">leaping from one place to another so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.649" end="00:29:23.610" style="s2">always have to think in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.580" end="00:29:24.929" style="s2">evolutionary form and one way to say it</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.610" end="00:29:27.419" style="s2">is to the extent that the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.929" end="00:29:30.149" style="s2">trying to get into the future it hooks</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.419" end="00:29:31.590" style="s2">its wagon to the star of some creature</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.149" end="00:29:34.020" style="s2">that is capable of crossing these</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.590" end="00:29:35.610" style="s2">boundaries therefore which viruses is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.020" end="00:29:37.289" style="s2">it that we see in the present they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.610" end="00:29:39.720" style="s2">the ones that have done so well in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.289" end="00:29:41.399" style="s2">past what were the characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.720" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">allowed them to do well in the past well</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.399" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">the fact that they are transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:48.539" style="s2">between bats and other bats and from</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:51.570" style="s2">bats to intermediate hosts like maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.539" end="00:29:53.970" style="s2">Pangolin then they would be potentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.570" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">successful so we shouldn&#39;t be too</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.970" end="00:29:57.720" style="s2">surprised and in fact this is a general</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:30:00.980" style="s2">property that isn&#39;t even really about</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.720" end="00:30:04.860" style="s2">viruses if you think about the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.980" end="00:30:09.270" style="s2">flavor of the spicy flavor of capsaicin</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.860" end="00:30:12.809" style="s2">the sensation of hotness in food Chili</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.539" end="00:30:23.010" style="s2">that it was loaded in to dissuade</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.600" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">mammals from eating the Chili Peppers</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.010" end="00:30:26.100" style="s2">why because the chili pepper plant gets</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.660" end="00:30:37.980" style="s2">something like a monkey well because the</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.230" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">just finish off the the prediction for</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.179" end="00:30:56.039" style="s2">the story you just told which is a true</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.010" end="00:31:16.470" style="s2">peppers yep</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.789" end="00:31:18.659" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s correct I should have</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.470" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">should have said that all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.659" end="00:31:23.640" style="s2">think except bats that&#39;s all you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s all you have for bats only</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.640" end="00:31:27.870" style="s2">well oh did you want to actually you I</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:29.580" style="s2">thought you might want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.870" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">about the three clades that you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.580" end="00:31:33.480" style="s2">maybe maybe not but you say a similar</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:37.110" style="s2">strain of corona virus is likely and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.480" end="00:31:39.150" style="s2">around alofa de hippo Sarah the hippos</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.110" end="00:31:41.010" style="s2">adarand&#39;s if I said yeah I&#39;ve misspelled</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.150" end="00:31:42.840" style="s2">that and maybe something similar in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.010" end="00:31:45.150" style="s2">Otis maybe this is too too much in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:47.220" style="s2">weeds but no not really all I would say</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.150" end="00:31:48.929" style="s2">is I&#39;m not an expert on the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.220" end="00:31:54.020" style="s2">bats that have been implicated here they</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.929" end="00:31:56.460" style="s2">are old-world insectivores they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.020" end="00:31:58.679" style="s2">potentially good hosts for a virus</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.460" end="00:32:01.650" style="s2">because they many of the species in</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.679" end="00:32:03.690" style="s2">these couple of clades do roost in large</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.650" end="00:32:05.370" style="s2">cave settings where the virus would have</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.690" end="00:32:09.419" style="s2">a better chance of spreading one animal</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.370" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">to the next it is interesting that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.419" end="00:32:14.940" style="s2">have seen analogues of this virus in two</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">closely related families the hippo</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">sedara T and the Rhino Lofa T and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:25.380" style="s2">now a distant family has shown a similar</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">virus this is a species of my Otis and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.380" end="00:32:30.510" style="s2">my Otis is found all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:32.520" style="s2">these actually if you know bats in North</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.510" end="00:32:33.870" style="s2">America it&#39;s almost certainly at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.520" end="00:32:37.110" style="s2">in this family it&#39;s a Vesper Tilley on</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.870" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">it right that&#39;s particularly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.110" end="00:32:43.080" style="s2">up in the northern reaches it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:45.450" style="s2">family that gets to you but but in any</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.080" end="00:32:47.429" style="s2">case one of the things that happens in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.450" end="00:32:49.049" style="s2">these large cave roosts is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.429" end="00:32:51.720" style="s2">frequently many species are roosting</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.049" end="00:32:53.730" style="s2">together and so you can imagine a virus</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.720" end="00:32:55.950" style="s2">that had the special characteristic of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.730" end="00:32:57.660" style="s2">being able to hop from one species to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.950" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">the next and found itself in a roost of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.660" end="00:33:04.410" style="s2">bats that maybe 95% Ryan elephants but</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:08.400" style="s2">has a few myotis here there would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.410" end="00:33:10.950" style="s2">an advantage now this does point to one</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.400" end="00:33:13.410" style="s2">opportunity here which is to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.950" end="00:33:15.630" style="s2">that the virus is good at jumping from</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.410" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">one species to the next it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.630" end="00:33:20.070" style="s2">specialist and therefore from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:21.720" style="s2">perspective of coming up with a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.070" end="00:33:23.429" style="s2">or something that&#39;s actually a hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.720" end="00:33:26.910" style="s2">sign because what it means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.429" end="00:33:28.650" style="s2">mechanisms of adhesion the antigens on</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.910" end="00:33:32.640" style="s2">the surface of infected cells for</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.650" end="00:33:35.400" style="s2">example are going to be generalist in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:37.169" style="s2">nature and that generalism means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.400" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">they are probably a bigger target for us</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.169" end="00:33:41.610" style="s2">to hit with a vaccine yeah so a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:43.650" style="s2">of reasons today that we are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.610" end="00:33:45.809" style="s2">well maybe a vaccine we still should not</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.650" end="00:33:48.150" style="s2">be banking on it it should not be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.809" end="00:33:49.559" style="s2">one and only strategy but maybe it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.150" end="00:33:54.600" style="s2">more likely than we at least were</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.559" end="00:33:56.640" style="s2">thinking a week or two ago yep good okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.600" end="00:33:59.010" style="s2">do you want to launch into conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.640" end="00:34:00.870" style="s2">hypotheses which is the the term that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.010" end="00:34:02.160" style="s2">you invoked the last time and I said</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.870" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no way this is going to catch on</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.160" end="00:34:06.840" style="s2">everyone calls them conspiracy theories</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:08.580" style="s2">but let&#39;s let&#39;s go ahead and try to call</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.840" end="00:34:10.530" style="s2">them conspiracy hypotheses maybe a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.580" end="00:34:12.389" style="s2">words first about why you would rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.530" end="00:34:14.909" style="s2">call them conspiracy hypotheses rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.389" end="00:34:16.679" style="s2">than conspiracy theories sure so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.909" end="00:34:18.270" style="s2">would imagine that Darwinists would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.679" end="00:34:20.940" style="s2">particularly sensitive about this issue</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.270" end="00:34:24.419" style="s2">because sometimes we have to field these</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.940" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">accusations that evolution is only a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.419" end="00:34:28.020" style="s2">theory when in fact when we say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.790" style="s2">evolution is a theory we mean something</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.020" end="00:34:34.830" style="s2">very strong by it which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.790" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">it is a well tested idea it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.830" end="00:34:38.100" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t be displaced by something</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:40.580" style="s2">else but as far as we know evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.100" end="00:34:43.080" style="s2">the explanation for all living creatures</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.580" end="00:34:47.159" style="s2">because it is the only explanation that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.080" end="00:34:49.500" style="s2">has withstood tests so when we say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.159" end="00:34:49.909" style="s2">something is a conspiracy theory we</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.500" end="00:34:52.990" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.909" end="00:34:55.940" style="s2">mean to drag in that level of certitude</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.990" end="00:34:57.740" style="s2">in fact in the case of conspiracies we</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.940" end="00:35:02.230" style="s2">have a significant problem which is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.740" end="00:35:04.970" style="s2">the the whole allegation of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.230" end="00:35:10.270" style="s2">suggests that somebody is trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.970" end="00:35:13.430" style="s2">X look like Y and so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.270" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2">responsibly deal with things in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.430" end="00:35:21.589" style="s2">quadrant we have to be very careful to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:23.809" style="s2">rate our level of certainty and not over</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.589" end="00:35:25.819" style="s2">rate it so to say that something is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.809" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">conspiracy hypothesis leaves open the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.819" end="00:35:28.760" style="s2">possibility that it makes predictions</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.339" style="s2">and that we could discover that it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.760" end="00:35:34.280" style="s2">true but it does not claim that it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.339" end="00:35:37.670" style="s2">true I guess the one risk of using this</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.280" end="00:35:39.980" style="s2">phrase conspiracy hypothesis is that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.670" end="00:35:41.930" style="s2">is it is very common for people to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.980" end="00:35:44.359" style="s2">misunderstand when you say I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.930" end="00:35:45.829" style="s2">hypothesis or here&#39;s a hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.359" end="00:35:47.720" style="s2">what you are in fact saying is I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.829" end="00:35:50.119" style="s2">this is true or I want this to be true</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.720" end="00:35:52.010" style="s2">and sometimes when you say I have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.119" end="00:35:53.569" style="s2">hypothesis you are saying I think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.010" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">is true but that&#39;s not always the case</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.569" end="00:36:00.349" style="s2">you whenever you are confronted with an</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:01.579" style="s2">open question you know why is X you are</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.349" end="00:36:03.200" style="s2">expected to come up with as many</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.579" end="00:36:05.539" style="s2">possible hypotheses as could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:07.789" style="s2">explain X and then discern between them</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.539" end="00:36:09.890" style="s2">and so all of those hypotheses are</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.789" end="00:36:11.930" style="s2">unlikely to reside in your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.890" end="00:36:14.329" style="s2">equally likely to be true although it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.930" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">what you know what we aim for when we</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.329" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">are doing science so saying we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:21.770" style="s2">to talk about some conspiracy hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:23.299" style="s2">does not mean that we think any of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.770" end="00:36:26.809" style="s2">necessarily are true and certainly some</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.299" end="00:36:28.549" style="s2">of them we absolutely don&#39;t but it the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.809" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">term as you&#39;ve already said conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.549" end="00:36:38.180" style="s2">hypothesis reduces the likelihood in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:40.369" style="s2">head of the person speaking that it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.180" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">it is a certainty mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.369" end="00:36:46.190" style="s2">all right so how should we address the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:47.660" style="s2">question of conspiracy hypotheses well I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.190" end="00:36:52.309" style="s2">mean it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.660" end="00:36:54.980" style="s2">happened sorry one of the categories of</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.309" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">conspiracy hypotheses has mostly</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.980" end="00:37:00.410" style="s2">disappeared which is even until a couple</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:02.299" style="s2">weeks ago maybe even a week ago people</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.410" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">were still saying this isn&#39;t real it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:09.110" style="s2">all right and mostly this one has</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.740" end="00:37:10.190" style="s2">disappeared I haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.110" end="00:37:12.950" style="s2">this too much there&#39;s still people</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.190" end="00:37:15.260" style="s2">claiming different levels of hoaxes enos</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.950" end="00:37:17.540" style="s2">but the idea that the entire thing is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.260" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">fabrication and that SARS Cove too</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.550" end="00:37:31.220" style="s2">originally when we were talking about</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.510" end="00:37:52.790" style="s2">right and the idea that this was a hoax</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.880" end="00:37:55.130" style="s2">and from pretty much the beginning was</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.790" end="00:37:57.260" style="s2">kind of crackpot but there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.130" end="00:37:59.870" style="s2">other ideas that don&#39;t fit the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.260" end="00:38:02.360" style="s2">mainstream narrative right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.870" end="00:38:03.910" style="s2">they institutionally that what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.360" end="00:38:08.450" style="s2">what&#39;s the acronym your brother has</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.910" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">which one gin the gin yeah Kate an</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.450" end="00:38:12.170" style="s2">institutional narrative yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">so the gated institutional narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.170" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">one thing we know it&#39;s not been true in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.540" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">some regards so anything that goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:20.570" style="s2">against the Djinn the gated</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:22.190" style="s2">institutional narrative might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.570" end="00:38:23.540" style="s2">considered a conspiracy hypothesis are</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.190" end="00:38:27.260" style="s2">some of them going to be true of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.540" end="00:38:31.130" style="s2">yes yes the Djinn in fact uses the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.260" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">of conspiracy theory to dismiss viable</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.130" end="00:38:34.970" style="s2">ideas right so it calls them a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:37.780" style="s2">conspiracy theory which automatically</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.970" end="00:38:41.180" style="s2">tinges them with this sort of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.780" end="00:38:42.770" style="s2">unhinged wild-eyed connotation right</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.180" end="00:38:46.010" style="s2">which is which is exactly how the game</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.770" end="00:38:48.980" style="s2">is played so I think I think we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.010" end="00:38:50.750" style="s2">need to talk about any of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.980" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t exist that it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.750" end="00:38:54.620" style="s2">right that we&#39;re not experiencing an</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:58.300" style="s2">actual global pandemic or the social</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.620" end="00:39:02.540" style="s2">response is to nothing but beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.300" end="00:39:06.170" style="s2">yeah so let&#39;s let&#39;s just launch into</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.540" end="00:39:08.930" style="s2">some of these things there is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.170" end="00:39:11.330" style="s2">question that routinely comes up which</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.930" end="00:39:14.010" style="s2">has to do with what to make of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.330" end="00:39:17.130" style="s2">that this virus appears to have emerge</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.010" end="00:39:21.230" style="s2">in Wuhan which just so happens to house</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.130" end="00:39:25.500" style="s2">a lab that was studying such viruses</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.230" end="00:39:31.620" style="s2">from bat sources with a possible eye</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.500" end="00:39:34.080" style="s2">towards utilization I must say I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.620" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2">in a position to evaluate any of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.080" end="00:39:37.980" style="s2">facts here I certainly assume that there</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.150" end="00:39:41.820" style="s2">is a viral adji lab that matches this</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.980" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">description and given that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.820" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">case it is a very difficult to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">coincidence it could of course be just</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:54.690" style="s2">coincidence or it could be something</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:57.240" style="s2">more well let&#39;s say there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.690" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">three possibilities right within within</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.240" end="00:40:04.350" style="s2">just this framework it is a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:06.930" style="s2">and this emerged from some clade of bats</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.350" end="00:40:09.600" style="s2">jumped into pangolins or maybe cobra</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.930" end="00:40:12.840" style="s2">like things and then into humans and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.600" end="00:40:14.580" style="s2">fact of their being a competent and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.840" end="00:40:18.030" style="s2">relevant virology lab very close to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.580" end="00:40:20.490" style="s2">Wuhan is a coincidence that&#39;s one - is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.030" end="00:40:23.940" style="s2">at the other end of the spectrum this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.490" end="00:40:26.370" style="s2">in fact a bioweapon produced and and by</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.940" end="00:40:27.840" style="s2">by that lab and they just didn&#39;t take it</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.370" end="00:40:29.250" style="s2">very far it just seems like poor</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.840" end="00:40:31.350" style="s2">planning but okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.250" end="00:40:32.820" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this intermediate one</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.350" end="00:40:34.860" style="s2">which is that there was something in</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.820" end="00:40:36.840" style="s2">development and there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.860" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">actually new wants possible within here</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.840" end="00:40:40.050" style="s2">that there that we there&#39;s actually I</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:41.940" style="s2">don&#39;t think I have it in the notes so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.050" end="00:40:44.850" style="s2">don&#39;t have it for you exact but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.940" end="00:40:46.290" style="s2">a paper from a couple of years ago which</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.850" end="00:40:47.850" style="s2">in which some of the authors are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.290" end="00:40:50.730" style="s2">actually out of that lab in which they</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.850" end="00:40:52.110" style="s2">say look we know from SARS one which of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.730" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">course wasn&#39;t SARS one at that point was</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.110" end="00:40:56.250" style="s2">just being called SARS that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:58.080" style="s2">risk that there&#39;s a reservoir in bats of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.250" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">similar viruses and we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.080" end="00:41:02.280" style="s2">know more about it and here&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:04.260" style="s2">done to try to understand it so we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.280" end="00:41:08.610" style="s2">that that lab was indeed investigating</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.260" end="00:41:10.860" style="s2">SARS like coronaviruses in you know in</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.610" end="00:41:12.990" style="s2">the virology lab in Wuhan within the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.860" end="00:41:15.060" style="s2">last couple of years that is a totally</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.990" end="00:41:17.340" style="s2">legitimate appropriate in fact admirable</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.060" end="00:41:19.110" style="s2">thing forever allergy lab to be doing if</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.340" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">they understand this is a risk that</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.110" end="00:41:24.600" style="s2">could produce a global pandemic were</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:27.000" style="s2">they then or some members of that lab</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.600" end="00:41:30.390" style="s2">considering developing it as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.000" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">weapon that&#39;s a possibility but hard to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.390" end="00:41:35.190" style="s2">hard to know what the likelihood is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">it possible that it escaped by accident</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.190" end="00:41:40.350" style="s2">this is maybe the third sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:42.270" style="s2">middle-of-the-road hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.350" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t match either come on guys it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.270" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">coincidence what are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:49.800" style="s2">or this must be a bio weapon from China</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:51.810" style="s2">and we need to get them so escape could</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.800" end="00:41:54.180" style="s2">mean a number of things it could mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.810" end="00:41:57.240" style="s2">that you know somebody goofed with a</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.180" end="00:41:59.370" style="s2">sample and or something like that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.240" end="00:42:01.410" style="s2">could also mean because what they were</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.370" end="00:42:04.320" style="s2">doing was apparently looking for SARS</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.410" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">like coronaviruses in bats that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.320" end="00:42:09.480" style="s2">were going into caves and that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:11.460" style="s2">in the lab contracted it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.480" end="00:42:13.470" style="s2">they&#39;re working in Wuhan in this lab and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.460" end="00:42:16.500" style="s2">the thing escapes into the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.470" end="00:42:19.410" style="s2">coincidence is too much for people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.500" end="00:42:22.110" style="s2">ignore from the point of view of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:23.930" style="s2">being a bioweapon yeah there are a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.110" end="00:42:26.760" style="s2">couple things I&#39;m more compelled by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.930" end="00:42:28.440" style="s2">argument that it&#39;s not a very well put</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.760" end="00:42:31.140" style="s2">together by a weapon and that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.440" end="00:42:32.520" style="s2">argues against it being one and this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.140" end="00:42:34.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a new paper again I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.520" end="00:42:35.940" style="s2">the reference right here for Zack to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.080" end="00:42:38.670" style="s2">pull up there&#39;s a new paper that says</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.940" end="00:42:41.250" style="s2">definitely not a bio weapon but the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.670" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">argument is primarily this isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.250" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">people who were engineering a bio weapon</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.410" style="s2">would have made and I&#39;m not fully</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.120" style="s2">compelled by this is an argument because</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.410" end="00:42:49.380" style="s2">it imagines that you can see into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.120" end="00:42:51.510" style="s2">minds of people who would be trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.380" end="00:42:53.220" style="s2">engineer bio weapon accurately and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.510" end="00:42:56.100" style="s2">seems like they would be exactly trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.220" end="00:42:57.690" style="s2">to not have their Bynes seen into but it</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.100" end="00:42:59.370" style="s2">is nevertheless an argument that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.690" end="00:43:01.740" style="s2">made in at this point the published</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.370" end="00:43:04.080" style="s2">scientific literature well like I said I</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.740" end="00:43:09.240" style="s2">like this argument a bit better than you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.080" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">do unless there was a Phase two if this</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.240" end="00:43:12.630" style="s2">was a bio weapon then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:14.100" style="s2">sufficient in itself to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.630" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">effective one but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.100" end="00:43:17.370" style="s2">coupled with something else it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:20.100" style="s2">be so I guess the prediction of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.370" end="00:43:23.270" style="s2">hypothesis that it is a bio weapon is</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.100" end="00:43:26.220" style="s2">that there would be some second blow</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.270" end="00:43:28.200" style="s2">that something would emerge it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.220" end="00:43:30.840" style="s2">possible that it was constructed as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.200" end="00:43:32.790" style="s2">bio weapon and that it has evolved</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.840" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">through some mechanism either understood</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.790" end="00:43:37.960" style="s2">or not understood so if we step into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:40.839" style="s2">flu</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.960" end="00:43:44.470" style="s2">like RNA viruses there is a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.839" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">for recombination between viruses that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.470" end="00:43:48.760" style="s2">would allow some novel virus to emerge I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.080" style="s2">don&#39;t believe we know of such</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.760" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">potentially a bio weapon that got away</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.080" end="00:43:54.609" style="s2">from them right well imagine that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">put together a devastating bioweapon and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.609" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">they released it and then evolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.010" style="s2">shuffled it because evolution isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.390" end="00:44:02.500" style="s2">really interested in human bio weapons</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.010" end="00:44:04.180" style="s2">evolution is interested in creatures</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.500" end="00:44:05.830" style="s2">getting into the future and so if it</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.180" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">quickly changed into a form that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.830" end="00:44:09.580" style="s2">more effective at being passed and less</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:11.859" style="s2">effective at doing whatever devastation</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.580" end="00:44:13.570" style="s2">then that would be a win from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.859" end="00:44:16.420" style="s2">evolutionary perspective and it would</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.570" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">upend the intent of whoever created it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.420" end="00:44:25.180" style="s2">but I should say were you in wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:27.790" style="s2">creating a bio weapon it would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.180" end="00:44:29.740" style="s2">foolish to release it there this is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.790" end="00:44:31.330" style="s2">I was trying to suggest earlier they</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.740" end="00:44:33.310" style="s2">really didn&#39;t take it very far did they</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.330" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">right they didn&#39;t they&#39;d put it right in</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.310" end="00:44:37.240" style="s2">their backyard if if this is where they</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.920" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">developed and this is where it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.240" end="00:44:41.349" style="s2">released and I mean at risk of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">into even more dangerous territory than</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.349" end="00:44:44.770" style="s2">were already in the idea that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:47.609" style="s2">engineer something and have total</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.770" end="00:44:50.950" style="s2">control over it is obviously hubris of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.609" end="00:44:54.040" style="s2">the nth degree and is exactly the reason</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.950" end="00:44:57.010" style="s2">that we have a much more cautious and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.040" end="00:44:59.140" style="s2">nuanced dare I say take on gently</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.010" end="00:45:02.080" style="s2">modified organisms then most scientists</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.140" end="00:45:04.030" style="s2">are supposed to because you just cannot</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.080" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">assume that the thing that you put out</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.030" end="00:45:08.140" style="s2">into the world will stay as it was if</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:10.300" style="s2">it&#39;s an evolved in entity yeah if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.140" end="00:45:13.750" style="s2">an evolving entity then it may have</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.300" end="00:45:15.550" style="s2">other plans now were you somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.750" end="00:45:18.970" style="s2">who wanted to create a bio weapon and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.550" end="00:45:20.589" style="s2">you wanted the blame to fall on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.970" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">Chinese for example you might release it</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.589" end="00:45:26.109" style="s2">in Wuhan and then people would be unable</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:28.869" style="s2">to ignore the the coincidence but</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.109" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">nonetheless I would say I&#39;m far I&#39;m far</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.869" end="00:45:33.940" style="s2">more compelled by the idea that it got</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:35.619" style="s2">away from somebody who was associated</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.940" end="00:45:37.510" style="s2">with this lab and that that&#39;s the reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.619" end="00:45:39.670" style="s2">but which I&#39;m sorry to interrupt but</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.510" end="00:45:40.930" style="s2">which says nothing about the intention</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.670" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">of the people who are working on it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.930" end="00:45:45.910" style="s2">right it it could have been the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:48.700" style="s2">honorable Public Health driven work out</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.910" end="00:45:49.240" style="s2">there and it could have been totally</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.700" end="00:45:50.770" style="s2">execrable</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.240" end="00:45:51.299" style="s2">and there&#39;s no there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.770" end="00:45:53.849" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.299" end="00:45:56.039" style="s2">this story as it escaped from a lab as</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.849" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">to which of those are anywhere in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.039" end="00:46:00.029" style="s2">spectrum it might have been oh yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.919" style="s2">anyway I think the important thing if</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.029" end="00:46:04.649" style="s2">you&#39;re going to traffic in conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.919" end="00:46:08.130" style="s2">hypotheses is to recognize that at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.649" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">moment we don&#39;t have sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.130" end="00:46:11.939" style="s2">information to sort between these</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.319" end="00:46:14.609" style="s2">various things all we can do is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.939" end="00:46:16.229" style="s2">say the chances that the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.609" end="00:46:18.569" style="s2">developed a bioweapon in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.229" end="00:46:20.489" style="s2">kovat 19 and released it in Wuhan</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.569" end="00:46:22.349" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really add up it doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.489" end="00:46:24.329" style="s2">very well with the virus it doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.349" end="00:46:26.729" style="s2">very well with the release in Wuhan why</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.329" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">would they do that rather than transport</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.729" end="00:46:30.719" style="s2">it which is obviously easily done could</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:32.609" style="s2">somebody else have transported it there</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.719" end="00:46:34.799" style="s2">so that the viral og lab would take the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.609" end="00:46:37.049" style="s2">blame conceivably but again it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.799" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">very well constructed did it evolve out</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.049" end="00:46:40.380" style="s2">from under somebody did they build a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:43.799" style="s2">weapon that then evolved into something</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.380" end="00:46:45.959" style="s2">much more benign who knows but and again</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.799" end="00:46:48.359" style="s2">just a just a circle back a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.959" end="00:46:51.269" style="s2">all of these are conspiracy hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.359" end="00:46:54.390" style="s2">only because they are outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.269" end="00:46:56.429" style="s2">gated institutional narrative yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.390" end="00:46:58.619" style="s2">mean I would say their hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.429" end="00:47:00.209" style="s2">but I mean so the point is that that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.619" end="00:47:04.079" style="s2">Djinn yeah the gate institutional</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.209" end="00:47:05.669" style="s2">narrative makes rogue of hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.079" end="00:47:08.159" style="s2">anything that doesn&#39;t fit but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.669" end="00:47:11.209" style="s2">already telling you is true and so this</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.159" end="00:47:13.049" style="s2">is we are we&#39;re trying to be thorough</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.209" end="00:47:14.759" style="s2">recognizing that there is so much</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.049" end="00:47:16.889" style="s2">information we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.759" end="00:47:18.989" style="s2">information that we do have is changing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.889" end="00:47:21.479" style="s2">regularly and we don&#39;t know if the new</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.989" end="00:47:24.209" style="s2">or the old is actually true but we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.479" end="00:47:27.089" style="s2">trying to sort of walk this weave this</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.209" end="00:47:28.799" style="s2">line through all the information and</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.089" end="00:47:31.849" style="s2">almost none of the things that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.799" end="00:47:34.639" style="s2">talked about here are part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.849" end="00:47:37.339" style="s2">are being told by our government or</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.639" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">public health leaders and this is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.339" end="00:47:42.419" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s several things contributing</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:47.159" style="s2">to the problems with what we are being</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.419" end="00:47:48.899" style="s2">told one the data is truly crappy right</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.159" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">we don&#39;t have good data because the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.899" end="00:47:52.769" style="s2">testing isn&#39;t high quality it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:54.899" style="s2">widely distributed and that&#39;s resulting</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.769" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">in an extremely noisy data set that may</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.899" end="00:47:57.209" style="s2">be more misleading than it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:47:59.880" style="s2">informative</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.209" end="00:48:02.099" style="s2">having nothing to do with human failures</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.880" end="00:48:04.859" style="s2">though also given how high a rate of</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.099" end="00:48:08.069" style="s2">asymptomatic carriers there seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.859" end="00:48:10.440" style="s2">absent worldwide testing of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.069" end="00:48:12.239" style="s2">yesterday the data will inherently be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.440" end="00:48:14.489" style="s2">bad no matter how good any particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.239" end="00:48:17.220" style="s2">government had been about developing in</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.489" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">disseminating tests yeah so the data is</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.220" end="00:48:25.410" style="s2">crappy the political apparatus has gone</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:27.299" style="s2">into high gear making use of the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.410" end="00:48:30.989" style="s2">and this is something that should worry</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.299" end="00:48:34.799" style="s2">us tremendously so among other things we</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.989" end="00:48:37.880" style="s2">have seen a continuation I believe it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.799" end="00:48:41.160" style="s2">has not passed but have you&#39;ve seen an</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.880" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">attempt to broaden the appalling</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.160" end="00:48:48.989" style="s2">provisions of the NDAA 2012 for</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:50.759" style="s2">indefinite detention and when NDA 2012</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.989" end="00:48:54.799" style="s2">passed the indefinite detention was</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.759" end="00:48:58.200" style="s2">specifically with reference to a</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.799" end="00:49:00.390" style="s2">worldwide war on terrorism and in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.200" end="00:49:04.650" style="s2">case what we&#39;ve seen is a legislative</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.390" end="00:49:07.739" style="s2">attempt to broaden it to any crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.650" end="00:49:08.789" style="s2">we should look we should look this up</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.739" end="00:49:11.009" style="s2">and we should come back to this on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.789" end="00:49:12.869" style="s2">next livestream it might have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.009" end="00:49:14.940" style="s2">extending it specifically to a public</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.869" end="00:49:17.460" style="s2">health crisis and I thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.940" end="00:49:19.739" style="s2">explicitly extending it to judicial</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.460" end="00:49:21.690" style="s2">branch maybe or maybe that wasn&#39;t part</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.739" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">of it we should we should get back that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.690" end="00:49:26.609" style="s2">we should figure it out but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:28.890" style="s2">there it does seem to be a number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.609" end="00:49:31.410" style="s2">different fronts in which the chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.890" end="00:49:33.900" style="s2">this is creating has opened a door for</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.410" end="00:49:36.150" style="s2">some agenda that clearly existed</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.900" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">beforehand to move forward while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.150" end="00:49:44.220" style="s2">all occupied thinking about viruses so</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:47.069" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a very destructive process</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.220" end="00:49:50.339" style="s2">and independent of the simple fact that</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.069" end="00:49:52.200" style="s2">the data isn&#39;t any good and then the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.339" end="00:49:53.910" style="s2">third but maybe this is actually just an</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.200" end="00:49:55.230" style="s2">extension of the data not being very</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.910" end="00:50:00.680" style="s2">good but I&#39;ve started to see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.230" end="00:50:03.989" style="s2">analyses about how we are incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.680" end="00:50:07.319" style="s2">categorizing various things like death</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.989" end="00:50:10.519" style="s2">by Cove at 19 and I want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.319" end="00:50:13.470" style="s2">little detour here and just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.519" end="00:50:14.760" style="s2">lodge an idea in the public</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.470" end="00:50:18.270" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.760" end="00:50:21.030" style="s2">we hear a lot in other circumstances of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.270" end="00:50:24.330" style="s2">people dying of the flu right old people</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.030" end="00:50:27.480" style="s2">very frequently die of the flu but dying</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.330" end="00:50:30.270" style="s2">of the flu isn&#39;t really what happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.480" end="00:50:31.950" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got is a situation some of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.270" end="00:50:34.850" style="s2">you won&#39;t know that I worked on</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.950" end="00:50:38.070" style="s2">telomeres back in graduate school and</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.850" end="00:50:40.710" style="s2">telomeres are the ends of chromosomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.070" end="00:50:43.590" style="s2">which have a repetitive sequence that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.710" end="00:50:45.810" style="s2">basically functions like a timer it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.590" end="00:50:49.020" style="s2">eroded slightly with each cell division</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.810" end="00:50:50.970" style="s2">so every time you get damaged or you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.020" end="00:50:52.350" style="s2">maintenance you lose a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.970" end="00:50:55.590" style="s2">this telomere and eventually your cells</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.350" end="00:50:58.470" style="s2">can&#39;t reproduce which causes you to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.590" end="00:51:03.690" style="s2">you know your organs begin to fail this</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.470" end="00:51:07.500" style="s2">is what growing old is about when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.690" end="00:51:09.500" style="s2">are born you have effectively a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.500" end="00:51:12.750" style="s2">capacity to do repair for a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.500" end="00:51:15.000" style="s2">when you get damaged you spend some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.750" end="00:51:18.690" style="s2">that capacity if you do damage to one</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.000" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">tissue repetitively you can die of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.690" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">failure of that tissue even if the rest</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:25.470" style="s2">of you is effectively young when we say</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:27.180" style="s2">people have died of the flu what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.470" end="00:51:29.400" style="s2">done is they&#39;ve gotten old and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.180" end="00:51:31.260" style="s2">spent most of their capacity for repair</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.400" end="00:51:33.780" style="s2">and then the flu has pushed them over</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.260" end="00:51:35.940" style="s2">the edge it has pushed some organ beyond</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.780" end="00:51:37.290" style="s2">a limit and that has caused their death</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.940" end="00:51:39.540" style="s2">but the fact that their death</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.290" end="00:51:43.410" style="s2">certificate says flu and it doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.540" end="00:51:45.720" style="s2">you know old age by flu right those two</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.410" end="00:51:47.580" style="s2">things multiplied by each other is</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.720" end="00:51:50.250" style="s2">really what killed the person this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.580" end="00:51:51.780" style="s2">this is exactly why diseases in the case</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.250" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">of kovat 19 it doesn&#39;t seem to affect</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.780" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2">the very young in terms of killing them</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">but there&#39;s a separate reason why</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:52:01.590" style="s2">diseases tend to affect the very young</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.220" end="00:52:03.240" style="s2">and the very old most that those of us</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.590" end="00:52:07.050" style="s2">in the middle of our lives are less</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.240" end="00:52:10.500" style="s2">likely to be taken out by by pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.050" end="00:52:12.420" style="s2">but it really doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.500" end="00:52:14.490" style="s2">walked away from it just because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.420" end="00:52:17.190" style="s2">recovered so the fact that old people</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.490" end="00:52:19.410" style="s2">are pushed over the line and end up dead</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.190" end="00:52:21.240" style="s2">as a result of these things he is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.410" end="00:52:23.940" style="s2">proxy for the fact that it is doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.240" end="00:52:26.010" style="s2">substantial damage right it is spending</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.940" end="00:52:28.230" style="s2">your lifetime capacity to fix some</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.010" end="00:52:30.510" style="s2">tissue like</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.230" end="00:52:32.369" style="s2">so we we should assume that that is just</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.510" end="00:52:33.869" style="s2">simply going on and it&#39;s we should</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.369" end="00:52:36.750" style="s2">assume that it is going on with the flu</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.869" end="00:52:39.510" style="s2">you get the flu you recover you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.750" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">knocked some capacity off of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.510" end="00:52:46.500" style="s2">lifetime total nothing is no cost right</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:47.849" style="s2">there&#39;s lifetime cost that you are you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.500" end="00:52:49.740" style="s2">are taking a hit every time you get sick</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.849" end="00:52:52.790" style="s2">you are taking a hit and you&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.740" end="00:52:54.990" style="s2">some of your total repair capacity but</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.790" end="00:52:57.000" style="s2">in any case the reason that this comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.990" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">up is that in the case of kovat 19</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.000" end="00:53:01.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a temptation to figure out you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:04.349" style="s2">know in the absence of good data there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.530" end="00:53:08.310" style="s2">a temptation to find all data and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.349" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">people who die are being tested where</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.310" end="00:53:12.780" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t died are not so</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:14.430" style="s2">likely to be tested and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.780" end="00:53:16.530" style="s2">we&#39;re catching a lot of cases in which</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.430" end="00:53:18.180" style="s2">somebody was infected but they may have</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.530" end="00:53:20.760" style="s2">had other pathologies I&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.180" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">described in several places now and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.760" end="00:53:26.839" style="s2">is resulting in that&#39;s not even noisy</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:29.190" style="s2">data that&#39;s systematically biased data</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.839" end="00:53:30.420" style="s2">where if you&#39;ve died we&#39;re much more</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.190" end="00:53:32.220" style="s2">likely to figure out that you had</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.420" end="00:53:36.540" style="s2">covered 19 than if you&#39;re still alive</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:38.700" style="s2">and so it&#39;s creating a bias that we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.540" end="00:53:41.220" style="s2">to be aware of this reminds me of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.700" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">you discovered with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.220" end="00:53:47.550" style="s2">hunting abilities of our cat Crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:49.530" style="s2">when you ran an entire 75 person</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.550" end="00:53:50.940" style="s2">introductory biology lab based on his</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.530" end="00:53:52.290" style="s2">kills let me just set it up and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.940" end="00:53:55.050" style="s2">have you tell the story so we had this</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.290" end="00:53:56.190" style="s2">cat whom we&#39;d gotten as a 10 month old</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.050" end="00:53:57.960" style="s2">he&#39;d been on the streets he was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.190" end="00:54:00.570" style="s2">stone-cold killer total sweetheart with</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.960" end="00:54:02.099" style="s2">us but a stone-cold killer and he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.570" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">one of few cats we&#39;ve had who we just we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.099" end="00:54:05.490" style="s2">could not always get inside at night</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.080" end="00:54:09.030" style="s2">he&#39;d go and walk about for days at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.490" end="00:54:11.369" style="s2">time and he&#39;d he&#39;d bring us things he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.030" end="00:54:12.930" style="s2">bring us animals and we discouraged it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.369" end="00:54:16.200" style="s2">but it was very hard to train this cat</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.930" end="00:54:18.060" style="s2">and as biologists are want to do when</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.200" end="00:54:19.140" style="s2">the animals came in in good shape we</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.060" end="00:54:21.300" style="s2">bagged him and put him in our freezer</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.140" end="00:54:22.890" style="s2">because that&#39;s what we did so at some</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.300" end="00:54:25.890" style="s2">point our chest freezer being rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.890" end="00:54:28.820" style="s2">more full of dead crenshaw kills than it</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.890" end="00:54:31.170" style="s2">was of the half a cow that we&#39;d bought</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.820" end="00:54:32.940" style="s2">Brett who was at that point teaching</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.170" end="00:54:35.460" style="s2">introduction of natural science I</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.940" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">believe it was and had 75 students said</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.460" end="00:54:40.230" style="s2">why did I run an entire lab having my</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:42.690" style="s2">students to set these animals</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.230" end="00:54:45.480" style="s2">let&#39;s clear out of freezer get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.690" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">the cat kills and see what we find it</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.480" end="00:54:51.809" style="s2">was mostly mammals a few birds a snake</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:56.339" style="s2">or two maybe and go for it so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.809" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">which I I still find stunning but did</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.339" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">not think to predict was that something</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:05.609" style="s2">like two thirds of the animals that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:07.349" style="s2">students detected had a completely</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.609" end="00:55:10.170" style="s2">obvious pathology</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.349" end="00:55:13.730" style="s2">I remember one in particular was a Robin</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.170" end="00:55:16.200" style="s2">and its lungs were full of this powder</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.730" end="00:55:17.790" style="s2">right and I mean it&#39;s just amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.200" end="00:55:21.180" style="s2">the animal was still walking around at</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.790" end="00:55:23.130" style="s2">the point it was killed and so the I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.180" end="00:55:24.660" style="s2">mean presumably some of the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.130" end="00:55:26.940" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a pathology that an</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.660" end="00:55:28.740" style="s2">undergraduate could diagnose still had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.940" end="00:55:30.540" style="s2">pathology was just you know how would</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.740" end="00:55:33.569" style="s2">you know an animal that had a leukemia</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.540" end="00:55:35.430" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t be able to spot it but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.569" end="00:55:37.619" style="s2">mean you had animals with lots of little</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.430" end="00:55:39.480" style="s2">tumors like many many obvious tumors</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.619" end="00:55:42.210" style="s2">throughout the bodies of many of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.480" end="00:55:44.160" style="s2">animals right yep they had very</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">interesting pathologies but the upshot</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:48.809" style="s2">of this was that this cat was a very</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:50.970" style="s2">good hunter but that he was clearly</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.809" end="00:55:53.700" style="s2">ending up with animals who had been</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.970" end="00:55:55.049" style="s2">compromised by some other force right</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.700" end="00:55:57.059" style="s2">they were made vulnerable by some</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.049" end="00:56:00.210" style="s2">pathology and then the cat ends up</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.059" end="00:56:05.220" style="s2">bringing them home and so anyway it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.210" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">very much like that you know flew by old</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.220" end="00:56:12.690" style="s2">age interaction is you know did the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:14.369" style="s2">animal die of being hunted by a cat or</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.690" end="00:56:16.109" style="s2">did it die of a pathology actually had</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.369" end="00:56:18.510" style="s2">died by the interaction of them exactly</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.109" end="00:56:22.920" style="s2">so yes it is a it is an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.510" end="00:56:25.319" style="s2">parallel yeah all right enough enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.920" end="00:56:26.940" style="s2">conspiracy talk for the time being yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.319" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">I think right what what time are we had</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.940" end="00:56:31.770" style="s2">50 minutes all right that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.490" end="00:56:33.180" style="s2">do we want to so last time I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.770" end="00:56:34.230" style="s2">that we wanted to say a couple words</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.180" end="00:56:36.660" style="s2">about the Works Progress Administration</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.230" end="00:56:38.190" style="s2">and I started off thinking it was the</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.660" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">40s and I was kind of right and then I</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.190" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">went forward whether in the back you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:43.710" style="s2">said the thirties I was I was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:45.750" style="s2">about that so this is this was</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.710" end="00:56:47.460" style="s2">introduced by FDR as part of the New</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.750" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">Deal the Works Progress Administration</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.460" end="00:56:56.500" style="s2">in 1935 and mostly killed in Cong</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:57:00.280" style="s2">by 1943 as we were at war 3 million jobs</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.500" end="00:57:01.990" style="s2">out of 10 million jobless Americans</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.280" end="00:57:05.560" style="s2">during the Depression ended up with jobs</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.990" end="00:57:08.710" style="s2">through the WPA alone and WPA workers</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.560" end="00:57:10.540" style="s2">built highways and schools and</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.710" end="00:57:13.750" style="s2">playgrounds and hospitals they restored</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.540" end="00:57:16.210" style="s2">theatres and lodges they put creatives</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.770" end="00:57:31.600" style="s2">four weeks ago as it was becoming clear</p>

<p begin="00:57:31.600" end="00:57:37.540" style="s2">coming at the same moment that large</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.300" end="00:57:39.690" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a federally sponsored project</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.540" end="00:57:43.470" style="s2">of course but near our house there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.690" end="00:57:45.610" style="s2">long in the planning piece of work</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.470" end="00:57:48.490" style="s2">infrastructure work that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.610" end="00:57:50.470" style="s2">began yesterday that&#39;s slated to be to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.490" end="00:57:53.530" style="s2">go on for seven or more months and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.470" end="00:57:55.750" style="s2">is causing huge traffic rerouting and</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.530" end="00:57:57.970" style="s2">you know it&#39;s got a snarl traffic a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.750" end="00:58:00.130" style="s2">tremendous amount for for many many</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.970" end="00:58:02.620" style="s2">months to be done it&#39;s a new bridge</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.130" end="00:58:05.560" style="s2">that&#39;s being put in both to facilitate</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:14.470" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to have their habitat</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.040" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">restored as people are being granted</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.470" end="00:58:19.870" style="s2">access to walk under the bridge rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:22.120" style="s2">than across this busy road in order to</p>

<p begin="00:58:22.120" end="00:58:27.550" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s a terrific project</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.730" end="00:58:30.280" style="s2">that needs to be done and of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.550" end="00:58:32.080" style="s2">going to cause disruption we received</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.280" end="00:58:34.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve been receiving notices about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.080" end="00:58:36.370" style="s2">for months telling us about how you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.570" end="00:58:39.160" style="s2">the traffic calming measures and how</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.370" end="00:58:41.950" style="s2">traffic is can be rerouted the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.160" end="00:58:44.380" style="s2">recent thing that we received maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.950" end="00:58:46.630" style="s2">couple weeks ago seemed apologetic in</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.380" end="00:58:48.010" style="s2">tone you know we said you know we know</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.630" end="00:58:50.500" style="s2">we know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.010" end="00:58:52.960" style="s2">covered 19 is happening but we really</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.500" end="00:58:56.800" style="s2">think we need to continue on and do this</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.960" end="00:58:59.230" style="s2">and my thought was why on earth are you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.800" end="00:59:01.630" style="s2">apologizing why is the city of Portland</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.230" end="00:59:02.980" style="s2">apologizing for continuing with a</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.140" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">being paid for by bonds or what but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.760" end="00:59:11.740" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it got the funding somehow</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">it is widely understood to be important</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.740" end="00:59:17.590" style="s2">and valuable and it is scheduled for now</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:20.619" style="s2">at a moment when many people are losing</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.590" end="00:59:23.530" style="s2">their jobs or they have less work than</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.619" end="00:59:25.390" style="s2">they have had in the past and at the you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.530" end="00:59:28.180" style="s2">know the the lowest level of importance</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.390" end="00:59:29.650" style="s2">here of all moments to be doing work</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.180" end="00:59:31.090" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be disruptive of traffic</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.650" end="00:59:33.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t this exactly the moment to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.090" end="00:59:35.260" style="s2">beginning it right where there is almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.310" end="00:59:36.460" style="s2">no traffic anyway and where people will</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.260" end="00:59:38.320" style="s2">be the least disrupted because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.460" end="00:59:40.810" style="s2">already so massively disrupted by the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.320" end="00:59:42.850" style="s2">lockdowns that are in place and organism</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.810" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">as in so many other places in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.850" end="00:59:49.060" style="s2">country so it&#39;s not the same as WPA but</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:50.619" style="s2">it got us thinking but this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.060" end="00:59:53.830" style="s2">exactly the moment that you know there</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.619" end="00:59:57.310" style="s2">is going to be vast economic fallout</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.830" end="00:59:58.420" style="s2">from the societal measures to flatten</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.310" end="01:00:00.520" style="s2">the curve that have been put in place</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.420" end="01:00:01.930" style="s2">the important necessary societal</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.520" end="01:00:05.140" style="s2">measures have been put in place to</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.930" end="01:00:06.940" style="s2">flatten the curve but there are people</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.140" end="01:00:08.320" style="s2">who are hurting and there are systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.940" end="01:00:11.100" style="s2">that are going to fail and lots of small</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.320" end="01:00:15.700" style="s2">businesses put out of business and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.100" end="01:00:18.970" style="s2">something like WPA for the modern era</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.700" end="01:00:22.180" style="s2">could fix our infrastructure rebuild our</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.970" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">arts and sciences and get a number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.180" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">things back coming again the way they</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:29.830" style="s2">haven&#39;t in a long time</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:32.140" style="s2">yeah so if you put this up against the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.830" end="01:00:34.680" style="s2">very stimulus packages that have been</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.140" end="01:00:37.450" style="s2">proposed where people are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.680" end="01:00:39.369" style="s2">given some infusion of cash those things</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.450" end="01:00:41.500" style="s2">are good and it&#39;s necessary that</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.369" end="01:00:44.020" style="s2">something be done because so many people</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.500" end="01:00:46.060" style="s2">have been sidelined but something that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.020" end="01:00:47.730" style="s2">did double duty where people were put to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.060" end="01:00:49.869" style="s2">work doing things that were</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.730" end="01:00:52.810" style="s2">epidemiologically safe for them to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.869" end="01:00:54.430" style="s2">things that need doing and are being</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.810" end="01:00:58.900" style="s2">paid for it would be a very positive</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.430" end="01:01:03.369" style="s2">thing I have a concern I&#39;ve seen over my</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.900" end="01:01:05.740" style="s2">lifetime a paranoia in some political</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.369" end="01:01:08.920" style="s2">circles about letting the government do</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.740" end="01:01:11.109" style="s2">anything effective and that the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.920" end="01:01:14.970" style="s2">interpretation that I can come up with</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.109" end="01:01:18.630" style="s2">is that there is a desire for people</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.970" end="01:01:21.000" style="s2">to prevent there&#39;s a desire on in some</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.630" end="01:01:23.550" style="s2">quadrants to prevent functional</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.000" end="01:01:27.120" style="s2">government so people don&#39;t remember that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.550" end="01:01:28.920" style="s2">government is important so if you live</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.120" end="01:01:31.620" style="s2">in some industry where you fear</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.920" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">governmental regulation then getting rid</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.620" end="01:01:37.290" style="s2">of government by rendering it feeble and</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:40.320" style="s2">ineffective and then declaring it a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.290" end="01:01:44.040" style="s2">waste of money is a strategy and at this</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.320" end="01:01:46.950" style="s2">moment we can&#39;t afford for those voices</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.040" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">to hold sway we actually have to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.950" end="01:01:51.420" style="s2">government wield it effectively because</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">frankly there&#39;s no other way out of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.420" end="01:01:59.880" style="s2">predicament that&#39;s right so I guess one</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:04.790" style="s2">three three final points before before</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.880" end="01:02:07.800" style="s2">you sign off our governments should be</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.790" end="01:02:09.300" style="s2">getting testing of both sorts both the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.800" end="01:02:11.610" style="s2">so called molecular testing and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.300" end="01:02:13.110" style="s2">serology testing underway and widespread</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.610" end="01:02:14.580" style="s2">as quickly as possible we see</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.110" end="01:02:16.950" style="s2">conflicting reports as to whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.580" end="01:02:19.080" style="s2">that&#39;s happening I think mostly it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.950" end="01:02:20.460" style="s2">but I have high hopes that the various</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.080" end="01:02:22.290" style="s2">labs that are working on it are making</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.460" end="01:02:24.030" style="s2">progress what happens then with regard</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.290" end="01:02:26.040" style="s2">to the supply chain and getting them to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.030" end="01:02:29.400" style="s2">people I don&#39;t know that I hope it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.040" end="01:02:33.810" style="s2">happens quickly we need to keep keep and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.400" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">get support systems up and running I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.810" end="01:02:41.130" style="s2">in contact with a with an acquaintance</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:44.510" style="s2">of ours who has a you know in Oregon who</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.130" end="01:02:48.180" style="s2">was trying to make her way through the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.510" end="01:02:49.740" style="s2">the latest bill that specifies what what</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.180" end="01:02:51.060" style="s2">the lockdown means and who has to shut</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.740" end="01:02:54.090" style="s2">down and all this and she&#39;s got a small</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.060" end="01:02:56.850" style="s2">business she&#39;s raising herself into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.090" end="01:02:59.790" style="s2">middle class but she&#39;s not allowed to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.850" end="01:03:01.380" style="s2">her business for now and she&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.790" end="01:03:04.920" style="s2">figure out if she&#39;s allowed to apply for</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.380" end="01:03:07.890" style="s2">unemployment given that she wants to</p>

<p begin="01:03:07.890" end="01:03:13.110" style="s2">ends and what she said to me was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.430" end="01:03:15.690" style="s2">hoping that support systems will work</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.110" end="01:03:17.760" style="s2">right now and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.690" end="01:03:21.120" style="s2">big thing here is that we need the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.760" end="01:03:23.190" style="s2">extent functional systems to work and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.120" end="01:03:26.040" style="s2">that I fear that there is a concern</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.190" end="01:03:28.520" style="s2">among some that if support systems</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.040" end="01:03:30.680" style="s2">cannot collect everyone apps</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.520" end="01:03:32.420" style="s2">everyone that they should not be</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.680" end="01:03:34.340" style="s2">employed to help the majority and this</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.420" end="01:03:36.020" style="s2">seems anti-democratic so there is</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.340" end="01:03:37.430" style="s2">legitimate concern for people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.020" end="01:03:39.890" style="s2">homeless for people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.430" end="01:03:41.570" style="s2">enough to eat you know how it is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.890" end="01:03:45.380" style="s2">their extant support systems can help</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.570" end="01:03:47.270" style="s2">them but we we need to be using the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.380" end="01:03:48.920" style="s2">support systems that are there to keep</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.270" end="01:03:51.650" style="s2">for instance small business people from</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.650" end="01:03:56.990" style="s2">back on your point about the homeless</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.850" end="01:03:59.210" style="s2">yeah as I&#39;ve been moving around the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.990" end="01:04:02.500" style="s2">world we have a lot of homeless here in</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.210" end="01:04:07.550" style="s2">Portland as are in every major American</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:11.000" style="s2">city that I know of there are a couple</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.000" end="01:04:16.900" style="s2">that these homeless encampments and</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.010" end="01:04:21.080" style="s2">they&#39;re everywhere are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.900" end="01:04:22.820" style="s2">centers of epidemiological spread the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.080" end="01:04:26.030" style="s2">information that circulates among the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.820" end="01:04:28.190" style="s2">homeless is certain to be a dim shadow</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.030" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2">of what the rest of us have access to so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.190" end="01:04:33.860" style="s2">knowing how to control the spread is</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:35.600" style="s2">liable to be difficult for them to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.860" end="01:04:37.970" style="s2">figure out they also don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.600" end="01:04:40.250" style="s2">have the means right if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.970" end="01:04:41.480" style="s2">running water then this becomes a much</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.250" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">more complicated problem so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.480" end="01:04:47.870" style="s2">likely to be a special epidemic inside</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:49.250" style="s2">of these encampments the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.870" end="01:04:52.760" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking about though as</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.250" end="01:04:55.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched the city absolutely shut</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.760" end="01:04:56.930" style="s2">down is for the first time in my life</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.100" end="01:04:59.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve started to think about what these</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.930" end="01:05:02.660" style="s2">folks eat under normal circumstances and</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.390" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">I can&#39;t escape the sense that probably</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.660" end="01:05:07.550" style="s2">most of what they&#39;re eating is food</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:10.100" style="s2">that&#39;s being thrown away by other people</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.550" end="01:05:12.290" style="s2">and if other people are not at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.100" end="01:05:14.270" style="s2">fast-food restaurants throwing away a</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.290" end="01:05:17.900" style="s2">half a burger here a half a burger their</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.270" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">trucks then I&#39;m imagining starvation is</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.900" end="01:05:23.660" style="s2">actually going to be a special problem</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.260" end="01:05:25.780" style="s2">and starting weeks ago as people were</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.660" end="01:05:27.560" style="s2">beginning to be shy about going to these</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.780" end="01:05:30.680" style="s2">establishments that they would usually</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.560" end="01:05:32.360" style="s2">frequent did the food supply that these</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.680" end="01:05:35.750" style="s2">people have been quietly depending on</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.360" end="01:05:38.300" style="s2">suddenly dry up and if so what&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.750" end="01:05:39.950" style="s2">place especially in concert with what we</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.300" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">know to be true which is that food banks</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.950" end="01:05:43.510" style="s2">are having a hard time staffing</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:44.800" style="s2">whether or not there&#39;s food if they</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.510" end="01:05:47.260" style="s2">can&#39;t staff them they&#39;re not there to</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.800" end="01:05:49.900" style="s2">give that food you know yeah so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.260" end="01:05:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s always a puzzle that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.900" end="01:05:56.230" style="s2">deserves more thought than we give it</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.000" end="01:05:58.360" style="s2">and in this case quadruple e so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.230" end="01:05:59.740" style="s2">one more point on my list here Zack</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.360" end="01:06:02.170" style="s2">could you pull up the Willamette week</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.350" end="01:06:53.800" style="s2">a gorgeous 85 or so mile stretch of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.590" end="01:06:57.430" style="s2">natural landscape that is truly diverse</p>

<p begin="01:06:57.430" end="01:07:02.680" style="s2">extraordinary and the it&#39;s the Forest</p>

<p begin="01:07:08.800" end="01:07:12.790" style="s2">this I thought I didn&#39;t even know they</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.360" end="01:07:14.830" style="s2">had that right I thought these were</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.830" end="01:07:20.740" style="s2">lands belong to us so I have two strong</p>

<p begin="01:07:22.900" end="01:07:26.200" style="s2">think that it&#39;s not they&#39;re not even</p>

<p begin="01:07:43.990" end="01:07:48.250" style="s2">prompted by the fact that the order that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.670" end="01:07:50.470" style="s2">came down last week I guess in Oregon</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.250" end="01:07:53.620" style="s2">closed all the state parks and all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.470" end="01:07:55.250" style="s2">day use parks so already people have</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.620" end="01:07:57.020" style="s2">almost no place to go</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.250" end="01:07:58.940" style="s2">be outside in the nature which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.020" end="01:08:00.500" style="s2">exactly the thing that people are going</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.500" end="01:08:06.410" style="s2">longer this goes on I mean it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.020" end="01:08:08.600" style="s2">patently insane and counterproductive to</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.410" end="01:08:10.100" style="s2">keep people locked in the side where</p>

<p begin="01:08:34.040" end="01:08:37.430" style="s2">of this much less healthy much less</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.020" end="01:08:39.859" style="s2">happy much less able to be productive</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.430" end="01:08:42.500" style="s2">when we&#39;re creating a needless</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.500" end="01:08:51.290" style="s2">now it does strike me as probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.240" end="01:08:54.470" style="s2">motivated by the concerns of a litigious</p>

<p begin="01:08:54.470" end="01:08:58.400" style="s2">leave the state parks open but you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.100" end="01:09:07.339" style="s2">question that has to be addressed but it</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.930" end="01:09:09.529" style="s2">does seem to me this is like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.339" end="01:09:12.740" style="s2">addressable to me it&#39;s addressable some</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.529" end="01:09:16.850" style="s2">parks better than others but you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.740" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">at the very least you know put rules up</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.850" end="01:09:20.990" style="s2">at the front that say this you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:23.720" style="s2">way they do off trail at a ski resort</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.990" end="01:09:25.549" style="s2">they say beyond this point this is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.720" end="01:09:30.170" style="s2">drone risk this is not being patrolled</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.549" end="01:09:32.029" style="s2">and potentially this could be a haven</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.170" end="01:09:35.150" style="s2">for people so that anybody who was</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.150" end="01:09:40.870" style="s2">will continue to be had somewhere to go</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.029" end="01:09:43.390" style="s2">and lots of parks this is completely</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.870" end="01:09:45.770" style="s2">manageable even without a staff</p>
