<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.880" style="s2">digital campfire where we call hear and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.380" end="00:00:25.450" style="s2">Isiah so you had a question about</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.870" end="00:00:25.450" style="s2">initiation video games of masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.440" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">yeah sorry yeah yeah on the previous</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.410" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">situational assessment that you did you</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:40.440" style="s2">mentioned something about how kids</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:42.570" style="s2">playing Minecraft a lot of untapped</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.440" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">potential to deal with like the issues</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.570" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">in the meadow crisis and I&#39;ve recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">read a lot of them Jungian thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">Robert Wise iron John comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">where they diagnose the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">masculine is lacking initiation rituals</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:03.360" style="s2">from boyhood to manhood so I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:06.509" style="s2">if you have any suggestions on how Gen X</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.360" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">or little men can sort of build that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.509" end="00:01:10.440" style="s2">framework for the young generation I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:13.640" style="s2">guess another way of putting it is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.440" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">can we bring teenagers into the campfire</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.640" end="00:01:20.940" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">big deal and I liked what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.940" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">named it in terms of Gen X and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">Millennials and teenagers right because</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:27.200" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the phases of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:30.009" style="s2">life that are different</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.200" end="00:01:30.009" style="s2">how do you this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.620" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">you&#39;re on mute 31 31 how many kids you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:37.770" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t have kids all right so you and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.770" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">are sort of somewhat the different</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">positions in terms of the this arc of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">life and there&#39;s a couple of folks here</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:46.670" style="s2">look like they&#39;re you know my senior and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">pop a couple folks maybe your junior</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.670" end="00:01:50.760" style="s2">then man oh man it sure is the case that</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.550" style="s2">we dropped the ball on that isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.760" end="00:01:55.740" style="s2">like the degree to which we we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.550" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">just not initiate people into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.740" end="00:01:59.400" style="s2">we sort of did exactly opposite in every</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">possible way so we&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.400" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">catching up to do and I got to really</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">say I have a bad feeling and I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:08.310" style="s2">for that bad feeling but I had a bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:14.040" style="s2">feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">my elders they&#39;re the ones who had an</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.040" end="00:02:18.620" style="s2">opportunity to actually have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">called intergenerational transmission</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.620" end="00:02:22.980" style="s2">but for whatever reason chose to step</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">away from that and did not rebuild it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.980" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">a new way daliyah stood it to my</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:30.660" style="s2">awareness so we&#39;re kind of happy to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:31.769" style="s2">inside we can&#39;t rely on rituals or</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.660" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">traditions they&#39;ve been handed down to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.769" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">us because that if originals traditions</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">were handed down to us or our</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">handed-down had dropped and left behind</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:39.209" style="s2">or so out of place that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:41.489" style="s2">how to use them well then we can recover</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.209" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">stuff from from older environments</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.489" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">there&#39;s actually some pretty good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">out there that other cultures still do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">and use but we should be careful not to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:52.019" style="s2">simulate and I use I often times refer</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:54.269" style="s2">to the folks who we&#39;re way too many</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.019" end="00:02:55.849" style="s2">feathers I mean if you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.269" end="00:02:58.110" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.849" end="00:03:00.420" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna call that a certain simulation</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.110" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">but there are lots of good things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:03.030" style="s2">exist in lots of cultures around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.830" end="00:03:05.220" style="s2">world understand how to do this thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.030" end="00:03:07.560" style="s2">well what I would say is that here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:10.680" style="s2">more or less than nature the beasts each</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">of us as kind of cohorts the boomers the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.680" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">Xers the Millennials and Gen Z have sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">of like a generational crisis that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">to do with something like the the thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">that we have to get over to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">the boomers have to get over and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">just gonna call it narcissism and it has</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">to do with something like I mean can we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">look like a Frank when they were young</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:33.420" style="s2">they were golden children right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">everything whether they as individuals I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.420" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">think everybody&#39;s an individual their</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:38.430" style="s2">life arc is individuals quite diverse</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:40.049" style="s2">but as a generation things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.430" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">worked out they have an embodied sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.049" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">of things kind of working out but</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">neither into life and by the way with</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">this virus that may be closer into life</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">and they maybe thought they were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:50.489" style="s2">be and it&#39;s the ability to turn their</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">attention towards what is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.489" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">legacy of their generation to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:04:00.500" style="s2">that they probably don&#39;t have a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:02.600" style="s2">the terms of let&#39;s call it know-how</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.500" end="00:04:03.890" style="s2">you say their expertise is expertise</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.600" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">associate with an environment that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.890" end="00:04:10.070" style="s2">increasingly in the past but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:11.750" style="s2">whole lot in terms of wisdom now so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.070" end="00:04:13.970" style="s2">not really that interested in most cases</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.750" end="00:04:15.320" style="s2">that in all cases in your institutional</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.970" end="00:04:16.850" style="s2">knowledge I don&#39;t really care that much</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.320" end="00:04:17.900" style="s2">about how the Federal Reserve works</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.850" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to go away real quick</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.900" end="00:04:24.350" style="s2">I care a whole lot about life I care a</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:26.570" style="s2">whole lot about meaning I care a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.350" end="00:04:28.850" style="s2">lot about how what it was actually like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.570" end="00:04:30.440" style="s2">back in the day when communities really</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.850" end="00:04:30.740" style="s2">existed and people really cared for each</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.440" end="00:04:33.620" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.740" end="00:04:35.330" style="s2">what is actually valuable where she</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.620" end="00:04:37.370" style="s2">would be orienting our attention what</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.330" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">really matters my elders</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.370" end="00:04:43.970" style="s2">elder I need the elders to elder so then</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:48.110" style="s2">he got my cohort he&#39;s poor</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.970" end="00:04:50.660" style="s2">slackers of Gen X we got to get over to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.110" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">ourselves and stop being me lists and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.660" end="00:04:53.960" style="s2">just have to actually step in and say</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.250" style="s2">okay some of us have actually built a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.960" end="00:04:57.650" style="s2">capacity to have some level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.250" end="00:04:59.630" style="s2">effectiveness in the moment and most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.650" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">us have skin in the game and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.630" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">have kids do we care about so we have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">embodied relationship with our own</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">bodies have competence and expertise but</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:12.040" style="s2">our biological bodies put us very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:14.300" style="s2">in the this thing needs to happen but in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.040" end="00:05:16.280" style="s2">many ways we also don&#39;t really know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.300" end="00:05:18.380" style="s2">to do we&#39;re behind the curve so we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.280" end="00:05:20.900" style="s2">to support we need to put ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.380" end="00:05:22.310" style="s2">support role to help the Millennials do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:23.660" style="s2">the things that folks in the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.310" end="00:05:25.479" style="s2">day the loads gonna fall in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.660" end="00:05:29.300" style="s2">Millennials to make this thing happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.479" end="00:05:32.900" style="s2">then it just needs to be clear all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.300" end="00:05:34.820" style="s2">so the Millennials responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.900" end="00:05:37.160" style="s2">dr. Jordan Peterson I think showed up as</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:38.780" style="s2">a teleportation from this future for</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.160" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">better or for worse but he shook a whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:42.979" style="s2">lot of people into recognizing that as</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:45.500" style="s2">the Millennial crisis balls in your</p>

<p begin="00:06:07.010" end="00:06:09.410" style="s2">help people make good choices it was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.360" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">kids in the front lines who were</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.410" end="00:06:12.950" style="s2">actually tearing most of the load that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.539" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">kind of where we are now but of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.950" end="00:06:15.860" style="s2">our front lines are spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:16.849" style="s2">frontlines and community frontlines and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.860" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">relearning how to do those things from</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.849" end="00:06:20.960" style="s2">scratch now in some sense you have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.550" style="s2">enormous advantage that our educational</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.960" end="00:06:23.660" style="s2">systems complete shit-shit which to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.550" end="00:06:25.099" style="s2">they didn&#39;t train you very well which</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.660" end="00:06:27.880" style="s2">means you can just kind of throw it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.099" end="00:06:31.430" style="s2">the backdoor and relearn really quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.880" end="00:06:33.169" style="s2">on the other hand the reality is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.430" end="00:06:35.150" style="s2">the Millennials have an incredible level</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.169" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">of capacity like extraordinary level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:38.919" style="s2">capacity both in terms of just sheer</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">smarts and also in terms of like heart</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.919" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">the ball we dropped in certain training</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:44.569" style="s2">masculinity actually built up capacities</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:47.150" style="s2">and young men that we would not have</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.569" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">otherwise had now my generation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.150" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">have a lot of the capacities that your</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:50.659" style="s2">generation has that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:56.690" style="s2">needful right now and things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.659" end="00:07:01.699" style="s2">empathy and self-awareness and EQ just</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.690" end="00:07:03.949" style="s2">talk to a like a real actual boomer man</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.699" end="00:07:07.460" style="s2">and get a sense of how fragile the EQ</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.949" end="00:07:09.289" style="s2">was of that particular generation so</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:11.449" style="s2">take those capacities and then reboot</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.289" end="00:07:13.340" style="s2">that with a new new sensibility of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.449" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">a new masculinity masculinity looks like</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.340" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">and recognize that just imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.030" style="s2">you&#39;re you are going to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:22.490" style="s2">for a family what does that feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.030" end="00:07:23.870" style="s2">what does it mean to prepare a territory</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.490" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">where you actually take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.870" end="00:07:27.349" style="s2">for the area around you what does it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">mean to actually identify in your body</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.349" end="00:07:30.979" style="s2">the feeling of other men who can</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.539" style="s2">actually stand arm and arm your shoulder</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.979" end="00:07:34.789" style="s2">and shoulder and turn themselves towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.539" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">the threat and stand and have it break</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.789" end="00:07:39.949" style="s2">against them right if you can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:41.330" style="s2">energy that&#39;s the energy to get into now</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.949" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the other side we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.330" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">talking a lot about men but this is of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:48.949" style="s2">course fundamentally about female crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.659" style="s2">let&#39;s be very clear the feminine energy</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.949" end="00:07:53.990" style="s2">is that which is being called up in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.659" end="00:07:55.849" style="s2">hardest level across all generations I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.990" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what that looks like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.849" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">just know it&#39;s the case I can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:01.940" style="s2">every time I feel it in my wife for</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.620" style="s2">example and she digs deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.940" end="00:08:07.759" style="s2">and deeper into learning how to discover</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.620" end="00:08:09.590" style="s2">in herself the anchor grounding there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:10.969" style="s2">actually a really good story it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.590" end="00:08:14.160" style="s2">very first chapter of The Grapes of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.969" end="00:08:16.680" style="s2">Wrath anybody read them</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.160" end="00:08:18.030" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s exactly the situation</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.680" end="00:08:19.620" style="s2">alright so it looks like this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.030" end="00:08:23.940" style="s2">maybe even like the first three three</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.620" end="00:08:26.190" style="s2">paragraphs he Steinbeck talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.940" end="00:08:29.250" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the this the Okies the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.190" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">the sharecroppers and the men they go</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.250" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">out and they they put their hands in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:35.010" style="s2">dirt and they sift it they look at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">sky and they look at the crops and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.010" end="00:08:38.789" style="s2">chat with each other and trying to kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:40.500" style="s2">of figure out what&#39;s going on and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.789" end="00:08:41.970" style="s2">women they&#39;re inside in the house right</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.500" end="00:08:43.200" style="s2">there they&#39;re holding the family and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.970" end="00:08:44.370" style="s2">they&#39;re holding the heart and holding</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.200" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">the the grounding and they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.370" end="00:08:48.540" style="s2">and watching but then something happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.310" style="s2">or suddenly you just get this moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.540" end="00:08:54.090" style="s2">where suddenly the woman goes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.310" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">leavin she makes the call that this</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.090" end="00:08:58.470" style="s2">watering hole is no longer valid your</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.300" style="s2">responsibility is now shifted from</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.470" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">trying to make those crops work to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.300" end="00:09:03.090" style="s2">getting this family to somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:05.280" style="s2">somewhere safe all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.090" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">and of course as soon as she says it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.280" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">can see the man just drops what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">doing in pivots I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:13.230" style="s2">been married but by the way that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:14.700" style="s2">it works so that&#39;s kind of it and by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.230" end="00:09:16.200" style="s2">way just learning how to do that at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.700" end="00:09:17.130" style="s2">simple level is a really good practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.200" end="00:09:18.270" style="s2">and a lot of people that happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.130" end="00:09:20.340" style="s2">forced to learn that right now because</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.270" end="00:09:22.920" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer able it&#39;ll really really</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.340" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">distract ourselves with work and school</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.920" end="00:09:26.820" style="s2">and hopefully media and having to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:28.050" style="s2">relearn how to just be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.820" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">with the people we happen to be stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.050" end="00:09:31.770" style="s2">quarantine win but that&#39;s simple stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">of right relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.770" end="00:09:34.200" style="s2">masculine and feminine the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:35.610" style="s2">relationship between men and women which</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.200" end="00:09:37.950" style="s2">aren&#39;t necessarily exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.610" end="00:09:39.090" style="s2">thing is a big part of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.950" end="00:09:40.680" style="s2">this Christ it&#39;s a two degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.090" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">we learn that and relearn that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.680" end="00:09:43.740" style="s2">rebuild capacities by interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:45.420" style="s2">other people and learning what works and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t work and deal with our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.420" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2">fear and fear of limitations in</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.860" end="00:09:50.280" style="s2">ourselves and grow through it as rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:52.890" style="s2">as possible this also begins to talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.280" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">about what Joe is talking about I think</p>
