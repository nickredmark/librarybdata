<p begin="00:01:55.119" end="00:01:58.880" style="s2">gotten the most criticism for</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2">not because people well i&#39;ve gotten two</p>

<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">think in my experience this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">way americans think in their own heart</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">but i also think it&#39;s just gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">completely impractical what do we and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">then what are we gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">so the the wokarati break the united</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">know but that&#39;s before you even get into</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.040" end="00:11:23.839" style="s2">the question of other ethnicities i</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think people have really</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.839" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">quite thought this through i think their</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.440" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">their hatred civic nationalism for</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">certain</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">and so rather than trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">through practical reality on this</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">um they just try to find people who they</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">say adhere to it and therefore those</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">were the bad guys and that&#39;s really why</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">i wrote</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">and i&#39;d rather provoke a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">to write back at me that i was wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">was terrible but it forced them to start</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:01.760" style="s2">then just leave these questions out</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">lying there i have been involved in</p>

<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">for mine is more of like on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.360" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">the stories of people who had the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">transformative experience and then yours</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">is sort of coming at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">historical and a high level view</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.320" style="s2">but one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">consistently struggled with</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.320" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">i&#39;m half irish half ashkenazi my family</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">came here late 19th early 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">i feel 100 american um</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">i hear the magic dirt arguments or</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">counter arguments i hear people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">trashing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">civic nationalism back in 2016 we had</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">more unsavory people in the coalition</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">stressing ethno divisions and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">and and i still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">zeroed down and been able to succinctly</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">what is this american consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">that we</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:15.440" style="s2">idea or is it a heritage or is it a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">history or is it language</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.440" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">and so for me that chapter was really</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.279" style="s2">pertinent and fantastic and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">a key</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">argument in sort of forming this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">anti-globalist</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">can claim garibaldi</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">even though i wasn&#39;t born in italy i</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">teach myself to read italian so that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">could learn machiavelli</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">and i love visiting italy it&#39;s great</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">now if you know my life went sideways in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">some way and i had to flee</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">right but you only there were places you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">could end up um</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">like the tailoring</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:40.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things like the wine</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:41.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things i like about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.639" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">like that that kind of persistent</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">and the other the other point too that i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">would make so again</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:52.320" style="s2">i i feel only loyal to america i feel</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">i guess yes there&#39;s something um</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">irrational about that in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.680" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">but i&#39;d have to say why like</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">just because somebody was born in italy</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">is because you know we saw it happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">in in in in the modern age when</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">there were much more complete records</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">and so on i could ask the same question</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">about so what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">when does an english person become an</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">then the romans come then they</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">intermarry are we are we english yet</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">why does it why are why are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">anglo-saxons called anglo-saxons</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">saxony is in germany it&#39;s because a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">bunch of people from northern europe</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">come over and struggle</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">are they english then you get the norman</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">conquest in 1066.</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">are we have we gotten there yet now from</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">that point on</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">until the mass migrations following</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">world war ii the english population was</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:54.399" style="s2">very very stable</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the same there was no</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.399" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">almost zero net immigration</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">and you know a little bit here and there</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">but very very very stable</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">the but englishness somehow is banged</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">over the course of a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">um without an obvious migratory movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">that you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">from northern europe to the united you</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">know to the north american continent</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">found in the united states and of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">without a signing ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">this is what confuses people so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">think like um</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">well that&#39;s the natural way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.199" style="s2">well if that&#39;s the natural way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">and the only way to do it in this way is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">illegitimate then you&#39;ve sort of bought</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:28.720" style="s2">the left-wing argument that no</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">that there shouldn&#39;t be an american no</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.720" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">one from europe should ever come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">right if if your ethnic status is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">then then both the puritans and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">cavaliers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re just english and they should</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">never have left right and the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.240" style="s2">thing that bothers me that i find</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">inconsistent about this argument is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.240" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">people say no no</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">um the tradition is the only thing we</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">have to get back to tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">all right fair enough i&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">tradition i&#39;m actually pro tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">a lot of ways if it&#39;s a good tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">but then that gets you into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:00.640" style="s2">philosophical question of how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:02.320" style="s2">evaluate tradition you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.640" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">philosophical framework right</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">plato and aristotle would say because</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea of the good and i can</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">evaluate anything in the light of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">just because it&#39;s old doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">good necessarily but all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">or bad or bad yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">um uh well we have to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">okay well the american tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:23.200" style="s2">fighting the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">the american tradition is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.200" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">declaration of independence the american</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">tradition is the constitution and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">northwest ordinance and the bill of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:29.440" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">and all of these things so in the name</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.440" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">of tradition are we supposed to reject</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">our tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.679" style="s2">we&#39;re americans we&#39;re for tradition but</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">my god we really do hate the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.679" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">which gave birth to this country</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">and we really do hate the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">charters of our liberties which are too</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">abstract and enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re supposed to so what</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">tradition are we supposed to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">some medieval tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">i&#39;m very sympathetic to this argument</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">they have not sorted this out and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:53.360" style="s2">sure there&#39;s a lot of people listening</p>
