<p begin="00:00:07.189" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">so the film coming up is a three-way</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.480" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">conversation between me Daniel Thorson</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:16.439" style="s2">of the emerged podcast and Josh fields</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">who&#39;s the CEO of consciousness hacking</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.439" end="00:00:20.610" style="s2">and it&#39;s on the topic of existential</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">risk and collapse which is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.610" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">daniel has been covering a lot on his</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">podcast and josh has also been delving</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">really deeply into it as he&#39;ll outline</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">in the film and it was recorded a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:34.979" style="s2">while ago a couple of months ago during</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:36.839" style="s2">the extinction rebellion protests in</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.979" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">London but it feels like the right time</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.839" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">to release it now and it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:45.960" style="s2">imagine a more important topic but also</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:48.359" style="s2">one that&#39;s really hard to grasp and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.960" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">some ways quite paradoxical which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.359" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">what I try to outline in the first part</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">of the film at the same time that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">we we are talking about collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">there are these kind of very convincing</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:01.229" style="s2">arguments very convincing models it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">still the case that for most people on</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.229" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">the planet this is the best time yet to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">have been alive and in terms of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">in terms of quality of life and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">those things like that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of very conscious about putting</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">a flag in early because I know that our</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">audience quite rightly some of them can</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">be very kind of reactive to that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">whole idea of it because especially the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:26.730" style="s2">sort of the original Peterson audience</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">Jordan Peterson audience because he he</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.730" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">talks a lot about that like that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">not we&#39;re nowhere near grateful enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">for the achievements of Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:36.120" style="s2">civilization and etc etc how do you hold</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:37.830" style="s2">that kind of tension that that is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.120" end="00:01:41.900" style="s2">is probably the deepest paradox of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.830" end="00:01:45.870" style="s2">times right is this M Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.900" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">enlightenment truth that that&#39;s held by</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.870" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">a lot of these thinkers at Peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:52.080" style="s2">Diamandis Steven Pinker that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">an exponential age of progress and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.080" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">Samuel taneous Lee Roy collapsing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:01:59.760" style="s2">simultaneously you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:02.570" style="s2">desecrating ecosystems so life</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.760" end="00:02:05.240" style="s2">expectancy is almost doubled since 1900</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.570" end="00:02:08.310" style="s2">almost the whole world is illiterate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.240" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">child mortality is reduced by 50% since</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">night since since 1990</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:14.670" style="s2">and yet there seems to be coming the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">cost of the very planet we call home and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.670" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">so this is the thing like I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:19.860" style="s2">the left go wrong as they say you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:23.370" style="s2">we&#39;re in this like terrible terrible</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.860" end="00:02:27.930" style="s2">disease like kami apocalyptic times and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.370" end="00:02:30.140" style="s2">it&#39;s all humanity&#39;s fault and what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.930" end="00:02:34.320" style="s2">of that narrative misses is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.140" end="00:02:35.640" style="s2">were also in in the best times that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">something that I struggle really really</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.640" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">struggle to hold and they call that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">environmentalist paradox but both are</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:44.459" style="s2">true gen bando holds a truth Steven</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:48.260" style="s2">Pinker holds a truth one is a claps</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.459" end="00:02:51.480" style="s2">ologist and a catastrophist the other is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.260" end="00:02:52.860" style="s2">precisely and I just think what is being</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.480" end="00:02:56.550" style="s2">called for here is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.860" end="00:03:00.030" style="s2">synthesis that sees these truths as only</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.550" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">half true and that we have to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.030" end="00:03:04.640" style="s2">through into this you know really really</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:07.560" style="s2">celebrating progress while also being</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.640" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">realistic as to the implications of said</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.560" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">progress yeah yeah I resonate a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.740" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">that and I think the danger in any case</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">is from my perspective sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">collapsing into certainty like we know</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">how it&#39;s going to go we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">going to be a kind of catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">collapse or we know that it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">you know exponential beauty for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:36.150" style="s2">of time I think both of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:39.630" style="s2">perspectives seem quite dangerous to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.150" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">if you hold on to it with certainty so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.630" end="00:03:42.989" style="s2">really that&#39;s the kind of rub of it for</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:48.090" style="s2">me and we&#39;ve talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.989" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">Joshua it&#39;s like yeah can we can we hold</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.090" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">both of those perspectives without</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">needing the easy certainty that either</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">could offer if it&#39;s held in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:02.660" style="s2">way and which for this question to both</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">of you which what&#39;s the most convincing</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.660" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">model or evidence or narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen that persuades you that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:10.769" style="s2">collapse narrative is true for people</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">maybe who haven&#39;t been exposed to it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.769" end="00:04:17.010" style="s2">you know delves deeply into it sure you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">guys have so um I I started researching</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.010" end="00:04:21.870" style="s2">for a thesis at at CI is and what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:23.790" style="s2">the parallels between</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.870" end="00:04:26.460" style="s2">predicament and civilizations have gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.790" end="00:04:28.889" style="s2">before and I think there are three</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.460" end="00:04:30.419" style="s2">really and simple mechanisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.889" end="00:04:34.020" style="s2">very self-evident in our current</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.419" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">situation that are also implicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.020" end="00:04:39.000" style="s2">literature as to what some of the causes</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:41.160" style="s2">of collapse have been in the past the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.000" end="00:04:44.190" style="s2">vs. purely environmental degradation</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.160" end="00:04:45.889" style="s2">if you look Jared Diamond and whose is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.190" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">the kind of magnum opus on this but</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.889" end="00:04:50.340" style="s2">societies and civilizations that come</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:52.650" style="s2">out of alignment with their natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.340" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">ecosystems our societies that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.650" end="00:04:55.949" style="s2">destined to fail so we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:58.289" style="s2">environmental degradation as one</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.949" end="00:04:59.729" style="s2">mechanism we have complexity as another</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.289" end="00:05:01.110" style="s2">at this Joseph tinters work I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.729" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">going to go into them but if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.110" end="00:05:05.400" style="s2">our complexity situation just now is</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:07.440" style="s2">exponential complexity linear competence</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.400" end="00:05:08.520" style="s2">the more of these two curves the couple</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.440" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">with the higher the probability we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.520" end="00:05:12.180" style="s2">not going to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:15.449" style="s2">that complexity and then the third is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.180" end="00:05:17.610" style="s2">inequality so if you look at there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.449" end="00:05:20.850" style="s2">various models that show how stable or</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.610" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">unstable society is and and if you enter</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.850" end="00:05:26.130" style="s2">there&#39;s one motor called handi hndy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:30.660" style="s2">really these models are just indicators</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.130" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">of systemic instability and equality</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.660" end="00:05:35.010" style="s2">being a huge variable and where we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:37.349" style="s2">just now with inequality I think M is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.010" end="00:05:40.139" style="s2">pretty easy to see so this combination</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.349" end="00:05:42.870" style="s2">of environmental degradation excess</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.139" end="00:05:45.180" style="s2">complexity and excess inequality are</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.870" end="00:05:47.210" style="s2">three very very clear mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.180" end="00:05:50.729" style="s2">have led to collapse in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.210" end="00:05:54.690" style="s2">they are being expressed in fortitude</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.729" end="00:05:55.710" style="s2">and intent and so with such clarity in</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.690" end="00:06:04.139" style="s2">our current predicament</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.710" end="00:06:10.020" style="s2">I have oscillated between and being an</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.139" end="00:06:12.840" style="s2">inevitable assist and a utopianist to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.020" end="00:06:15.570" style="s2">some degree techo save us or were all</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.840" end="00:06:18.030" style="s2">doomed and to go to your point I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.570" end="00:06:19.490" style="s2">the the quality of consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.030" end="00:06:22.380" style="s2">I&#39;ve attempted to start to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.490" end="00:06:24.199" style="s2">there&#39;s one of uncertainty how do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.380" end="00:06:30.940" style="s2">provide how do we maintain stability</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.199" end="00:06:34.600" style="s2">with another uncertainty yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:36.310" style="s2">I guess I everyone&#39;s proxying their</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.600" end="00:06:38.920" style="s2">sense-making to someone or something at</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.310" end="00:06:40.330" style="s2">some level and in this debate unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.920" end="00:06:43.060" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone deeply into the kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.900" end="00:07:02.020" style="s2">sort of deeply ambivalent relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.980" end="00:07:03.970" style="s2">to extinction rebellion I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.020" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">fantastic that a movement has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.970" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">come from always nowhere and as making</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:11.470" style="s2">environmental collapse such a such a</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.470" end="00:07:17.860" style="s2">at the same time I&#39;m concerned that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:19.600" style="s2">seems to be collapsing a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.860" end="00:07:22.630" style="s2">narrative into a very simple one and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.600" end="00:07:25.300" style="s2">also I&#39;m also concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.630" end="00:07:26.830" style="s2">particular actions that they&#39;re urging</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.300" end="00:07:29.980" style="s2">to be taken and whether they will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.830" end="00:07:33.340" style="s2">effective but but what I&#39;m what I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.980" end="00:07:34.770" style="s2">skeptical of I think is something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:37.000" style="s2">extinction rebellion the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.770" end="00:07:38.890" style="s2">environmental catastrophes room that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.000" end="00:07:41.740" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing at the moment just seems to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.890" end="00:07:47.590" style="s2">map so perfectly on to kind of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.740" end="00:07:50.890" style="s2">religious substructure of Armageddon sin</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.590" end="00:07:53.170" style="s2">repentance all of all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.890" end="00:07:56.440" style="s2">just seem so tight so deeply kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.170" end="00:07:59.200" style="s2">woven into thee yeah the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.440" end="00:08:00.970" style="s2">substructure about thinking that the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.200" end="00:08:04.300" style="s2">fact that it maps on so even even like</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.970" end="00:08:07.630" style="s2">the Greta thumbr kind of child prophet</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.300" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s so and I would have</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.630" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">more I don&#39;t see many people in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:14.950" style="s2">environments saying acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">like I think you have to at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.950" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">acknowledge that before you can say yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:23.110" style="s2">it does seem to map on to all of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:25.150" style="s2">things but at the same time we think</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.110" end="00:08:27.040" style="s2">that the that this is different for some</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.150" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">reason or whatever do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.040" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">concerns about that kind of framework</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.339" end="00:08:38.519" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple of things the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.329" end="00:08:41.789" style="s2">is the first piece is you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.519" end="00:08:43.800" style="s2">skeptical of the reductionism right that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.789" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2">there&#39;s this ko4 and then and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.800" end="00:08:47.009" style="s2">the problem with a lot of the climate</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">movement is that if we just stay below</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.009" end="00:08:52.050" style="s2">the 2 degree mark the the 2 degree mark</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.399" end="00:09:18.449" style="s2">complex system yeah I know you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.380" end="00:09:20.250" style="s2">Jordan Daniel on this this this very</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.050" end="00:09:38.760" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s reductionist materialist</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.760" end="00:09:45.810" style="s2">effectively nonlinear system yeah I mean</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.810" end="00:09:50.339" style="s2">non-linearity are in their in their in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.579" end="00:09:54.149" style="s2">their predictions it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.339" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">simplistic yeah but what&#39;s I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.149" end="00:10:00.089" style="s2">left with a question of like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:04.110" style="s2">alternative for a mass movement is there</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.089" end="00:10:06.600" style="s2">alternative and if not is there no rule</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.110" end="00:10:08.519" style="s2">for this kind of mass uprising in</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.600" end="00:10:10.110" style="s2">consciousness cuz I&#39;d pay yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.519" end="00:10:13.050" style="s2">really see how that would function with</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.110" end="00:10:14.579" style="s2">the kind of complexity lens like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.050" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">problem is everywhere in nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.579" end="00:10:18.689" style="s2">yeah but you catch the problem you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.310" end="00:10:20.730" style="s2">have a mass movement that doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.689" end="00:10:22.709" style="s2">defined like extinction rebellion has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.730" end="00:10:24.420" style="s2">have a defined set of demands you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.709" end="00:10:26.310" style="s2">get people out onto the streets to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.420" end="00:10:28.529" style="s2">protest if you don&#39;t have a defined set</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.310" end="00:10:30.870" style="s2">of up demands well you can but then like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.529" end="00:10:32.579" style="s2">occupy udders in 2008 be dead but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.870" end="00:10:34.019" style="s2">didn&#39;t be had people are in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.579" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">without they just like change the system</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.019" end="00:10:37.199" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve got nowhere because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:39.329" style="s2">they&#39;re wearing any clarified objectives</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.199" end="00:10:40.860" style="s2">yeah well it did expand the Overton</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.329" end="00:10:43.319" style="s2">Window which allowed things like minimum</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.860" end="00:10:44.840" style="s2">wage to go up and people to fight for</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.319" end="00:10:47.240" style="s2">other policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.840" end="00:10:50.450" style="s2">is that you know we&#39;re quite good so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.240" end="00:10:52.130" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s my sense is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.450" end="00:10:54.529" style="s2">easy to demand too much of something</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.130" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">like extinction rebellion hmm right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.529" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">I often you know it&#39;s it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">emember something like you know Rosa</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:04.490" style="s2">Parks refusing to sit down on the bus</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">and the actual civil rights legislation</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.490" end="00:11:10.400" style="s2">were years apart right these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:12.650" style="s2">things move in very nonlinear ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.400" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">consciousness kind of works itself into</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.650" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">reality in complex ways right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:18.890" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:21.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t expect extinction rebellion to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.890" end="00:11:23.300" style="s2">like solve the world but I also see that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.470" end="00:11:27.500" style="s2">it&#39;s pointing us in a direction that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.300" end="00:11:28.700" style="s2">it&#39;s very important and this this piece</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.500" end="00:11:31.790" style="s2">of it the mythological and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.700" end="00:11:33.740" style="s2">architecture and it&#39;s Sauron first of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.790" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">all a pushback and first of all why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.740" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">that problematic okay like just because</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:42.080" style="s2">it is some sort of like there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:43.430" style="s2">of it&#39;s M matching RI archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.080" end="00:11:45.589" style="s2">frameworks and we&#39;re projecting</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.430" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">archetypes onto reality whatever else</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.589" end="00:11:49.910" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:51.380" style="s2">and second of all I think it&#39;s also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.910" end="00:11:52.930" style="s2">points to a deeper truth that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.380" end="00:11:55.640" style="s2">living in deeply methodological times</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.930" end="00:12:00.080" style="s2">like this loss of truth from public</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.640" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">discourse Trump Boris this scaled level</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.080" end="00:12:07.310" style="s2">of deceit this is like there are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:08.690" style="s2">number of texts that have spoken to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.310" end="00:12:11.330" style="s2">importance of truth and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.690" end="00:12:13.550" style="s2">when truth is lost in the myth you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.330" end="00:12:15.980" style="s2">this is Sodom Gomorrah stuff this is you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.550" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">know the loss of the Aryans for</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.980" end="00:12:20.210" style="s2">supposedly because of the loss of truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">and Sir John glob a British historian</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.210" end="00:12:24.440" style="s2">wrote in 1972 that just prior to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:27.110" style="s2">civilizations collapsing they lose</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.440" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">values like truth so I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.110" end="00:12:30.680" style="s2">mythological substructure to our current</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:34.490" style="s2">predicament yeah and I don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.680" end="00:12:35.959" style="s2">know what is anything that&#39;s for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.490" end="00:12:39.260" style="s2">reason I&#39;ll see one of the enter that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.959" end="00:12:42.470" style="s2">though wreck tarnis speaks about and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.260" end="00:12:44.660" style="s2">apocalypse archetype and that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.470" end="00:12:46.730" style="s2">that if we are able to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.660" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">through apocalypse internally in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.730" end="00:12:51.170" style="s2">psyche we don&#39;t actually have to play</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:54.740" style="s2">out an external world and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.170" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">cold yeah this cozy consciousnesses and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.740" end="00:12:59.070" style="s2">this is my big interest is conscious</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:03.209" style="s2">are we able to integrate that Apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.070" end="00:13:06.390" style="s2">archetype internally and if so yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.209" end="00:13:09.029" style="s2">does that play out in the dynamics of of</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.390" end="00:13:11.459" style="s2">the world yeah and before it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.029" end="00:13:12.899" style="s2">happen materially right because in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.459" end="00:13:15.420" style="s2">the work of James Hillman I recently had</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.890" end="00:14:00.600" style="s2">hmm I guess my my point would be if</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.430" end="00:14:04.520" style="s2">you&#39;re asking sort of why does it matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.600" end="00:14:09.930" style="s2">or whether it&#39;s a good thing or not is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.520" end="00:14:12.870" style="s2">that my my concern is that if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:33.350" style="s2">as a sort of similar like like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.029" end="00:14:35.610" style="s2">very prone to these kind of apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.350" end="00:14:38.310" style="s2">movements or thoughts that seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.610" end="00:14:39.959" style="s2">very deeply rooted and are obviously I</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.959" end="00:14:45.029" style="s2">they&#39;re in Christian mythology you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.130" end="00:14:47.070" style="s2">got the whole we don&#39;t know when when</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.350" end="00:14:53.940" style="s2">whole sub sector of that like rapture</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.570" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">mythologies and revelation mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.940" end="00:14:59.700" style="s2">that we and Jamie wheal talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">the talk is gonna be giving in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.700" end="00:15:03.240" style="s2">of weeks time is actually called recap</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:07.589" style="s2">to the rapture from the kind of Silicon</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.240" end="00:15:09.810" style="s2">Valley rapture theologians you might say</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.589" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">and then the Christian theologians that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.810" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">Isis like that there&#39;s a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:16.970" style="s2">kind of thinking around but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.220" end="00:15:19.830" style="s2">know that this one is different from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.970" end="00:15:21.330" style="s2">that this this bit this belief pattern</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.830" end="00:15:27.529" style="s2">seems common to many different groups</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.330" end="00:15:31.529" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s certainly more more</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.529" end="00:15:35.700" style="s2">to be in the climate cult than in one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.510" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">the other cults but there&#39;s very similar</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.700" end="00:15:39.390" style="s2">similar dynamics in a lot of these cut</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:40.980" style="s2">these sort of belief systems completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.390" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s an important piece to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.980" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">point out is that there is a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:51.060" style="s2">crisis and as a as a result of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">meaning crisis what better a an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.060" end="00:15:55.560" style="s2">to to to inject meaning than the end of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:57.660" style="s2">the worlds we can see of humanity and we</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.560" end="00:15:59.490" style="s2">have a hero leading us call grete like</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.660" end="00:16:03.240" style="s2">this is deeply methodological agreed</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:06.390" style="s2">yeah at the same time there is some</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.240" end="00:16:09.720" style="s2">decent science to support this but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.390" end="00:16:12.660" style="s2">at least in my own studies that even the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.720" end="00:16:16.170" style="s2">theory itself even without the empirics</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.660" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">of exponentially extractive technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.170" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">in a limited ecosystem cannot sustain</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:30.180" style="s2">itself in our current model but but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:31.800" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s sir there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.180" end="00:16:35.400" style="s2">very clear there&#39;s a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.800" end="00:16:38.970" style="s2">connection between this desperation for</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.400" end="00:16:41.370" style="s2">meaning and this fitting that jigsaw</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.970" end="00:16:44.280" style="s2">puzzle really well and our collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.370" end="00:16:46.500" style="s2">psyche and is there in it do you have is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.280" end="00:16:48.900" style="s2">there a sense that that&#39;s a problem from</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.500" end="00:16:51.570" style="s2">your perspective as I see that too and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.900" end="00:16:55.800" style="s2">and you know I think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.570" end="00:16:58.530" style="s2">very compelling it&#39;s certainly a part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.800" end="00:17:01.200" style="s2">how I construct my meaning in my life is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.530" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">around this time that we live in that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.200" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">could very well be perhaps is and I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">act as if it&#39;s an age of transition and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:12.500" style="s2">if that doesn&#39;t in amplify the</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:17.010" style="s2">meaningfulness of my human life</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.500" end="00:17:18.089" style="s2">Davis point is though that if that does</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.010" end="00:17:19.380" style="s2">that make it true</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.089" end="00:17:21.659" style="s2">because it&#39;s satisfying some</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.380" end="00:17:25.559" style="s2">meaning-making longing does it make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.659" end="00:17:29.250" style="s2">true yeah I mean this is you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.559" end="00:17:30.630" style="s2">the meaning crisis and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.250" end="00:17:35.100" style="s2">something that&#39;s very very hard to talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.630" end="00:17:36.630" style="s2">about because of because there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.100" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">that was the backlash against the grete</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.630" end="00:17:40.830" style="s2">speech and then there was the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:42.809" style="s2">backlash against that and anyone who was</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.830" end="00:17:44.750" style="s2">sort of seen to criticize or at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.809" end="00:17:47.580" style="s2">question her role was seen as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:48.929" style="s2">could all of these you know angry men</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.580" end="00:17:50.820" style="s2">getting upset by a sixteen year old</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.929" end="00:17:53.669" style="s2">child and this was a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.820" end="00:17:55.710" style="s2">dynamic but it&#39;s very true just even</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.669" end="00:17:56.220" style="s2">looking at her own words and a parent&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.710" end="00:17:58.860" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.220" end="00:18:00.510" style="s2">the solution to Greta&#39;s personal meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:04.470" style="s2">crisis is the crusade that she&#39;s on now</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.510" end="00:18:07.580" style="s2">like they say that she&#39;s she I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.470" end="00:18:12.029" style="s2">you if you look at the the level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.580" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">difficulty and dysfunction in her family</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.029" end="00:18:17.370" style="s2">and her personally because real really</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:23.130" style="s2">help with her and her sister growing up</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.370" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">and they finding this cause has given</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.130" end="00:18:26.850" style="s2">her kind of a real purpose and a real so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">there is something about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.850" end="00:18:32.760" style="s2">crisis playing out in this and also</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:36.090" style="s2">there&#39;s the sense of uneasiness about</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.760" end="00:18:38.010" style="s2">what is personal and what is collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.090" end="00:18:39.419" style="s2">because I I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.010" end="00:18:42.210" style="s2">the book but I&#39;ve read a review of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.419" end="00:18:44.970" style="s2">that the narrative inside the thumb book</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.210" end="00:18:46.980" style="s2">household was if the world was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.970" end="00:18:48.450" style="s2">den Greta would be fine all the children</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.980" end="00:18:50.730" style="s2">were we find that they&#39;re just basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.450" end="00:18:52.950" style="s2">acting out the trauma of the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.730" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">rather than the personal trauma of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.950" end="00:18:56.909" style="s2">family and everything I know about</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:59.909" style="s2">personal growth and psychology says that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.909" end="00:19:03.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case so there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.909" end="00:19:05.580" style="s2">kind of deep concern about what is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.870" end="00:19:07.380" style="s2">with that with activists more generally</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.580" end="00:19:09.620" style="s2">like what is personal trauma being</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.380" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">projected out into the world and what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.620" end="00:19:15.270" style="s2">the world calling for in terms of action</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:17.419" style="s2">and there&#39;s a huge dynamic I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.270" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">there&#39;s and multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.419" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">motivations for lots of different people</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:22.830" style="s2">involved in these movements as well like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.899" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t say that everyone involved</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.830" end="00:19:26.399" style="s2">in extinction rebellion is traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.899" end="00:19:28.970" style="s2">and protected out onto the world but</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.399" end="00:19:32.330" style="s2">there is a there is certainly a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.970" end="00:19:35.450" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.330" end="00:19:37.130" style="s2">important to remember even when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.450" end="00:19:38.990" style="s2">reflect on my time with Occupy Wall</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.130" end="00:19:39.560" style="s2">Street which I organized with in New</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.990" end="00:19:44.690" style="s2">York City</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.560" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s so easy to provide a kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.690" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">of unifying narrative of what that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.330" end="00:19:52.130" style="s2">or what XR is but it too is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:53.630" style="s2">phenomenon like if you go down there it</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.130" end="00:19:55.940" style="s2">is complicated or no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.630" end="00:19:57.530" style="s2">complicated complex right it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.940" end="00:19:59.390" style="s2">self-organizing it&#39;s very immersion</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.530" end="00:20:01.100" style="s2">everybody there has different reasons</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.390" end="00:20:02.930" style="s2">different things that are calling them</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.100" end="00:20:04.940" style="s2">forth even the meaningfulness that they</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.710" end="00:20:21.920" style="s2">seeing what it is that it is happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.980" end="00:20:25.790" style="s2">to me is more interesting than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.920" end="00:20:27.890" style="s2">offer some kind of interpretation of it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.790" end="00:20:29.810" style="s2">right what why is it being called forth</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.890" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">now and I think that speaks into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.810" end="00:20:35.990" style="s2">archetypal piece and I also don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:39.470" style="s2">yeah see it as a problem I mean with</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.990" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">Greta I think that what that speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.470" end="00:20:44.270" style="s2">to me is is anytime that we put somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">else up on a pedestal be it Greta or</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.270" end="00:20:49.850" style="s2">Daniel Sh Malcolm Berger or Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.820" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">which I believe that to be true yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.670" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">also concerned about this kind of</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">before but um in terms of you sing</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.120" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">before Daniel that really stepping into</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.090" end="00:22:45.570" style="s2">the what really trying on claps has felt</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.179" end="00:22:47.429" style="s2">like to me I I went through reading the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.570" end="00:22:49.460" style="s2">literature and going into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.429" end="00:22:53.270" style="s2">of like panic and like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.460" end="00:22:57.539" style="s2">moving into hopelessness and apathy but</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.270" end="00:22:59.429" style="s2">then eventually what happened and as I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.539" end="00:23:02.039" style="s2">then started to digest this process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.429" end="00:23:04.409" style="s2">grief and rather than there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.039" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">nothingness that was kind of embody that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.409" end="00:23:08.669" style="s2">was kind of embody in this hopelessness</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:11.580" style="s2">the other side of grief definitely feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.669" end="00:23:14.789" style="s2">and felt and feels more like a call to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.580" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">action that is clean it&#39;s you know those</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.789" end="00:23:17.880" style="s2">coffees yeah I used coffees you go for</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">with people who you don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.880" end="00:23:21.539" style="s2">go for they kind of like the trivial</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:25.980" style="s2">things do you say yes there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.539" end="00:23:27.960" style="s2">social conformity trying on claps as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.980" end="00:23:30.750" style="s2">archetype and really feeling its</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.960" end="00:23:32.490" style="s2">implications can actually lead to I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.750" end="00:23:35.880" style="s2">think a very healthy and positive</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.490" end="00:23:37.980" style="s2">response it&#39;s not all catastrophizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.880" end="00:23:40.590" style="s2">that may just be a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.980" end="00:23:42.630" style="s2">intermediary step to get to the clean</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.590" end="00:23:43.470" style="s2">face transition by which we want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.630" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">America</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.470" end="00:23:48.360" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s really well said and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:50.010" style="s2">that was what was occurring to me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.360" end="00:23:52.049" style="s2">David as you were speaking is that there</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.010" end="00:23:54.840" style="s2">is a kind of there are different ways to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.049" end="00:23:58.919" style="s2">hold this archetype and I think that or</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.840" end="00:24:00.840" style="s2">this kind of way of seeing and we might</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.919" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2">look it and talk more specifically about</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.840" end="00:24:07.350" style="s2">the difference in maturity that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">different manifestations are holding</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.350" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">this with right and so I noticed too in</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.890" end="00:24:14.010" style="s2">the way that I&#39;ve been related to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:18.690" style="s2">collapse look what I found is that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.010" end="00:24:21.090" style="s2">causes me to reinvest myself into my</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.690" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">community into those around me it offers</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.090" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">a kind of clarifying energy to not spill</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">my energy into the world in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:36.840" style="s2">don&#39;t serve my local context really and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:38.850" style="s2">and you know I can walk through</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.840" end="00:24:40.230" style="s2">extinction rebellion as I&#39;ve been kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.850" end="00:24:42.510" style="s2">of exploring it over the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.230" end="00:24:44.549" style="s2">days and I can see some people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.510" end="00:24:46.890" style="s2">holding this and it&#39;s causing them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.549" end="00:24:48.870" style="s2">panic it&#39;s causing them to freak out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.890" end="00:24:51.929" style="s2">there are others who are holding it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.870" end="00:24:54.120" style="s2">it&#39;s causing them to kind of step into</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.929" end="00:24:56.730" style="s2">themselves go on a kind of hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.120" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">journey to become more heroic through</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.730" end="00:25:00.690" style="s2">extinction rebellion and so it&#39;s serving</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">these both these purposes at once for</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:03.750" style="s2">different people and at least in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">experience the panic was the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:10.830" style="s2">intermediary stage to the century yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.100" end="00:25:12.720" style="s2">yeah I feel I feel that same sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.830" end="00:25:16.110" style="s2">alignment personally in that same sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.720" end="00:25:18.330" style="s2">of kind of need to step up to be equal</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.110" end="00:25:20.040" style="s2">to the times and I felt it from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.330" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">moment that pretty much from the moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">the Trump was elected it was like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:26.549" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t just see quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:30.570" style="s2">how like I&#39;m a foreign affairs</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.570" end="00:25:36.059" style="s2">I could just see okay all of these all</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.710" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">the things that were put in place after</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.059" end="00:25:43.370" style="s2">the Second World War to kind of keep to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">keep the peace from the UN to NATO to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.370" end="00:25:49.230" style="s2">yeah what to all all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:52.610" style="s2">international organizations Trump was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">going to demolish all was going to to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.610" end="00:25:56.580" style="s2">so individualist that we were back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:25:58.649" style="s2">the age of sort of great</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.580" end="00:26:00.659" style="s2">our politics in a multipolar world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.649" end="00:26:02.820" style="s2">that that was so that was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.659" end="00:26:04.649" style="s2">maybe an information of collapse like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.820" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">think we&#39;re still we still have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.649" end="00:26:08.070" style="s2">see it play out but I look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:11.190" style="s2">these different vectors from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.070" end="00:26:13.350" style="s2">politics to the environment or to all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.190" end="00:26:15.929" style="s2">these different things I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.350" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">the narrative this is my other I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.929" end="00:26:19.559" style="s2">want to just kind of feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:22.950" style="s2">focusing solely on extinct and rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.559" end="00:26:25.649" style="s2">here but in this instant instance of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.950" end="00:26:28.679" style="s2">what I feel is the collapse is so multi</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.649" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">very even so pervasive and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.679" end="00:26:31.649" style="s2">interesting that extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:33.210" style="s2">has happened in the UK where I think our</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.649" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">political system is going through this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.210" end="00:26:39.809" style="s2">sort of death experience like a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:42.090" style="s2">national breakdown in many ways is like</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.090" end="00:26:47.850" style="s2">collapse through so many different areas</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.380" end="00:27:05.580" style="s2">out at the same time so that&#39;s my other</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.179" end="00:27:07.590" style="s2">concern with something like extinction</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.580" end="00:27:09.779" style="s2">rebelling or something like an activist</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:31.380" style="s2">at the same time is is something I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.149" end="00:27:32.220" style="s2">that&#39;s really something I&#39;m drawn to and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.380" end="00:27:34.740" style="s2">that that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.220" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">at that exact point is Mike pushback to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.740" end="00:27:39.330" style="s2">people who are acclaimed skeptics is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:40.860" style="s2">that they see the planetary boundary</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.539" end="00:27:46.440" style="s2">not even real yeah the planetary</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:48.299" style="s2">boundary framework and from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.440" end="00:27:51.929" style="s2">Stockholm resilience Center identifies</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.299" end="00:27:53.549" style="s2">nine planetary boundaries and if one if</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.019" end="00:28:02.760" style="s2">humanity climate change is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.360" end="00:28:05.059" style="s2">boundaries right we&#39;ve already passed</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.760" end="00:28:06.909" style="s2">four of them others you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.059" end="00:28:12.049" style="s2">others are like you know biodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.909" end="00:28:13.789" style="s2">and so if you look at you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.049" end="00:28:16.929" style="s2">have to be looking at climate change to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.789" end="00:28:19.399" style="s2">know that things are fundamentally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.929" end="00:28:22.129" style="s2">the complexity of our institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.399" end="00:28:24.830" style="s2">are our inability to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.129" end="00:28:27.019" style="s2">decisions and our political systems like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.830" end="00:28:29.149" style="s2">these are all symptoms of much much</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.019" end="00:28:31.940" style="s2">deeper structural issues yeah and also</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.149" end="00:28:33.049" style="s2">for example the biodiversity one&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.940" end="00:28:35.269" style="s2">really interesting one because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.049" end="00:28:39.799" style="s2">looking at the effect of pesticides</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.269" end="00:28:41.480" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the effect of I look</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.799" end="00:28:43.899" style="s2">at like the mental health crisis another</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.480" end="00:28:47.179" style="s2">one it&#39;s like the the materialist</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.899" end="00:28:49.490" style="s2">paradigm that does not appreciate living</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.179" end="00:28:53.740" style="s2">systems at all and has been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.490" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">imposing this very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.740" end="00:28:58.940" style="s2">mechanistic narratives on so many areas</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:00.679" style="s2">of our planet as is is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.940" end="00:29:02.269" style="s2">closest to sort of that the root cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.679" end="00:29:06.289" style="s2">of a lot of things we&#39;re seeing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.269" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">like the medical one is like the mental</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.289" end="00:29:09.889" style="s2">health the catastrophe of mental health</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.940" end="00:29:14.419" style="s2">and in the West it&#39;s just astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.889" end="00:29:16.879" style="s2">addiction levels and this is also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.419" end="00:29:20.330" style="s2">interlinked so the mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.879" end="00:29:22.549" style="s2">for me it&#39;s the crisis of trauma to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.330" end="00:29:24.710" style="s2">large degree and people are feeling</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.549" end="00:29:27.559" style="s2">depressed and anxious because their</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.710" end="00:29:32.149" style="s2">nervous systems are unable to handle the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.559" end="00:29:34.610" style="s2">the intensities of modern life and most</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.149" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">of our coping mechanisms are to go numb</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.610" end="00:29:39.139" style="s2">to the pain is too much to handle too</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.980" end="00:29:41.929" style="s2">much to hold and I think part of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.139" end="00:29:43.820" style="s2">numbness part of the the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.929" end="00:29:46.279" style="s2">our numbness is that we are dead to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.820" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">living systems by which we partake we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.279" end="00:29:49.610" style="s2">are dead to the damage we&#39;re doing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:52.460" style="s2">the environment we&#39;re dead to the damage</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.610" end="00:29:55.399" style="s2">we&#39;re doing to each other and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.460" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s also this there&#39;s a loss sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.399" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">I just like to look around in like this</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:02.360" style="s2">sometimes I just feel like this lack of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:07.759" style="s2">vitality mmm it&#39;s like life force life</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.360" end="00:30:09.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t navigating its way or through us</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.759" end="00:30:12.679" style="s2">as living systems or through our living</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.950" end="00:30:15.500" style="s2">systems as a whole in a way that it that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.679" end="00:30:17.820" style="s2">that it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.500" end="00:30:19.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a deadening and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.820" end="00:30:21.809" style="s2">really what&#39;s being cold for it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.140" end="00:30:23.610" style="s2">this transitions into a transition of</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.809" end="00:30:28.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t see many of beasts animals</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.610" end="00:30:30.780" style="s2">unless they&#39;ve been right pretty abused</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.430" end="00:30:33.630" style="s2">investigates and abused like that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.780" end="00:30:35.160" style="s2">natural world is self itself or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.630" end="00:30:38.370" style="s2">depressed animals I mean it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.160" end="00:30:39.870" style="s2">human yeah yeah well there&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.370" end="00:30:41.220" style="s2">think what you&#39;re putting to Joshua is</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.870" end="00:30:44.070" style="s2">that there are other ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.220" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">right that we&#39;ve also lost access to I</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.070" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">think this is what you&#39;re saying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:50.820" style="s2">been a kind of like mono culturing of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:52.230" style="s2">our epistemologies that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.820" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">but you have to have a conversation like</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.230" end="00:30:56.940" style="s2">is it true that collapse is happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">can I really believe it but like after I</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.940" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">said a retreat and then I walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:02.309" style="s2">cities like the streets of New York City</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:04.429" style="s2">which I&#39;ve done before I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.309" end="00:31:07.770" style="s2">recommend it it&#39;s very overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.429" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">you can if you listen to yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.770" end="00:31:12.900" style="s2">different way you could be like this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:15.050" style="s2">there&#39;s something not right here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.900" end="00:31:19.740" style="s2">something that&#39;s not working here like</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.050" end="00:31:21.870" style="s2">and that can give that offers me a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:24.750" style="s2">different way in to understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.870" end="00:31:26.670" style="s2">dynamics that are at play right now and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.750" end="00:31:31.230" style="s2">that we don&#39;t trust that but we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.670" end="00:31:33.000" style="s2">oh no that&#39;s just a feeling this this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.230" end="00:31:34.740" style="s2">the this is I think again this the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.000" end="00:31:36.120" style="s2">paradigm shift that has to come when</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.740" end="00:31:38.490" style="s2">people speak about the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:41.250" style="s2">feminine hippie language what it quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.490" end="00:31:44.250" style="s2">simply is is the M the the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.250" end="00:31:47.460" style="s2">that rational abstraction is only a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.250" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">single way of knowing and the really the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.460" end="00:31:52.830" style="s2">parts of our bodies that know mmm that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:56.670" style="s2">our studio with our survival aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.830" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">abstract it&#39;s it&#39;s a very deep somatic</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.670" end="00:32:00.690" style="s2">way of being and I think what modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:05.910" style="s2">culture has done it&#39;s either condemned</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.690" end="00:32:08.910" style="s2">them it&#39;s like girly weak or just not as</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.910" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">accurate a sense making mechanism and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.910" end="00:32:12.120" style="s2">so doing has actually shut us off</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.590" end="00:32:16.630" style="s2">because ultimately this is the thing if</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.120" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">we knew what we were doing we would stop</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:20.770" style="s2">but in order to know you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:25.960" style="s2">think it has to be felt</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.770" end="00:32:30.220" style="s2">and I think and I feel that this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.960" end="00:32:32.170" style="s2">where a lot of the action isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.220" end="00:32:33.730" style="s2">taking place it&#39;s because we&#39;re still at</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.970" end="00:36:56.550" style="s2">rationality lastly we have to synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.220" end="00:36:59.730" style="s2">it with these deeply embodied ways of</p>

<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:08.790" style="s2">then you hybridize that with artificial</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.130" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">intelligence this is a new thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.790" end="00:37:20.280" style="s2">emerging and I&#39;m starting to trust in</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.280" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">that just because whatever is going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.090" end="00:37:30.270" style="s2">emerge is going to only emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:32.460" style="s2">being able to tap into that still place</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.270" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">like collectively and individually where</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.460" end="00:37:36.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to emerge from panic takes us</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:40.500" style="s2">completely out of the the place of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.600" end="00:37:43.859" style="s2">contact with that emergent space so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.500" end="00:37:44.970" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not gonna be the thing like if</p>

<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:51.330" style="s2">not gonna we&#39;re not gonna make it from</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.350" end="00:37:53.010" style="s2">there that&#39;s almost like that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.330" end="00:37:55.800" style="s2">it a self-fulfilling prophecy the kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.010" end="00:37:57.420" style="s2">of the determination narrative yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:38:00.780" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting I mean from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.420" end="00:38:03.450" style="s2">meditative perspective Trust is the key</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.080" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">stability in our own being I think when</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.109" end="00:38:43.330" style="s2">stuff does start to break down people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:46.089" style="s2">are going to be searching for whether</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.089" end="00:38:53.020" style="s2">going on and where do we go and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.160" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">to cultivate and being a pillar of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.020" end="00:38:58.570" style="s2">stability amidst the chaos is possibly</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:01.720" style="s2">our greatest service to the world yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.570" end="00:39:04.330" style="s2">think in terms of going local you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.720" end="00:39:06.130" style="s2">mentioned the word localism I think in</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.330" end="00:39:07.720" style="s2">terms of our offering to our community</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:09.609" style="s2">and this is a piece that I really want</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.720" end="00:39:11.619" style="s2">to emphasize because of the impact is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.609" end="00:39:14.070" style="s2">out of my own life and because of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.619" end="00:39:18.310" style="s2">what I&#39;ve read in the literature is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.070" end="00:39:21.790" style="s2">necessity of introducing a truth and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.310" end="00:39:24.250" style="s2">transparency into relationships that can</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.790" end="00:39:26.109" style="s2">we as were pillars of stability also</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.250" end="00:39:28.060" style="s2">start to encourage truthful and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.109" end="00:39:30.339" style="s2">transparent communication as much as</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.060" end="00:39:33.099" style="s2">possible because I think one of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.339" end="00:39:35.619" style="s2">and existential risk factors of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.099" end="00:39:37.720" style="s2">times is actually this loss of truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.619" end="00:39:40.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s a loss of sense making as</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.720" end="00:39:42.250" style="s2">organisms if you can if you cannot sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.030" end="00:39:43.510" style="s2">make in your environment and think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.250" end="00:39:46.089" style="s2">it we&#39;re transitioning more from</p>

<p begin="00:39:57.099" end="00:40:05.320" style="s2">regard to social media but can we create</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:07.390" style="s2">containers of trust through truth so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.320" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">that when stuff starts to happen we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.390" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">our boys and girls and we can trust for</p>
