<p begin="00:05:16.930" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">part of the problem I apologize it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.110" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">hard to want to hang out and go create</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.610" end="00:05:49.339" style="s2">they&#39;re all gonna make sense to go</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.539" end="00:05:51.699" style="s2">through each individual one but we came</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.339" end="00:05:51.699" style="s2">up with</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.539" end="00:18:38.030" style="s2">have 500 people having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.380" end="00:18:39.830" style="s2">every week because you can have a</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.830" end="00:18:45.650" style="s2">these conversations and then have people</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:49.150" style="s2">if they think they came up with a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.650" end="00:18:56.659" style="s2">idea at the table have somebody who can</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.150" end="00:18:59.390" style="s2">learn just like present it to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.659" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">else but that&#39;s not the word like bring</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:13.100" style="s2">be created and doing that times five so</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.549" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">that would be 125 ideas that are created</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.100" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">and having the best one</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:30.990" style="s2">shuffle but anything we come up with is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.710" end="00:19:32.460" style="s2">going to be amazing parents what we</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.780" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">other work on creating solution raisings</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.080" end="00:22:00.010" style="s2">itself the process of how do we because</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:02.380" style="s2">all of these solutions are something we</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.010" end="00:22:03.700" style="s2">could potentially do with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.380" end="00:22:05.800" style="s2">and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.700" end="00:22:07.510" style="s2">so then part of solution or a theme is</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.800" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2">going to be how can we actually get</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.510" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 so we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.360" end="00:22:16.300" style="s2">create one of these projects just keep</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:18.310" style="s2">creating them and keep improving the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.300" end="00:22:23.470" style="s2">ones we do create and learning from that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.310" end="00:22:25.090" style="s2">process and learning from that process</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.470" end="00:22:27.870" style="s2">learning what we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.090" end="00:22:27.870" style="s2">facilitate that process</p>

<p begin="00:22:51.519" end="00:22:57.169" style="s2">to do this so until we figure that all</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.230" end="00:22:58.220" style="s2">out the point isn&#39;t to make a profit</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.169" end="00:22:59.419" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what&#39;s wrong with the</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:13.369" style="s2">something not so that they earn money so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.850" end="00:23:18.009" style="s2">we can all be rich we design a food</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.369" end="00:23:18.009" style="s2">system that gets us fed in a nutritious</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.770" end="00:23:25.909" style="s2">and if that helps us actually track</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.870" end="00:23:28.789" style="s2">things and trust things and work</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.909" end="00:23:31.660" style="s2">together to facilitate the process of</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:37.030" style="s2">Oh distancing we work together to create</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.810" end="00:23:39.970" style="s2">community infrastructure I&#39;d be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.030" end="00:23:43.180" style="s2">find teams and run teams and I mean team</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.970" end="00:23:45.160" style="s2">very loosely a bands a creative group</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.180" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">like I got closely computer like this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.160" end="00:23:54.460" style="s2">gonna help this is gonna help with the</p>
