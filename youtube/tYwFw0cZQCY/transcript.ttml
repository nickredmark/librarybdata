<p begin="00:02:22.350" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">won&#39;t explain add up some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:28.320" style="s2">principles but we&#39;re just going to begin</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">the review of what we did last time so</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.320" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">the first is embracing the tree and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.910" style="s2">remember we want to always first before</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">we even begin we wanted to Luigi which</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.910" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">is that basic standing posture I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">to turn the sign on again to help you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">okay so my feet are about shoulder width</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">apart and I make sure my totally toes</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">are pointing forward if my toes are out</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:52.380" style="s2">like this it means I&#39;m actually locking</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">my knees of my hips right and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.380" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">that would massively reduces my</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:02:58.740" style="s2">sensitivity and my flexibility so what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">want to do is I want to shoot make sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.740" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">my toes both shoulder width apart</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">my feet shoulder width apart they should</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">say my toes going forward I put my hands</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:10.650" style="s2">out and notice how you might be tempted</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:12.510" style="s2">to do this all right see how my elbows</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.650" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">are rolled up let them roll down as if</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">there&#39;s weights pulling your elbows down</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">I open my hands then I start to sit as</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:23.010" style="s2">I&#39;m going to sit on a stool I bend my</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:25.500" style="s2">knees and I tuck my coccyx in and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.010" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">make sure my shoulders are open and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.500" end="00:03:31.770" style="s2">let my hands fall back and I have my</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">aides under my armpits here okay and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.770" end="00:03:36.239" style="s2">put a little tiny bend in my head a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">little tiny bent it straighten out my</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:43.050" style="s2">spine okay so that&#39;s one G and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.030" style="s2">important to practice standing that way</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.050" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">I won&#39;t stand there for very long</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.030" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">because you have limited time but</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:52.320" style="s2">standing this this is part of Jen jump</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">John John is the part of economy which</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.320" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">we are standing and what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">we&#39;re cultivating very comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">and dynamically integrated mind body</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:04.140" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:05.989" style="s2">okay now or in would you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.140" end="00:04:10.010" style="s2">going to do is we&#39;re going to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.989" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">embracing the tree I bring my hands up</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.010" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">but like a hand width apart notice that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">my elbows again are not up they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">rolled down my elbows are below my</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:22.830" style="s2">wrists my wrists are below my shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like I&#39;m squeezing a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.830" end="00:04:26.790" style="s2">ball spongy ball this way and also this</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.820" style="s2">a so you have to give it like when</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.560" end="00:35:18.290" style="s2">things are sort of feeling really good</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.820" end="00:35:22.700" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing is building up this</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:52.520" style="s2">mindfulness then that indicates that</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a change beginning in the</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">used to be all like this in a single</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:05.740" style="s2">suddenly see how complex and varied it</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.910" end="00:36:09.530" style="s2">is but that is ultimately a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.740" end="00:36:12.010" style="s2">the deed Allah Allah he I hope I did not</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.530" end="00:36:15.640" style="s2">mispronounce that forgive me if I did</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.010" end="00:36:17.150" style="s2">one thing that I don&#39;t talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.640" end="00:36:20.869" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.150" end="00:36:25.660" style="s2">largely ignorant I have read and I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.869" end="00:36:28.700" style="s2">spoken to Muslim communities I have two</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.660" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">had two wonderful discussions the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.700" end="00:36:35.839" style="s2">recent with Hudson surah on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.220" end="00:36:38.510" style="s2">interrelationship between my work and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.839" end="00:36:40.369" style="s2">these practices and Islam and I handle</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.510" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">both of those conversations as special</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.369" end="00:36:47.589" style="s2">it was very mutually beneficial but I</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:50.630" style="s2">hesitate to speak any way of Islam</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.589" end="00:36:52.690" style="s2">e-even the Sufi tradition within it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.630" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">fine because although it&#39;s closer</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.690" end="00:36:57.319" style="s2">participated in practices and studied a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.430" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">little bit more my connect my</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.319" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">understanding of Islam is very very</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">superficial and so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.450" end="00:37:12.440" style="s2">acknowledge that are not ignoring Islam</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:17.329" style="s2">I am actually acting out of respect</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.440" end="00:37:19.160" style="s2">proper respect for it so I read in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.329" end="00:37:20.809" style="s2">books about Taoism chicon that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.160" end="00:37:22.339" style="s2">inadvisable to attempt these exercise</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.809" end="00:37:24.260" style="s2">without transmission from a living</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.799" end="00:37:38.660" style="s2">so I don&#39;t promote myself that way</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.549" end="00:37:40.099" style="s2">because there&#39;s temptation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.660" end="00:37:44.359" style="s2">temptation to inflation there&#39;s</p>
