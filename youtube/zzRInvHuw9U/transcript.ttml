<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">by daniel Mettenberger i loved this this</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.700" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">podcast that i listened to a walking</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:21.660" style="s2">talks all about sense making and how the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:24.840" style="s2">difference in truth and and truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.660" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">and all the link language that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.840" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">gonna do right because language is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:33.059" style="s2">my strong strong point that it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">the biggest challenges for my brain but</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.059" end="00:00:37.140" style="s2">this is the idea that I&#39;ve tackled and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">this is what the the technological</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.140" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">cooperative helps us tackle because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have things make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">what we need to do is develop a way for</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">people who want the sense making who</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">want to understand the complex problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">and be able to talk to other people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">understand the complex problems to</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">understand the complexity and just like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:01.500" style="s2">you talks about in there and I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">about one human brain can&#39;t retain all</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.500" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">of the knowledge and yet it is all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">somewhat contained on online but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">not accessible it&#39;s not what do we trust</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.600" style="s2">and if it&#39;s not if we we can&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">from it directly and even if we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.600" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">even if we had a genius brain where</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">they&#39;re not conversing with people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">understand that knowledge so we need a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">way to have trust for the information</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">which involves having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">before even ever tackling whether this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:30.229" style="s2">thing is trustworthy we have to remove</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:33.780" style="s2">our bias by having the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.229" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">beforehand before we have a debate on</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.780" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">whether the scientific paper follows our</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">worldview or not we need to have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">discussion of like what algorithm would</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">grade this science so that we can know</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">how trustworthy the science is was it</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">repeatable how many people were in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">study what were the rigorous and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">rigorous um like have an actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">discussion about every scientific paper</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">everyone&#39;s not going to have that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.549" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">conversation but people who want to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">that conversation making it accessible</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">to them as possible having layers of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">information so data the raw data</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">available as much as we can to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">then no one&#39;s gonna actually look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:10.300" style="s2">that very few people are gonna look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.300" end="00:02:14.830" style="s2">you could look at it then having a layer</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:16.600" style="s2">on top of it of the peer review and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.830" end="00:02:18.520" style="s2">actual journal like the articles that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.600" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">are written on that information having</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.520" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">people all the way up to and he does not</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:26.530" style="s2">agree with us having it understandable</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">by the masses having it explainable to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.530" end="00:02:29.800" style="s2">an eighth grade or having explainable to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:31.450" style="s2">a fourth grader how many explainable to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.800" end="00:02:33.130" style="s2">a five-year-old because if we want</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.450" end="00:02:34.690" style="s2">people to understand blockchain if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.130" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">want people to understand climate change</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.690" end="00:02:39.940" style="s2">we look at the whole picture of it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:42.190" style="s2">the people who can make the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.940" end="00:02:44.830" style="s2">deep conversation or having that but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.190" end="00:02:46.990" style="s2">also needed it at a level that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.830" end="00:02:49.150" style="s2">understandable and people to play with</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.990" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">the data together we need to develop the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.150" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">system where we trust it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">matter it doesn&#39;t need 7.5 billion</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:56.800" style="s2">people to trust it doesn&#39;t even need our</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:58.330" style="s2">politicians and our corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.800" end="00:03:00.730" style="s2">trust it because they&#39;re not going to as</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.330" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">he talks about for the entire podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.730" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">which is an hour in 50 minutes long</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.710" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re all ready in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:11.890" style="s2">profit they&#39;re already biased against</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:13.210" style="s2">craving that we can&#39;t trust our</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.890" end="00:03:14.650" style="s2">governments they used to be we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.210" end="00:03:18.390" style="s2">trust our government websites and now we</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.650" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">no longer can we can create we can have</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.390" end="00:03:22.390" style="s2">once they open source that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:23.890" style="s2">like to libraries but he talks about a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.390" end="00:03:25.630" style="s2">Geiger counter and everyone has a Geiger</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.890" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">counter and everyone has a microscope</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.630" end="00:03:29.890" style="s2">and everyone has these tools to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.220" end="00:03:32.170" style="s2">to to publish data we can make that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.890" end="00:03:34.840" style="s2">accessible we can make it accessible</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.170" end="00:03:36.550" style="s2">when we create the co-operative that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.840" end="00:03:38.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the truth piece of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">cooperative is tackling this issue</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.110" end="00:03:42.550" style="s2">having the conversation on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:44.350" style="s2">trust science what do we trust in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.550" end="00:03:46.180" style="s2">economics and it&#39;s not about perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.350" end="00:03:48.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not about having it be perfect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.180" end="00:03:51.490" style="s2">about getting the best of and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.520" end="00:03:55.150" style="s2">continually improving it there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.490" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">to have sense making we have to do it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.150" end="00:03:58.090" style="s2">together because if a tiny group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:03:59.740" style="s2">people get together behind closed doors</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.090" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">and make sense of it they then have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.740" end="00:04:05.740" style="s2">sell it back to us if everyone can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:08.320" style="s2">involved as deeply as they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.740" end="00:04:09.880" style="s2">and can be involved and if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.320" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">understand a subject it is made</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.880" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">available to you in your learning style</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">that is how we make sense of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">interlocking problems the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:21.100" style="s2">make sense of it and then to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:21.850" style="s2">be open to what is going wrong with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.100" end="00:04:24.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.850" end="00:04:27.670" style="s2">what data do we need our own personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.670" end="00:04:29.920" style="s2">data that again you have to be we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.670" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">to let people retain control of even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.920" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">it makes for less rigorous science</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:36.730" style="s2">because the only way people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.350" style="s2">feel comfortable giving their data for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.730" end="00:04:41.230" style="s2">the greater good is if they retain</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.350" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">control of it so I just wanted to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.230" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">on and say a little bit about that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:49.450" style="s2">I know how we create sense making with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:51.100" style="s2">the global technical global tech</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.450" end="00:04:53.350" style="s2">cooperative this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.100" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">people to be tackling is how do we in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.350" end="00:04:58.720" style="s2">every different area how do we know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.640" style="s2">is true not perfectly true because there</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.720" end="00:05:02.590" style="s2">generally isn&#39;t there&#39;s always gray area</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.640" end="00:05:04.420" style="s2">but how do we tackle climate change</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">what&#39;s every question we would want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.420" end="00:05:09.160" style="s2">know about vaccines and which ones have</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">actually been answered instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.160" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">looking at what was published</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:14.290" style="s2">brainstorming before you ever get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:16.120" style="s2">which side you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.290" end="00:05:17.770" style="s2">what would what we want to know in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.120" end="00:05:20.350" style="s2">perfect world and what&#39;s hatch then</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.770" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">studied and what can be studied that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.350" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been studied and what has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">studied where does it fall and who</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:30.010" style="s2">funded those studies we can make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.980" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">metadata ourselves we can organize the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.010" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">metadata we can make the information</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:35.560" style="s2">usable and understandable so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:39.580" style="s2">move forward on creating actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.560" end="00:05:41.620" style="s2">solutions and so that&#39;s just what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:43.300" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t respond to this because I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.620" end="00:05:44.620" style="s2">have some solutions just kind of cause</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:46.510" style="s2">guess what he says like you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.620" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">think you have solutions I do I know I</p>
