<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">podcast livestream I believe this is our</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.510" end="00:00:22.380" style="s2">22nd livestream that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">I&#39;m here with dr. Heather highing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.380" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">Wow is there a lot going on in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">we are gonna rise we are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:32.940" style="s2">to talk about this and do some some</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:35.280" style="s2">analysis I thought that actually though</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.940" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">in light of how much there is it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.280" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">on and the fast pace of change I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">it might be wise just as a counterpoint</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">to open with something that is important</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">but maybe isn&#39;t so much of the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:50.039" style="s2">I had an important question for you how</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.039" end="00:00:54.750" style="s2">dream doesn&#39;t count this this is your</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.309" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">important question for me I mean you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.750" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">agree it&#39;s important it&#39;s not oh well</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure it is but you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">sense do you think it counts or do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">think actually it&#39;s a freebie it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.970" style="s2">a freebie I just don&#39;t even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">respond to you here okay this is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.970" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">freebie is I&#39;m less sure but anyway take</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">that as it is were you eating cake in</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">your dreams last night you know it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:20.580" style="s2">happens every so often and I must say</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">it&#39;s never great but sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.580" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">better than you&#39;d expect having what</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">like listen to Marie Antoinette like</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll just go ahead and do it all</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">right you know it&#39;s always hard to tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:31.159" style="s2">in dreams what what actually took place</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">because you forget it on waking up but</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.159" end="00:01:37.079" style="s2">yeah well all right so that&#39;s it for not</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">so timely but important matters you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.079" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">wanted to lead us into this landscape so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">people who maybe aren&#39;t aware of where</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve landed can be brought up to speed</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">before we do any analysis yeah first off</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.450" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">we want to show the clip from Mike</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">Nina&#39;s excellent three-part documentary</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">on what happened at Evergreen that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">tried to show last time but which really</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">does indicate how much what we saw on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">college campus three four or five years</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">ago has spilled out into the streets</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:07.539" style="s2">right now so Zach if you would show the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">clip from</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.539" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">the hunted individual I have to say I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:15.430" style="s2">keep being invited to talk about free</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">speech on college campuses and every</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.430" end="00:02:19.000" style="s2">time I&#39;m invited I make the same point</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:21.519" style="s2">which is this isn&#39;t about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">and this is only tangentially about</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.519" end="00:02:26.980" style="s2">college campuses this is about a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:28.810" style="s2">breakdown in the basic logic of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.980" end="00:02:30.940" style="s2">civilization and it&#39;s spreading and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.810" end="00:02:34.569" style="s2">college campuses may be the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.940" end="00:02:36.849" style="s2">dramatic battle but of course this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.569" end="00:02:39.190" style="s2">going to find its way into the courts</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.849" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">it&#39;s already found its way into the tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.190" end="00:02:43.750" style="s2">sector it&#39;s going to find its way to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:46.060" style="s2">highest levels of governance if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.750" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">not careful and it actually does</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.060" end="00:02:56.440" style="s2">jeopardize the ability of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">to continue to function alright so in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.440" end="00:02:59.829" style="s2">light of that in light of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:03.880" style="s2">predictions that you made a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.829" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">years ago what&#39;s happening today one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.880" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">the things that is happening today June</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:12.329" style="s2">10 2020 is a movement accompanied by</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">many hashtags to hashtag shutdown stem</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.329" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">hashtag shutdown academia stem being of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">course the acronym for science</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:24.010" style="s2">technology engineering and math and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">thought what we do first is show a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.010" end="00:03:28.359" style="s2">couple more clips from the very first</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:31.569" style="s2">day of the public parts of the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.359" end="00:03:34.299" style="s2">protests and then show a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.569" end="00:03:38.579" style="s2">about what the shutdown stem movement is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.299" end="00:03:41.170" style="s2">looking like today three years later in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.579" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">on college campuses may I put a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.170" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">placeholder before we go there that clip</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.910" style="s2">is from Mike and you just a chat a clip</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:53.319" style="s2">that we just showed is from Mike Maness</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.910" end="00:03:56.470" style="s2">documentary and it was at Peter big</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.319" end="00:03:59.440" style="s2">oceans table with Helen pluck Rose you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.470" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">James Lindsay all present and mighty</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.440" end="00:04:05.700" style="s2">Nina they&#39;re filming and my point is one</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">of the things that will come up today is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.700" end="00:04:12.069" style="s2">how much this was apparent in its early</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:13.359" style="s2">phases to some of us and we were told</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.069" end="00:04:16.450" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t for real or wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.359" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">important but you mustn&#39;t get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.450" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">that this was invisible because their</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:21.010" style="s2">whole reason we were sitting around that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">table was that some of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:26.410" style="s2">were very concerned and yeah I think I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:29.410" style="s2">did nail it in that clip but so did they</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:31.330" style="s2">and so so did many of us and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.410" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">were being told for years you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.330" end="00:04:35.050" style="s2">really before Evergreen blew up we were</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.310" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">we were talking about this with people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.050" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">we were being told that this was a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:42.820" style="s2">niche faculty in the humanities and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">had no bearing on the outside world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.820" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">there was no way that this ideology</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:51.160" style="s2">would have the the legs to get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.380" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">and here we have people falling all over</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.160" end="00:04:57.550" style="s2">themselves to be obsequious in the face</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:59.980" style="s2">of a movement that is not what it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.550" end="00:05:02.140" style="s2">it just isn&#39;t you know with with regard</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.980" end="00:05:05.980" style="s2">to the good faith protest that started</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.140" end="00:05:08.920" style="s2">on the streets much of that is and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.980" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">stems from real real anger real hurt</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.920" end="00:05:15.670" style="s2">over actual history of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">oppression the riots are not that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.670" end="00:05:20.410" style="s2">the movement that has co-opted that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.980" end="00:05:23.350" style="s2">may in fact have been part of what set</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.410" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">those protests in motion is not that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.350" end="00:05:27.010" style="s2">certainly what is going on college</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:29.290" style="s2">campuses is not that because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.010" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">that there is active and ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.290" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">systemic oppression of of everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:40.990" style="s2">straight white males on college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">is flat-out batshit crazy it just is so</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.990" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">when we get to the analysis phase I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">to return to that clip and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:51.070" style="s2">point a philosophy of science lens at it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:53.110" style="s2">because this is the day in which those</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.070" end="00:05:55.660" style="s2">two things come crashing into each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.110" end="00:05:57.850" style="s2">yeah they do alright so Zak do you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.660" end="00:06:02.220" style="s2">to start with the so before actually let</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.850" end="00:06:04.750" style="s2">me set this up on May 23rd 2017 the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.220" end="00:06:06.580" style="s2">protesters the activists the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.750" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">would become rioters at Evergreen showed</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.580" end="00:06:10.990" style="s2">up in your classroom Brett and and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">later in the day that was 9:30 or so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.990" end="00:06:13.720" style="s2">the morning</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:16.390" style="s2">later in the day there was another very</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.720" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">public meeting that almost became</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.390" end="00:06:19.750" style="s2">violence on the fourth floor of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.060" style="s2">library building the so-called four</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.750" end="00:06:26.140" style="s2">o&#39;clock meeting in between those though</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.060" end="00:06:27.520" style="s2">was a private meeting between many of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.140" end="00:06:29.140" style="s2">the lead protesters I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.520" end="00:06:31.810" style="s2">many are there of them were there in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.140" end="00:06:33.370" style="s2">room 10 or 12 and all of the top admin</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.810" end="00:06:33.710" style="s2">at the Evergreen State College at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.370" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">time</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.670" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">of this when we first heard that we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.980" end="00:10:04.520" style="s2">shocked and then soon thereafter when</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:06.920" style="s2">the protesters became rioters and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.520" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">started doing both physical damage on</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:36.730" style="s2">had tenured jobs now we were here on the</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.750" end="00:16:51.459" style="s2">know we we had the police withdrawn from</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.560" end="00:16:53.670" style="s2">a riot against us and we watched the</p>

<p begin="00:17:19.569" end="00:17:25.600" style="s2">remember saying something about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.050" end="00:17:27.370" style="s2">what was unfolding was a challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.600" end="00:17:29.470" style="s2">enlightenment values and that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.370" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">academics had an obligation to defend</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.470" end="00:17:34.929" style="s2">them and I remember being stunned to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:37.060" style="s2">hear an attack on enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.929" end="00:17:38.950" style="s2">come back right not just</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.060" end="00:17:42.670" style="s2">the Enlightenment right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.950" end="00:17:45.550" style="s2">enlightenment values and you know at</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.670" end="00:17:48.550" style="s2">first I wish I understand to be rigor</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.550" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">and logic in combination with compassion</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.550" end="00:17:53.110" style="s2">for the humanity of all people right you</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.220" end="00:17:54.880" style="s2">know maybe that&#39;s a sort of strict dual</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.110" end="00:17:56.560" style="s2">ATO that&#39;s it&#39;s a really broad</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.880" end="00:17:59.890" style="s2">interpretation and a more narrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.560" end="00:18:03.070" style="s2">interpretation is just maybe about logic</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.890" end="00:18:04.600" style="s2">and rigor and and using science to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.070" end="00:18:07.570" style="s2">understand what we do in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.600" end="00:18:09.850" style="s2">even so even so those are the values</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.570" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">that you&#39;re fighting back against it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.850" end="00:18:14.170" style="s2">stunning to be I did I didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:16.450" style="s2">anybody could marshal such a broken</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.170" end="00:18:18.550" style="s2">argument in public and not have you know</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.580" end="00:18:24.610" style="s2">understood what enlightenment values are</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:26.170" style="s2">then because you couldn&#39;t possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.610" end="00:18:30.070" style="s2">attacking them but it was just silence</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.170" end="00:18:31.720" style="s2">right and all are scared that is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.070" end="00:18:33.790" style="s2">thing people need to understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.720" end="00:18:36.730" style="s2">at some level we&#39;ve said in other</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.790" end="00:18:39.090" style="s2">contexts that frequently you will</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.730" end="00:18:42.280" style="s2">understand what people are doing better</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.090" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">if you turn down the sound because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.280" end="00:18:47.590" style="s2">humans can&#39;t help but process language</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:51.220" style="s2">and if you listen to what people say</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.590" end="00:18:54.040" style="s2">they are doing then you will often be</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.220" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">misled if what they are doing is not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.040" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">same thing and so you have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">people who are saying that they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">looking forward to talking about bias in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:04.810" style="s2">the sciences okay there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:07.780" style="s2">with talking about bias in the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.810" end="00:19:10.420" style="s2">it exists and it has a long and dark</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.780" end="00:19:12.070" style="s2">history agreed but certainly certainly</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.420" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">up through the end of the 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.070" end="00:19:18.130" style="s2">it was a print it was actually primarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:19.930" style="s2">not just white and male endeavor but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.130" end="00:19:21.970" style="s2">also sort of a landed white and male</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.930" end="00:19:24.340" style="s2">endeavors it was it was for rich people</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.970" end="00:19:26.020" style="s2">and those rich people tended to be men</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.340" end="00:19:28.690" style="s2">and those rich people tended to be white</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.020" end="00:19:31.480" style="s2">and you know that what has happened in</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.690" end="00:19:34.870" style="s2">the 20th century in part is an opening</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.480" end="00:19:37.780" style="s2">up across all of those demographic</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.870" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">categories and you know obviously I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.780" end="00:19:43.330" style="s2">benefited from it being open to women</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">but I think more so the vatic everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.330" end="00:19:47.560" style="s2">effectively who&#39;s doing science today</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:48.820" style="s2">has benefited from it no longer being</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.560" end="00:19:50.860" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.820" end="00:19:53.920" style="s2">appropriate for the landed gentry right</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.860" end="00:19:55.030" style="s2">this is this is now actually open to to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.920" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">anyone under some there&#39;s a move away</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.030" end="00:19:57.460" style="s2">from that now we&#39;ve talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:03.700" style="s2">about the problems in modern science</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.460" end="00:20:06.580" style="s2">before but the fact that in theory you</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.700" end="00:20:09.010" style="s2">can get yourself into college and get</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.580" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">through and become a scientist no matter</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.010" end="00:20:12.940" style="s2">where you came from</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:15.010" style="s2">is wholly different from anything that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.940" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">was true of the Western scientific</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.010" end="00:20:19.420" style="s2">tradition up until I don&#39;t know at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:21.250" style="s2">the turn of the 19th or 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.420" end="00:20:22.600" style="s2">yeah the door is wide open which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.250" end="00:20:24.370" style="s2">mean people are walking through it in</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.600" end="00:20:26.290" style="s2">numbers that are proportional to their</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.370" end="00:20:27.790" style="s2">numbers in the population and it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.290" end="00:20:29.140" style="s2">certainly worth talking about why that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.790" end="00:20:30.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t the case and what might be done</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.140" end="00:20:33.610" style="s2">about it I think it would be wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.610" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">if people did show up in numbers that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.610" end="00:20:39.490" style="s2">were proportional but nonetheless if</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.790" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">the last 20 years I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.490" end="00:22:41.590" style="s2">evidence of it and and and we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">looking eventually even 50 years even</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.590" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">right and that&#39;s not to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:48.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t pretty recent history and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t been a lot of frankly evil</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.550" end="00:22:53.560" style="s2">done in the guise of in the uniform of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:56.380" style="s2">science but that doesn&#39;t make it science</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.560" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">but just just like hashtag black lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.380" end="00:23:01.300" style="s2">matter is cloaking itself in something</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:04.390" style="s2">that sounds honorable and amazing and is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.300" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">not actually that inside the idea that</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">a scientific a scientific study it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.660" end="00:23:15.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the same misapprehension</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:18.330" style="s2">but even if it was let&#39;s transport</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.880" end="00:23:22.870" style="s2">ourselves back 50 or a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.330" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">right the cure for bad science is good</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.870" end="00:23:26.920" style="s2">science and it always has been</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:28.990" style="s2">science is a bias correction mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.920" end="00:23:30.460" style="s2">that&#39;s really the only thing it does you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.990" end="00:23:32.290" style="s2">don&#39;t need science to tell you things</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.460" end="00:23:32.920" style="s2">that are obvious you need science to</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.290" end="00:23:34.210" style="s2">tell you things that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.920" end="00:23:37.240" style="s2">counterintuitive which means that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.210" end="00:23:40.930" style="s2">whatever your biases are science is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.240" end="00:23:44.740" style="s2">tool for addressing them and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.930" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">further let&#39;s imagine so if you listen</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.740" end="00:23:48.970" style="s2">to the leaders of the movement and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:50.940" style="s2">listen to what their internal</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.970" end="00:23:53.620" style="s2">conversation sounds like they say look</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.940" end="00:23:55.480" style="s2">white supremacy is so baked in that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.620" end="00:23:57.070" style="s2">have to level the institution and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.480" end="00:23:58.150" style="s2">replace it with something else and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.070" end="00:24:00.760" style="s2">sometimes they will say something</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.150" end="00:24:03.130" style="s2">Afrocentric right now let&#39;s suppose for</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.760" end="00:24:06.430" style="s2">a moment that there was some other</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.130" end="00:24:08.620" style="s2">system that was interested in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.430" end="00:24:11.620" style="s2">true that&#39;s what science is about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.620" end="00:24:12.910" style="s2">true and it was self-correcting which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.620" end="00:24:14.380" style="s2">the beauty of science the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.910" end="00:24:15.820" style="s2">separates it from every other method</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.380" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">let&#39;s suppose that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.820" end="00:24:19.390" style="s2">did have an alternative method all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:21.310" style="s2">better if it comes from Africa lovely</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.390" end="00:24:22.750" style="s2">okay so you&#39;ve got some other method</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.310" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">that is both self-correcting and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.750" end="00:24:26.980" style="s2">interested in the truth what will happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.290" style="s2">to it if you set it in motion it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.980" end="00:24:31.660" style="s2">converge on enlightenment science that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.290" end="00:24:33.970" style="s2">what it&#39;ll do so at this point in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.660" end="00:24:35.740" style="s2">global economy it will and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.970" end="00:24:37.210" style="s2">there have been other enlightenment s--</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.740" end="00:24:39.070" style="s2">you know the Enlightenment that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.210" end="00:24:41.710" style="s2">talked about and when we refer to it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.070" end="00:24:43.450" style="s2">the European enlightenment but the Maya</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.710" end="00:24:45.370" style="s2">as we have talked about before the Maya</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.450" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">had an Enlightenment many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.370" end="00:24:50.290" style="s2">years before the Europeans did and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:52.360" style="s2">although we know very little about what</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.290" end="00:24:55.060" style="s2">their inner workings of their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:56.830" style="s2">was because almost their entire library</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.060" end="00:24:57.670" style="s2">was destroyed in fact by the Spaniards</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.830" end="00:24:59.320" style="s2">when they arrived</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.670" end="00:25:00.700" style="s2">although the Maya themselves were</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.320" end="00:25:02.800" style="s2">already a culture in decline at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.700" end="00:25:04.750" style="s2">point that the Spaniards arrived what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.800" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">do know is that they had astronomers</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.750" end="00:25:09.880" style="s2">they had scribes data concept of zero</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:13.060" style="s2">they had mathematics they had vast</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.880" end="00:25:15.040" style="s2">written literature they had they had</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.060" end="00:25:18.010" style="s2">they&#39;d had an Enlightenment advanced</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.010" end="00:25:22.810" style="s2">want to put caveats on it though you</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:25.270" style="s2">need two characteristics to guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.810" end="00:25:27.250" style="s2">that all you have to add is time before</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.270" end="00:25:29.140" style="s2">you rediscover science right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.250" end="00:25:31.060" style="s2">matter what the nature of a truth</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.140" end="00:25:33.250" style="s2">seeking self-correcting mechanism is it</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.060" end="00:25:35.590" style="s2">will inevitably land there and what that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.250" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">means is that the right thing to do if</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.590" end="00:25:40.360" style="s2">you really want to empower black people</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">and believe me I do if you really want</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.360" end="00:25:44.410" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:46.360" style="s2">the best thing you can do is you can arm</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.410" end="00:25:48.250" style="s2">them with the tools of science rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.360" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">than setting us back hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.250" end="00:25:51.490" style="s2">and waiting for some other method to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:53.620" style="s2">converge on discoveries we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.490" end="00:25:55.300" style="s2">got you can arm them you can democratize</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.620" end="00:25:57.130" style="s2">these tools which is exactly what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.300" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">were doing at Evergreen it is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.130" end="00:25:59.980" style="s2">why they had to come for us now this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:03.220" style="s2">the part that I think people are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.980" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">be totally bewildered by why if this</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.220" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">movement is so interested in empowering</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">black people would it attack a tool that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">was really their best weapon in order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">end whatever oppression remains and</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:20.110" style="s2">here&#39;s the reason this movement isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:23.170" style="s2">what it looks like this movement is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.110" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">false version of something that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:44.420" style="s2">they want is people empowered to check</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.420" end="00:26:48.770" style="s2">stand up and we saw this all over the</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.280" end="00:27:00.680" style="s2">and what did they say they said to ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.470" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">for evidence of racism is racism with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.680" end="00:27:04.790" style="s2">capital R now that&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:06.950" style="s2">preposterous circular bit of logic but</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.790" end="00:27:09.650" style="s2">the idea the more precisely to ask for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.950" end="00:27:12.230" style="s2">evidence of racism is evidence of racism</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.650" end="00:27:15.230" style="s2">yep so it&#39;s inescapable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.230" end="00:27:17.620" style="s2">hermetically sealed by design so now</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.230" end="00:27:20.870" style="s2">think about what you&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.620" end="00:27:23.930" style="s2">tens of thousands of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.870" end="00:27:25.970" style="s2">street marching behind banners that seem</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.930" end="00:27:27.830" style="s2">superficially like they might be pointed</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.970" end="00:27:30.530" style="s2">in the direction of something good but</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.830" end="00:27:32.360" style="s2">are actually Trojan horses hiding</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.530" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">something else most of them don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.360" end="00:27:35.660" style="s2">they&#39;re carrying Turgeon horses I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">think they have no idea yeah and even</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.660" end="00:27:40.670" style="s2">the ones so you point to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:43.150" style="s2">tweets that people are you said that</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.670" end="00:27:45.980" style="s2">they are basically saying don&#39;t hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.150" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly a component of it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.980" end="00:27:51.470" style="s2">there is something far more insidious</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">here when these people they see the mob</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.470" end="00:27:55.580" style="s2">coming they look at their skin they say</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">oh oh I don&#39;t want to be backed against</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.580" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">the wall and they figure out what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">have to say in order not to get backed</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:02.470" style="s2">against the wall to get the mob to move</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">on to somebody else a they are</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.470" end="00:28:06.170" style="s2">externalizing harm on to the next person</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:08.090" style="s2">right they have an obligation to stand</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.170" end="00:28:10.010" style="s2">up and by not standing up they make the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.090" end="00:28:11.450" style="s2">mob stronger and then the next person it</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.010" end="00:28:13.580" style="s2">backs against the wall has an even</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.450" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">bigger problem right so this is not cool</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.580" end="00:28:21.110" style="s2">but the worst part of it and we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">it hundreds of times is the individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.110" end="00:28:24.590" style="s2">says this thing to get the mob to leave</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">them alone</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.590" end="00:28:29.810" style="s2">and then they&#39;ve got a problem how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:32.630" style="s2">hell are you gonna sleep after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.810" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">done that right so what do they do they</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.630" end="00:28:37.250" style="s2">tell themselves that it&#39;s true right</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:38.810" style="s2">they forget what they knew and they tell</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.250" end="00:28:40.430" style="s2">themselves this is actually the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.810" end="00:28:42.890" style="s2">thing that&#39;s why I did it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.430" end="00:28:43.700" style="s2">and so now the point is the mob didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.890" end="00:28:46.940" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.700" end="00:28:50.350" style="s2">move on it actually captured their minds</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.940" end="00:28:52.520" style="s2">right now the reason that people like us</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.350" end="00:28:55.309" style="s2">were so animated</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.520" end="00:28:57.800" style="s2">after the Evergreen meltdown was that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.309" end="00:28:58.910" style="s2">saw this force take over lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.800" end="00:29:01.640" style="s2">of people who should know better and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.910" end="00:29:03.470" style="s2">after it took them over there was no</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.640" end="00:29:06.530" style="s2">place there was no place that you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.470" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">say it stops here which is why I said in</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.530" end="00:29:10.280" style="s2">that clip what I said it&#39;s why I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.170" style="s2">the same thing to Congress all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.280" end="00:29:15.140" style="s2">this is going to eventually spill over</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.170" end="00:29:18.290" style="s2">into anything now truth be told I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.140" end="00:29:22.370" style="s2">impressed at the speed but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.290" end="00:29:24.830" style="s2">the mechanism was obvious and well</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.370" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s it is very important that</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.830" end="00:29:28.910" style="s2">you think what is the most parsimonious</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:30.890" style="s2">explanation for what I&#39;m seeing is this</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.910" end="00:29:32.630" style="s2">an honest confusion about whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.890" end="00:29:37.309" style="s2">science is a good thing or is this a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.630" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">demonstration of power yeah it is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.309" end="00:29:43.250" style="s2">demonstration of power</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:45.380" style="s2">let me show another screen Zak my</p>

<p begin="00:30:02.210" end="00:30:06.110" style="s2">particularly important so this is put</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:07.429" style="s2">together by some particle physicists</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.110" end="00:30:12.020" style="s2">including one who will say a few more</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.429" end="00:30:14.179" style="s2">words about here shortly this oops this</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.020" end="00:30:15.770" style="s2">paragraph here therefore as physicists</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.179" end="00:30:17.960" style="s2">we believe an academic strike is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.770" end="00:30:19.460" style="s2">urgently needed to hit pause to give</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.460" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">others an opportunity to reflect on</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.190" end="00:30:32.360" style="s2">interesting I think this hashtag strike</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.770" end="00:30:34.070" style="s2">for black lives is in dialogue with a</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:07.790" style="s2">that much and the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.350" end="00:31:09.560" style="s2">is what you were just saying that no</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.790" end="00:31:11.330" style="s2">this isn&#39;t actually what it appears this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.560" end="00:31:13.130" style="s2">is not actually in service of ending</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.330" end="00:31:15.230" style="s2">racism that is that is not what is going</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.130" end="00:31:16.460" style="s2">on here although many of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.230" end="00:31:18.050" style="s2">are participating think it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.460" end="00:31:20.900" style="s2">going on here those two things can</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.050" end="00:31:23.480" style="s2">simultaneously be true and they are but</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.900" end="00:31:25.310" style="s2">just like defund the police oh we don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:31.790" style="s2">we&#39;d like but actually they do or at</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:33.620" style="s2">least some of them do same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.790" end="00:31:35.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a one-day strike come on can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.620" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">get behind that what are you racist</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.480" end="00:31:41.780" style="s2">well let&#39;s shut down stem and shut down</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:46.910" style="s2">academia for at least the day of June</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:48.290" style="s2">that but let me just share a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.460" end="00:32:50.780" style="s2">things that I said there just a couple</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.290" end="00:32:52.430" style="s2">of lines quote shutting down dissent is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.780" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">a classic authoritarian move and will</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.430" end="00:32:56.060" style="s2">not result in less oppression you will</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:32:59.480" style="s2">send the dissenters underground and they</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.060" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">will seek truth without you science and</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.480" end="00:33:03.050" style="s2">scientists need to respond the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:04.160" style="s2">not in and of itself oppressive to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.050" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">extent that selection has produced</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.410" end="00:33:11.910" style="s2">hardly legit</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.050" end="00:33:13.530" style="s2">response so that is in reference of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.910" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">course the d&#39;amore memo which no did not</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.530" end="00:33:17.130" style="s2">claim that men and women are differently</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.230" style="s2">abled even he just claimed he could take</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.130" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">it down sack he just he just made the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.230" end="00:33:24.330" style="s2">observation which is backed by empirical</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:26.180" style="s2">science that given free choice men and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.330" end="00:33:28.200" style="s2">women tend to make somewhat different</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.180" end="00:33:30.710" style="s2">choices about what they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.200" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">and what they want to do on average</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.710" end="00:33:40.740" style="s2">between populations anyway so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.260" end="00:33:42.660" style="s2">try to orient people to our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.740" end="00:33:45.650" style="s2">obviously you hit the nail on the head</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.660" end="00:33:50.130" style="s2">in your article that would have been in</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.650" end="00:33:52.380" style="s2">2017 yeah so ok that&#39;s interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.130" end="00:33:54.870" style="s2">and I have both predicted the future and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.380" end="00:33:58.650" style="s2">it has arrived quickly and in very</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.870" end="00:34:02.610" style="s2">dramatic form but what I want to point</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.650" end="00:34:05.010" style="s2">out is the philosophy of science is</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.610" end="00:34:08.700" style="s2">actually applicable to this not</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.010" end="00:34:13.470" style="s2">explicitly scientific discussion science</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.700" end="00:34:15.570" style="s2">has you hypothesize the explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.470" end="00:34:18.179" style="s2">a pattern and then make a prediction and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.570" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">test it the purpose of that exercise is</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.179" end="00:34:22.350" style="s2">not the testing of prediction scientific</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">experiment is not the sin qua non of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.350" end="00:34:27.900" style="s2">science the important thing is that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:30.990" style="s2">hypothesis the model of reality that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.900" end="00:34:32.640" style="s2">generates the prediction gets credit for</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.990" end="00:34:34.740" style="s2">the prediction when it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.640" end="00:34:38.070" style="s2">true or in technical language</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.740" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">it remains unfalsifiable</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.070" end="00:34:43.620" style="s2">so what that means is that when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:45.480" style="s2">got a true prediction you should look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.620" end="00:34:48.270" style="s2">the model that generated it and say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.480" end="00:34:50.520" style="s2">model appears to be somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.270" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">ballpark of correct what else does it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.520" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">say that&#39;s the important part what else</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:34:57.930" style="s2">does it say so just just make sure you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:35:01.500" style="s2">have to be very careful that your</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.930" end="00:35:02.940" style="s2">predictions not just inherently followed</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.500" end="00:35:04.110" style="s2">from the model but that there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.940" end="00:35:05.460" style="s2">other models that made the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.110" end="00:35:07.050" style="s2">prediction right you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.460" end="00:35:08.730" style="s2">in both directions so there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.050" end="00:35:10.110" style="s2">things that tell you the quality of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.730" end="00:35:11.580" style="s2">prediction so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.110" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">tells you the quality of a prediction is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.580" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">if it&#39;s unique to the hypothesis in</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:16.620" style="s2">question or does it reflect well on</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.660" style="s2">several hypotheses at once another one</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.620" end="00:35:21.330" style="s2">would be is it counterintuitive if a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.660" end="00:35:23.130" style="s2">prediction is intuitive then it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.330" end="00:35:23.790" style="s2">very strong test if R objection is wild</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.130" end="00:35:25.590" style="s2">to counter into</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.790" end="00:35:28.470" style="s2">then it&#39;s a great test when it shows up</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.590" end="00:35:32.790" style="s2">so for example Einstein&#39;s prediction</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.470" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">that the light of stars would be where</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.790" end="00:35:37.700" style="s2">that light is bent by gravity which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">then tested by the observation that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.700" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">the Sun bends the light of distant stars</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:44.520" style="s2">which is something you can&#39;t observe</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:46.980" style="s2">directly and so we don&#39;t know it to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.520" end="00:35:49.560" style="s2">true you can only see it during an</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.980" end="00:35:51.420" style="s2">eclipse when the Sun is darkened but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.560" end="00:35:52.800" style="s2">Starlight behind it is still visible so</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:53.820" style="s2">you can detect this gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.800" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">lensing all right</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.820" end="00:35:59.340" style="s2">that&#39;s an amazing prediction because a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:36:00.750" style="s2">it&#39;s so strange to imagine that gravity</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.340" end="00:36:01.920" style="s2">is going to bend light nobody would</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.750" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">think to predict it it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.920" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">counterintuitive and the second thing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:11.750" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s so it&#39;s very easily</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:14.640" style="s2">demonstrated so you&#39;re easy to check so</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.750" end="00:36:16.920" style="s2">so the more people are surprised by a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.640" end="00:36:18.660" style="s2">prediction and who think it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.920" end="00:36:22.050" style="s2">the riskier the prediction as it were</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.660" end="00:36:25.170" style="s2">right actually if it is borne out the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.050" end="00:36:27.720" style="s2">better a test it is actually been of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.170" end="00:36:28.890" style="s2">hypothesis in question rescue that when</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.720" end="00:36:31.530" style="s2">when you have two predictions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.890" end="00:36:33.120" style="s2">hypothesis both of which inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.530" end="00:36:35.790" style="s2">follow from that hypothesis and they do</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.120" end="00:36:37.860" style="s2">not follow from any other hypotheses if</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.790" end="00:36:40.200" style="s2">you have a risky prediction at a non</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.860" end="00:36:42.270" style="s2">risky prediction you can test the non</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.200" end="00:36:44.370" style="s2">risky prediction but it is not nearly as</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.270" end="00:36:46.020" style="s2">strong a test of the hypothesis than</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.370" end="00:36:47.850" style="s2">testing the risky prediction yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.020" end="00:36:49.050" style="s2">reflects weakly positively on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.850" end="00:36:50.550" style="s2">hypothesis where as a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.050" end="00:36:52.050" style="s2">counterintuitive totally unique</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.550" end="00:36:54.660" style="s2">prediction reflects strongly on it but</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.050" end="00:36:56.490" style="s2">here&#39;s the point now we have a thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.660" end="00:36:58.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not an explicitly scientific kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.490" end="00:37:00.990" style="s2">of prediction right you predict the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.260" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">future I predicted the future Eric has</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.990" end="00:37:05.940" style="s2">predicted the future so many times right</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:08.190" style="s2">that the point is the real question is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.940" end="00:37:10.020" style="s2">okay how are you doing that right you</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.190" end="00:37:11.610" style="s2">have a time machine or do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.020" end="00:37:13.290" style="s2">model that tells you what&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.610" end="00:37:14.700" style="s2">on so that where other people are caught</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.290" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">off guard you actually see it ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.700" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">time and if so what else does your model</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:22.140" style="s2">say that&#39;s the real question and so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:23.790" style="s2">hate to be the one saying that because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.140" end="00:37:26.370" style="s2">am among the people who have predicted</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.790" end="00:37:28.770" style="s2">this event would happen but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.370" end="00:37:31.290" style="s2">the important question then is all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.770" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">who got this one right shouldn&#39;t we be</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.290" end="00:37:35.210" style="s2">elevating them in the conversation it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.390" end="00:39:34.819" style="s2">starts as all movements will is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.849" end="00:39:37.279" style="s2">niche thing over in some made up fields</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.819" end="00:39:39.140" style="s2">in the you know made up fields I want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.279" end="00:39:40.279" style="s2">say you know they claim to be instead of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.140" end="00:39:41.779" style="s2">humanities and Social Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.279" end="00:39:44.119" style="s2">but they just they don&#39;t they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.779" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">deserve that title the humanities are</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.119" end="00:39:49.460" style="s2">real and necessary to a full and rich</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.140" style="s2">understanding of the human experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.460" end="00:39:52.940" style="s2">the study of literature this too</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.140" end="00:39:54.920" style="s2">history the study of philosophy these</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.940" end="00:39:57.110" style="s2">are real and necessary fields when done</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.920" end="00:40:00.410" style="s2">right and there are many ways to do them</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.110" end="00:40:04.820" style="s2">right but almost everything that ends in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.410" end="00:40:08.270" style="s2">studies is not that so let&#39;s talk for a</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.820" end="00:40:11.180" style="s2">second about Rhonda Prescott one I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.270" end="00:40:14.660" style="s2">gonna assume it&#39;s Weinstein just put her</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2">over with Harvey done with it I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.660" end="00:40:19.780" style="s2">say that but I will say I don&#39;t want any</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.150" end="00:40:24.230" style="s2">association with her nonsense but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.780" end="00:40:27.080" style="s2">the the fact is we are not going to end</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.230" end="00:40:31.610" style="s2">up disbanding science but they&#39;re shut</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.080" end="00:40:32.990" style="s2">down stem thing is so again a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.610" end="00:40:35.870" style="s2">motte-and-bailey would have two versions</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.990" end="00:40:38.420" style="s2">right you would have a strong version</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.870" end="00:40:40.550" style="s2">and then a retreat position that was</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.420" end="00:40:42.320" style="s2">secure right so the strong version is</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.550" end="00:40:43.850" style="s2">there&#39;s some massive problem with</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.320" end="00:40:46.580" style="s2">science and we need to transform it into</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.850" end="00:40:50.840" style="s2">something new and then the weak version</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.580" end="00:40:52.310" style="s2">is can&#39;t you just shut down for a day to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.840" end="00:40:55.460" style="s2">acknowledge that it hasn&#39;t all been</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.310" end="00:40:58.520" style="s2">hunky-dory race wise in science in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.460" end="00:41:03.020" style="s2">past right that retreat position is not</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.520" end="00:41:04.490" style="s2">long but but the point is it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.020" end="00:41:07.790" style="s2">wrong if this was actually what it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.490" end="00:41:10.100" style="s2">climbing to right but the idea what</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.790" end="00:41:13.550" style="s2">would it cost if you were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.100" end="00:41:15.800" style="s2">corrupt science magazine right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.550" end="00:41:17.450" style="s2">science magazine is already corrupt but</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.800" end="00:41:19.130" style="s2">if you were trying to corrupt it to your</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.450" end="00:41:21.980" style="s2">own ends and you wanted to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.130" end="00:41:25.190" style="s2">broadcast a hashtag of your choosing</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.980" end="00:41:27.800" style="s2">right that reflected some bias of yours</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.190" end="00:41:30.980" style="s2">the price point would be astronomically</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.800" end="00:41:33.560" style="s2">high right science would be very good at</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.980" end="00:41:35.750" style="s2">resisting anything that you tried to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.560" end="00:41:37.670" style="s2">bring into their office and disguise as</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.750" end="00:41:40.610" style="s2">something lovely just to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.670" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">broadcast it to enrich you okay this</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.610" end="00:41:47.690" style="s2">movement has actually managed to get</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:50.930" style="s2">science magazine to broadcast shut down</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.690" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">stem right like if you asked me what</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.930" end="00:41:56.180" style="s2">would you have to do to get science</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:59.660" style="s2">magazine to broadcast a call to shut</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.180" end="00:42:02.630" style="s2">down stem III would say it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.660" end="00:42:03.350" style="s2">but for the fact that at this moment you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.630" end="00:42:05.240" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.350" end="00:42:06.920" style="s2">I hate to say it I know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.240" end="00:42:08.990" style="s2">renegades among the Millennials we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.920" end="00:42:10.460" style="s2">taught them for years but almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.990" end="00:42:12.170" style="s2">our students for Millennials and almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.460" end="00:42:13.970" style="s2">all of them were actually amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.170" end="00:42:15.800" style="s2">interested in truth and interested in</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.970" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">discomfort if it allowed them a better</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.800" end="00:42:19.850" style="s2">model of the world so yeah they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">easy it&#39;s easy to paint a brush across</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.850" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">an entire generation it is mostly the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">Millennials who are protesting on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:29.750" style="s2">streets and rioting on the streets but</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">we know we know that there are you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.750" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">a tremendous number of people who are</p>

<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:40.430" style="s2">are capable of simultaneously valuing</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.160" end="00:42:42.470" style="s2">right rationality and compassion well on</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.430" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">the one hand the streets are everything</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.470" end="00:42:44.450" style="s2">and on the other hand they&#39;re nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.450" end="00:42:49.610" style="s2">what&#39;s going on on the streets is part</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">of a larger plan all right so somebody</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.610" end="00:42:55.580" style="s2">one of the people who I&#39;m in dialogue</p>

<p begin="00:43:15.740" end="00:43:19.130" style="s2">at the mob of a thousand people each</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.330" end="00:43:20.420" style="s2">person can set the slider where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.130" end="00:43:22.370" style="s2">comfortable with it and they can all</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.420" end="00:43:25.250" style="s2">move together towards this goal and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.370" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">you know the amazing aggressive position</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.250" end="00:43:27.830" style="s2">wins in the end because all of these</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.830" end="00:43:32.330" style="s2">they&#39;re advocating for their right level</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.050" end="00:43:34.610" style="s2">anyway one of the people that I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.330" end="00:43:36.080" style="s2">dialogue with suggested something I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.610" end="00:43:39.080" style="s2">never heard of before called above and</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.080" end="00:43:40.760" style="s2">below which there&#39;s not much evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.080" end="00:43:42.920" style="s2">this discussion I know that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.760" end="00:43:44.570" style="s2">little it&#39;s apparently affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.920" end="00:43:46.190" style="s2">communism although I won&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.570" end="00:43:48.860" style="s2">if it&#39;s more general than this but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.190" end="00:43:51.080" style="s2">has to do affiliated with the people who</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.590" end="00:44:02.030" style="s2">has to do with basically using creating</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.750" end="00:44:04.730" style="s2">a mob to create the impression of demand</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.030" end="00:44:07.550" style="s2">for some kind of change and then using</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.730" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">that impression of a mob that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.550" end="00:44:12.380" style="s2">demanding change to get elected</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.190" end="00:44:14.060" style="s2">officials and things to capitulate to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.380" end="00:44:16.490" style="s2">the public right it&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.060" end="00:44:17.090" style="s2">pseudo populist thing I mean the public</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.490" end="00:44:18.110" style="s2">if you told</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:19.160" style="s2">public I don&#39;t know actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.110" end="00:44:21.890" style="s2">really interested in shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.160" end="00:44:23.840" style="s2">science you know they look at you like</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.890" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">you were crazy yeah I mean it is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.840" end="00:44:28.100" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:29.510" style="s2">some some account with zero followers</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.100" end="00:44:31.820" style="s2">which could be a sock puppet or it could</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.510" end="00:44:33.830" style="s2">be somebody who&#39;s afraid and so has made</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.820" end="00:44:37.100" style="s2">a new account tweeted something like how</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.830" end="00:44:39.650" style="s2">ironic to broadcast hashtag shutdown</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.100" end="00:44:41.420" style="s2">stem from your super sophisticated cell</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.650" end="00:44:47.930" style="s2">phone yeah right I mean it is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.420" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">ironic but in any case we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.930" end="00:44:53.840" style="s2">got a power grab that has a game</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:56.360" style="s2">theoretic mechanism for using whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.840" end="00:45:01.490" style="s2">power it has to marshal more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.360" end="00:45:04.600" style="s2">force the important thing is not the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.490" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">street the street is like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.600" end="00:45:11.060" style="s2">demonstration of the amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.130" end="00:45:13.250" style="s2">and the amount of energy is used to take</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.060" end="00:45:15.260" style="s2">institutions and topple them from within</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.250" end="00:45:16.610" style="s2">so I think the real story which we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.260" end="00:45:20.330" style="s2">not seeing while we are paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.610" end="00:45:22.670" style="s2">to the street is inside of every single</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.330" end="00:45:25.250" style="s2">institution of a certain size there is a</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.710" end="00:45:34.790" style="s2">only we&#39;ve also now seen you know</p>

<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:35.830" style="s2">here we know where this goes but imagine</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.830" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">institutions imagine that you were at</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.720" end="00:46:41.500" style="s2">science magazine now we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:44.350" style="s2">anything about what happened in science</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.500" end="00:46:46.120" style="s2">magazine other then something happened</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.350" end="00:46:49.330" style="s2">that caused science magazine to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.120" end="00:46:51.610" style="s2">broadcast shut down stem and to stop</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.330" end="00:46:54.460" style="s2">doing anything else for the day right</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.610" end="00:46:57.400" style="s2">we know that the movement when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.460" end="00:46:58.780" style="s2">to it directly is very clear on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.400" end="00:47:01.450" style="s2">that it&#39;s not that they want to reform</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.780" end="00:47:04.330" style="s2">stem they actually find stem to be their</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.450" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">enemy and we can infer why that is so</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.330" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">imagine the Millennials right we&#39;re Gen</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:15.400" style="s2">X Gen X is a tiny generation it is now</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:17.410" style="s2">sort of upper echelon in these</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.400" end="00:47:19.720" style="s2">institutions right just by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.410" end="00:47:21.640" style="s2">seniority but other boomers are still</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.720" end="00:47:24.610" style="s2">more senior but they&#39;re more senior but</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.640" end="00:47:26.380" style="s2">they&#39;re also pretty old right and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.610" end="00:47:28.750" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.380" end="00:47:30.460" style="s2">Gen X at the top but it&#39;s not very large</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.750" end="00:47:32.650" style="s2">in numbers yeah actually I actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.460" end="00:47:34.150" style="s2">don&#39;t think that Gen X is yet heading up</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.650" end="00:47:37.030" style="s2">admins I think it&#39;s still boomers who</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.150" end="00:47:39.610" style="s2">are heading up universities and colleges</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.030" end="00:47:41.140" style="s2">and mainstream media and such well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.610" end="00:47:42.820" style="s2">would say at the very top anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.140" end="00:47:44.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting question and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.820" end="00:47:47.020" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s an empirical question</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.050" end="00:47:49.450" style="s2">yeah but in any case what you do have is</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.020" end="00:47:51.910" style="s2">the rank and file in these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.450" end="00:47:53.650" style="s2">is millennial there are a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.910" end="00:47:55.510" style="s2">they are rightly angry they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.650" end="00:47:57.870" style="s2">handed a bad deal terrible deal a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.510" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">terrible deal so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.870" end="00:48:02.680" style="s2">interest in change not much</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">sophistication I would say about what</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.680" end="00:48:05.470" style="s2">change ought to look like so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:07.030" style="s2">just pent-up energy</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.470" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">well they had crap education at some</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.030" end="00:48:12.430" style="s2">level they didn&#39;t this you know just</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:13.870" style="s2">just returned to the that final point</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.430" end="00:48:15.070" style="s2">that I made in those fourteen points and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.870" end="00:48:17.020" style="s2">I made a couple of livestreams ago</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.070" end="00:48:19.270" style="s2">they&#39;ve just as you said they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.020" end="00:48:21.220" style="s2">handed a terrible deal most of them are</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.270" end="00:48:22.840" style="s2">dead they had terrible education they</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.220" end="00:48:25.240" style="s2">have no chance of owning property they</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.840" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">have terrible health care they&#39;ve mostly</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.240" end="00:48:29.140" style="s2">been you know on legal pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">for so much their lives they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.140" end="00:48:31.900" style="s2">even know how ordered their own moods</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:33.880" style="s2">and their own psychologies or interpret</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.900" end="00:48:36.190" style="s2">those of others and they&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.880" end="00:48:37.480" style="s2">online and you know of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.190" end="00:48:39.460" style="s2">confused and of course they&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.480" end="00:48:40.849" style="s2">well of course they&#39;re angry they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.460" end="00:48:42.950" style="s2">good reason to being there</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.849" end="00:48:46.249" style="s2">angry and a movement outdoors that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.950" end="00:48:51.789" style="s2">formerly about the murder of a black man</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.249" end="00:48:54.920" style="s2">but is actually quite obviously about a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.789" end="00:48:56.509" style="s2">demand for change has been co-opted by</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.920" end="00:48:59.059" style="s2">people who are selling a particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.509" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2">phony story about what&#39;s wrong and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.059" end="00:49:02.259" style="s2">to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.900" end="00:49:06.710" style="s2">but anyway there&#39;s a lot of fervor for</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.259" end="00:49:08.180" style="s2">just signing on because hey change is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.710" end="00:49:09.799" style="s2">good if things suck change is good no</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.180" end="00:49:12.019" style="s2">that&#39;s not true change I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.799" end="00:49:13.849" style="s2">the problem a lot of if you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.019" end="00:49:15.769" style="s2">listening to us because we correctly</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.849" end="00:49:18.829" style="s2">predicted what was going to happen then</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.769" end="00:49:21.650" style="s2">our current conversation is well we told</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.829" end="00:49:24.499" style="s2">you this looked Maoist now project that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.650" end="00:49:29.769" style="s2">thing to the scale of Nations and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.499" end="00:49:33.470" style="s2">know why this is preoccupying us but</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.769" end="00:49:35.479" style="s2">inside of science right some battle</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.470" end="00:49:39.170" style="s2">presumably took place or a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.479" end="00:49:41.029" style="s2">people who have behind them as they</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.170" end="00:49:42.859" style="s2">approach the question of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.029" end="00:49:44.479" style="s2">to shut down one of the premier science</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.859" end="00:49:47.029" style="s2">journals for the day and turn it into a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.479" end="00:49:50.599" style="s2">megaphone for the George Florida</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.029" end="00:49:55.309" style="s2">protests all right they have images on</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.599" end="00:49:57.499" style="s2">every screen of violent unrest in cities</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.309" end="00:50:00.140" style="s2">across the nation and increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.499" end="00:50:02.809" style="s2">across the world right so that seems</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.140" end="00:50:04.700" style="s2">like a reason to listen and for the kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.809" end="00:50:06.650" style="s2">of cowards who end up in administrative</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.700" end="00:50:08.930" style="s2">positions in large institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.650" end="00:50:11.029" style="s2">frankly it&#39;s a lot of cowards right</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.930" end="00:50:12.710" style="s2">tirely we&#39;ve known a few non cowardly</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.029" end="00:50:14.930" style="s2">administrators but and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.710" end="00:50:18.829" style="s2">first against the wall well evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.930" end="00:50:20.119" style="s2">one of them was yep before us he was</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.829" end="00:50:22.999" style="s2">gotten rid of first Michael Zimmerman</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.119" end="00:50:26.569" style="s2">indeed Michael Zimmerman who was very</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.999" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">courageous very courageous Provost was</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.569" end="00:50:31.999" style="s2">shoved out by George bridges before the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:33.859" style="s2">madness unfolded I mean he he would have</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.999" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">been in opposition to it all the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.859" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">along so they got rid of him for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:37.579" style="s2">same reason they got rid of us so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:39.499" style="s2">the courageous people are gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.579" end="00:50:41.900" style="s2">tossed out that&#39;s just what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.499" end="00:50:44.150" style="s2">then the institutions are gonna topple</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.900" end="00:50:47.239" style="s2">into the hands of this thing right</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.150" end="00:50:50.450" style="s2">where does Shonda prescott weinstein end</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.239" end="00:50:53.329" style="s2">up after physics has been brought to its</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.450" end="00:50:54.360" style="s2">knees i think she&#39;s one of our new top</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.329" end="00:50:57.360" style="s2">physicists</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.360" end="00:50:59.340" style="s2">why because there aren&#39;t enough black</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.360" end="00:51:01.110" style="s2">physicists which is probably true</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.340" end="00:51:04.530" style="s2">well you know and you say this we say</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.110" end="00:51:06.450" style="s2">this I at least have no idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.530" end="00:51:10.770" style="s2">value what the rigor of her science is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.450" end="00:51:16.440" style="s2">have no idea but she is clearly one</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.770" end="00:51:18.060" style="s2">effect of this will be to to win in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:21.030" style="s2">system that is supposed to be about</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.060" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">merit but in which she will win based on</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.030" end="00:51:25.770" style="s2">her lineage the color of her skin this</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:28.260" style="s2">is the kind of science that we had in</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.770" end="00:51:29.910" style="s2">the 19th century yep it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.260" end="00:51:32.070" style="s2">lineage that&#39;s winning now but it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.910" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">exactly what was going on then and it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.070" end="00:51:39.930" style="s2">not legitimate it is not ok so at some</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.600" style="s2">level I worry about just repeating it so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.930" end="00:51:44.460" style="s2">much that it gets lost but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.600" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">saying from the beginning that part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.460" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">the problem here is that there are two</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:51.330" style="s2">movements fused together there are</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:53.310" style="s2">people who earnestly want change in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.330" end="00:51:56.070" style="s2">realm where it is necessary who would</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.310" end="00:51:58.890" style="s2">love to end oppression and then there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.070" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">a cynical self-interested movement that</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.890" end="00:52:02.040" style="s2">wants to turn the tables of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:03.090" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t turn the tables of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.040" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">oppression on people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.090" end="00:52:07.110" style="s2">oppressing it takes these very crude</p>

<p begin="00:55:26.800" end="00:55:31.590" style="s2">and he really needed a and Ezra Klein to</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.690" end="00:55:53.830" style="s2">so this is maybe not nearly as</p>

<p begin="00:55:53.830" end="00:56:01.440" style="s2">but there is an insane piece that came</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.020" end="00:57:06.370" style="s2">and what is going on with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.090" end="00:57:08.080" style="s2">responses to her but one of them is this</p>

<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:49.510" style="s2">means that you will probably be called a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.770" end="00:57:51.640" style="s2">racist and that has become in the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.510" end="00:57:53.829" style="s2">century one of the scariest things to be</p>

<p begin="00:58:43.060" end="00:58:49.780" style="s2">then you do survive and you emerge going</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.750" end="00:58:53.260" style="s2">huh that didn&#39;t kill me being being</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.780" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">called that did not turn out to do the</p>

<p begin="00:58:55.119" end="00:59:02.230" style="s2">have never been less happy to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.800" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">with you than I am right now okay um I</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.230" end="00:59:09.609" style="s2">disagree with the amount I think that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">perspective is now out of date as of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.609" end="00:59:13.480" style="s2">couple of weeks ago okay so you think it</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:14.680" style="s2">was true when we were going through what</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.480" end="00:59:16.630" style="s2">we went through but it&#39;s not true now</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.680" end="00:59:18.190" style="s2">well I think there was a way in which it</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.630" end="00:59:22.900" style="s2">was true I don&#39;t think it was safe but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.190" end="00:59:24.460" style="s2">think there was a way to to jump but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.900" end="00:59:25.960" style="s2">think what we are now seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.460" end="00:59:29.589" style="s2">happening at a scale and with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.960" end="00:59:32.500" style="s2">ferocity that we are now back in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.589" end="00:59:36.310" style="s2">landscape where the hazard of saying</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.500" end="00:59:37.930" style="s2">what&#39;s true is high and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.310" end="00:59:40.089" style="s2">putting people in a predicament where</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.930" end="00:59:41.970" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to make a real choice</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.089" end="00:59:45.089" style="s2">it&#39;s not simple</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.970" end="00:59:47.430" style="s2">but there&#39;s no winning if you if you lie</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.089" end="00:59:49.740" style="s2">alright if you if you do this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.430" end="00:59:52.099" style="s2">please don&#39;t hurt me or I&#39;m going to do</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.099" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they won&#39;t come for you</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.299" end="00:59:57.569" style="s2">anyway right no there&#39;s nothing you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="00:59:58.859" style="s2">do to appease the mob there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.569" end="01:00:00.150" style="s2">that you can do that&#39;s sufficient and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.859" end="01:00:02.069" style="s2">the bigger your profile the more true</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.150" end="01:00:04.619" style="s2">that is I&#39;m not I&#39;m not arguing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.069" end="01:00:07.230" style="s2">this is a difficult choice I mean in</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.619" end="01:00:08.869" style="s2">fact I was in dialogue with Robbie</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.230" end="01:00:11.640" style="s2">George yesterday and we were both</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.869" end="01:00:15.329" style="s2">remarking on the fact that people see</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.640" end="01:00:17.369" style="s2">standing up to the mob as courageous but</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.329" end="01:00:19.349" style="s2">that actually there there are certain</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.369" end="01:00:21.240" style="s2">ways that you could be wired that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.349" end="01:00:24.510" style="s2">just there isn&#39;t a choice alright and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.240" end="01:00:26.819" style="s2">feel this way for me for sure it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.510" end="01:00:29.039" style="s2">like people say ha I&#39;m so glad you you</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.819" end="01:00:31.740" style="s2">stood up and you didn&#39;t count out of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.039" end="01:00:33.270" style="s2">mob and it was like whoa I can&#39;t I so</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.740" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">can&#39;t relate to what that would have</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.270" end="01:00:40.430" style="s2">been like that it&#39;s you know it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:43.250" style="s2">automatic but but what I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.430" end="01:00:45.420" style="s2">look you are gonna be offered a choice</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.250" end="01:00:47.640" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to stand up or</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.420" end="01:00:51.720" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to become complicit</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.640" end="01:00:55.020" style="s2">with and then part of this mob and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.720" end="01:00:59.130" style="s2">problem is I can&#39;t say that you will end</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.020" end="01:01:01.829" style="s2">up winning if you say the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.130" end="01:01:03.569" style="s2">this is a frightening moment we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.829" end="01:01:05.880" style="s2">watching something with revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.569" end="01:01:08.760" style="s2">potential and it&#39;s telling us what it</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.880" end="01:01:11.029" style="s2">wants and it&#39;s a frightening redo of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.760" end="01:01:14.250" style="s2">some of the worst episodes in history</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.029" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">what I can say is if you do the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.250" end="01:01:19.260" style="s2">thing you will definitely feel better</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:21.359" style="s2">about it and although the number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.260" end="01:01:23.730" style="s2">people who will interact with you we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.359" end="01:01:26.039" style="s2">will talk to you may shrink dramatically</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.730" end="01:01:29.250" style="s2">and the vileness of things that are said</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.039" end="01:01:32.549" style="s2">to you and about you may go up you will</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.250" end="01:01:33.990" style="s2">join the ranks of the courageous and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.549" end="01:01:35.670" style="s2">intelligent people who have both of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.990" end="01:01:39.089" style="s2">those characteristics are going to end</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.670" end="01:01:41.490" style="s2">up separated from everybody else by the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.089" end="01:01:43.349" style="s2">willingness or the necessity to stand up</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.490" end="01:01:46.140" style="s2">and say what&#39;s true in the face of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.349" end="01:01:48.210" style="s2">nonsense so and they won&#39;t think like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.140" end="01:01:50.970" style="s2">you in every other way and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.210" end="01:01:53.910" style="s2">important and good but the number of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.970" end="01:01:54.299" style="s2">people whom we now know whom we can now</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.910" end="01:01:58.049" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.299" end="01:01:59.429" style="s2">and who are now known to us in the wake</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.049" end="01:02:01.829" style="s2">of what happened at Evergreen three</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.429" end="01:02:04.140" style="s2">years ago who are both intelligent and</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.829" end="01:02:08.999" style="s2">courageous and who hold no truck with</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.140" end="01:02:11.179" style="s2">this nonsense is large yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.999" end="01:02:14.759" style="s2">concerned a little but I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.179" end="01:02:15.989" style="s2">decry the idea of the right side of</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.759" end="01:02:17.519" style="s2">history as if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.989" end="01:02:19.439" style="s2">defective about that claim as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.519" end="01:02:22.289" style="s2">cultish to even imagine that such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.439" end="01:02:24.059" style="s2">thing exists I regard this as nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.289" end="01:02:26.729" style="s2">there is a right side to history it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.059" end="01:02:28.739" style="s2">not always obvious to those in engaged</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.729" end="01:02:30.179" style="s2">in its unfolding which side the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.739" end="01:02:32.969" style="s2">side is and so it&#39;s not to say that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.179" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">every interaction between two groups has</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.969" end="01:02:35.880" style="s2">a right side right you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:37.499" style="s2">making that claim of course not but</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.880" end="01:02:38.999" style="s2">there are times when they&#39;re just simply</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.499" end="01:02:40.380" style="s2">the right side and we all know what some</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.999" end="01:02:42.359" style="s2">of them are but the point is what would</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.380" end="01:02:43.709" style="s2">you do you know it&#39;s very easy to look</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.359" end="01:02:45.660" style="s2">at the Nazis and know what the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.709" end="01:02:47.609" style="s2">side of history was one imagines they</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.660" end="01:02:49.559" style="s2">remember the German citizenry right no</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.609" end="01:02:51.239" style="s2">one behaved that way of course but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.559" end="01:02:52.619" style="s2">point is to say look there was a right</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.239" end="01:02:53.910" style="s2">side and it was right then and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.619" end="01:02:56.099" style="s2">right now and it will be right forever</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.910" end="01:02:57.689" style="s2">and so the question is what how do you</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.099" end="01:02:59.429" style="s2">restructure yourself so that when that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.689" end="01:03:00.869" style="s2">moment comes you&#39;ll be on the right side</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.429" end="01:03:02.489" style="s2">that&#39;s a valid question even if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.869" end="01:03:03.929" style="s2">can&#39;t say I&#39;m in possession of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.489" end="01:03:06.329" style="s2">knowledge of which one the right side is</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.929" end="01:03:07.829" style="s2">when something important happens but you</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.329" end="01:03:10.469" style="s2">do want to be on the right side of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.829" end="01:03:13.469" style="s2">history and in this case if you are</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.469" end="01:03:15.329" style="s2">paying attention I believe it is clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.469" end="01:03:18.179" style="s2">which the right side of history is and</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.329" end="01:03:20.549" style="s2">the thing that is so heartbreaking is it</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.179" end="01:03:22.949" style="s2">it is not obvious that&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.549" end="01:03:25.289" style="s2">winning side here that&#39;s the question we</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.949" end="01:03:28.199" style="s2">can ask you join us on the right side of</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.289" end="01:03:29.880" style="s2">history it&#39;s clear enough we cannot say</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.199" end="01:03:31.319" style="s2">join us on the winning side of history</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.880" end="01:03:33.150" style="s2">because frankly the people on the right</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.319" end="01:03:35.699" style="s2">side of history at the moment are pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.150" end="01:03:40.079" style="s2">scared at what they&#39;re seeing so this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.699" end="01:03:42.959" style="s2">a choice for individuals and I can say I</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.079" end="01:03:46.199" style="s2">have no respect for the individual who</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.959" end="01:03:49.049" style="s2">has a choice who has enough security to</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.199" end="01:03:51.390" style="s2">stand up who doesn&#39;t do it that person</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.049" end="01:03:53.849" style="s2">is complicit and they are externalizing</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.390" end="01:03:55.469" style="s2">harm onto innocent other people if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.849" end="01:03:57.239" style="s2">think you&#39;re helping black people by</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.469" end="01:03:59.819" style="s2">shutting down stem you have not</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.239" end="01:04:03.209" style="s2">understood what&#39;s going on science is</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.819" end="01:04:05.579" style="s2">the key to avoiding bias it is the key</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.209" end="01:04:07.380" style="s2">to escaping oppression it is the key to</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.579" end="01:04:07.970" style="s2">discovering what it is about our system</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.380" end="01:04:10.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.970" end="01:04:13.070" style="s2">is systematically biased and eliminating</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.400" end="01:04:15.890" style="s2">it so you are doing black people no</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.070" end="01:04:19.310" style="s2">favor by challenging that mechanism the</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.890" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">question is do you have the intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.310" end="01:04:25.160" style="s2">to see where we are and do you have the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:28.700" style="s2">fortitude to stand up to this nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.160" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">and say no I won&#39;t be party to it and if</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.700" end="01:04:37.970" style="s2">you do then welcome and all I can say is</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:39.170" style="s2">we will do our best to fight to turn the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.970" end="01:04:45.200" style="s2">situation around</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.170" end="01:04:48.920" style="s2">let&#39;s hope we win all right</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.200" end="01:04:50.690" style="s2">the reason we have reached an hour there</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.920" end="01:04:52.160" style="s2">is of course a ton more to say I know</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.690" end="01:04:53.960" style="s2">you had a great deal more that you</p>
