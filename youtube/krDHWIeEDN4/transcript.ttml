<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">familiar with the work of George Lake</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:37.890" style="s2">off he is a linguistics professor at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">University of California in Berkeley and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.890" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">he&#39;s one of the founders of the field of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:45.149" style="s2">cognitive linguistics and this book that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.640" style="s2">I want to review today moral politics</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.149" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">how liberals and conservatives think was</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.640" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">originally published in 1999 this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:55.260" style="s2">second edition that came out in 2003 so</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">more than ten years ago almost 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.260" end="00:01:02.250" style="s2">ago and what george lakoff did in his</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">work is he mapped out the conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:06.299" style="s2">structure of the world views and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">ideology for liberals and conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.299" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">in u.s. politics now how did he do this</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">well you need to know a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">about his background so george lakoff is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">a linguist and he was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">founders of the field of what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">embodied cognition which is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">we understand how the mind works by</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">looking at the structures in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">in our bodies and persistently</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">throughout our social experiences as</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">people with bodies moving around in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">world and now the very structures in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">brains that let us use our bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">exactly the same structures that we use</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">to reason with to feelings about things</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">and to think about things and so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">George Lake off did in the early 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">as a predecessor to this work is he</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">partnered with a philosopher named Mark</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">Johnson and they studied what are called</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">conceptual metaphors oh really briefly</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">the metaphors that we use to reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">about the world are basically the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">process is where we have knowledge from</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">one domain of our experience and we use</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">it to guide our thinking about another</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">domain of our experience and in politics</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">turns out that there&#39;s one very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">important metaphor that george lakoff</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">discovered in has</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:16.590" style="s2">work and that metaphor is the nation as</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:18.540" style="s2">family now this isn&#39;t literally saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.590" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">that we treat nations as they&#39;re as if</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.540" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">there are families it&#39;s more accurate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">say that in our early life experiences</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">we have a number of things that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">directly exposed to in our family</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">environments how there are different</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">kinds of authority different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:34.170" style="s2">learning right from wrong different ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:36.330" style="s2">of establishing social norms and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.170" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">expected behavior and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.330" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">consistent patterns across these</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">experiences or growing up in our family</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:45.410" style="s2">that become foundational inputs for us</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">to understand politics and how to govern</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.410" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">said another way the first times where</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:51.770" style="s2">we have consistent experiences of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">making decisions as a group and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.770" end="00:02:56.340" style="s2">understanding how that happens is in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">homes as children with our families or</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.340" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">in common stories about how families</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">make decisions in popular media within</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">our culture and what george lakoff found</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">was that when he looked at this metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">that the nation is a family then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">start to see a language that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">like we have founding fathers we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">the mothers of the Constitution we send</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:20.340" style="s2">our sons and daughters off to war that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:22.049" style="s2">these phrases only make sense if we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.340" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">conceptualizing the nation as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.049" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">a family and this begs the very</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">important question what kind of family</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">is it and what lake off found when he</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">looked at the language commonly used by</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.070" end="00:03:36.269" style="s2">political conservatives and the language</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">commonly used my political liberals was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.269" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">that there were two coherent what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">might call dynamic attractors or stable</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:46.739" style="s2">ways stable configurations for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">about worldview and ideology morality</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.739" end="00:03:52.350" style="s2">and social behavior and he gave them the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:54.570" style="s2">the names of strict father morality and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.350" end="00:03:55.799" style="s2">nurturing parent morality just turned</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.570" end="00:03:58.680" style="s2">out to be a little confusing because</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.799" end="00:04:00.200" style="s2">people tend to apply gender to it I find</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.680" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">it easier to talk about it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.200" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">authoritarian values that are top-down</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:08.010" style="s2">hierarchies with some moral authority</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:09.510" style="s2">that&#39;s on top that is got submissive</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.010" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">people down below them or subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.510" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">subordinate people down below them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.280" end="00:04:14.600" style="s2">that they learn right from wrong through</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.019" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">discipline punishment and reward</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.600" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">contrast this with the other common way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:22.130" style="s2">of organizing morality which is based in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:24.650" style="s2">empathy compassion</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.130" end="00:04:27.050" style="s2">nerds and in this model of morality</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.650" end="00:04:29.570" style="s2">people learn white right from wrong from</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.050" end="00:04:31.490" style="s2">role modeling basically I will</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:33.320" style="s2">demonstrate good behavior and you will</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.490" end="00:04:35.180" style="s2">learn it through emotional connection to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.320" end="00:04:37.670" style="s2">my behavior in the relationships that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.180" end="00:04:39.200" style="s2">have with you and that the way we learn</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.670" end="00:04:42.050" style="s2">right from wrong is through this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.200" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">molding of social expectations about how</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.050" end="00:04:45.920" style="s2">to treat people how we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:48.050" style="s2">treated and it&#39;s grounded in a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.920" end="00:04:50.750" style="s2">fundamental way and the ability to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.050" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">perspectives and cultivate empathy so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.750" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">what he found was that when we apply</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:56.120" style="s2">these two different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">understanding morality to families and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.120" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">governing decisions they explain a great</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:03.830" style="s2">deal about politics in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:06.200" style="s2">so specifically people who tend to vote</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:10.030" style="s2">conservative or for Republicans will</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.200" end="00:05:12.920" style="s2">often have this authoritarian top-down</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.030" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">discipline-based reward and Punishment</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.920" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">world view whereas people who tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.780" end="00:05:20.110" style="s2">more liberal or progressive will have</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:22.520" style="s2">more of a nurturer and empathy based</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.110" end="00:05:25.370" style="s2">egalitarian worldview what everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.520" end="00:05:27.590" style="s2">worthy of basic rights where we should</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.370" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">care about the suffering that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.590" end="00:05:31.550" style="s2">other people that all people are created</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:33.410" style="s2">equal and you can see that even in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.550" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">founding documents of our Constitution</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.410" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">and our Declaration of Independence</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.630" style="s2">you&#39;ll actually find both of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.090" style="s2">worldviews and conflict with each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.630" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">so the long history of politics in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.090" end="00:05:45.820" style="s2">United States is an ideological struggle</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:49.480" style="s2">between different ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.820" end="00:05:51.590" style="s2">how we should govern and this book</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.480" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">systematically explores these two</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.590" end="00:05:54.590" style="s2">worldviews and how there are many</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.590" end="00:05:58.040" style="s2">appear to explain the way that</p>
