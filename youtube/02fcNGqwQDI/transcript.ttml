<p begin="00:01:06.110" end="00:01:08.510" style="s2">cuteness</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.530" end="00:01:12.320" style="s2">we called it let us maybe get triggered</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.510" end="00:01:13.520" style="s2">by Jordan Pederson symposium so for</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.320" end="00:01:15.020" style="s2">those of you who are new at the store</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.520" end="00:01:17.420" style="s2">because we have about seventy people</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.770" end="00:01:22.190" style="s2">full disclosure Jordan Peterson was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.180" end="00:01:26.180" style="s2">therapist for two years before he became</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.190" end="00:01:27.530" style="s2">a superstar famous superstar so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.180" end="00:01:30.230" style="s2">great love for him but this does not</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.530" end="00:01:32.510" style="s2">mean I agree with everything he said it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.230" end="00:01:34.430" style="s2">says it&#39;s needless to say but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.510" end="00:01:35.750" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to have more important</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.430" end="00:01:38.360" style="s2">and interesting to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.750" end="00:01:40.640" style="s2">about some of the ideas he&#39;s presented</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.360" end="00:01:42.590" style="s2">and I was talking to Raven it feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.640" end="00:01:45.380" style="s2">tone-deaf having this with all these</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.590" end="00:01:47.000" style="s2">riots going on in America but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.380" end="00:01:49.060" style="s2">this has been booked before what was</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.000" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">happening some sensitive to that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.060" end="00:01:54.680" style="s2">mindful of it as well and so Raven is</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.290" end="00:02:53.719" style="s2">the symposium to draw in the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:56.329" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.719" end="00:02:59.510" style="s2">Enchantment as it relates to the current</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.329" end="00:03:02.029" style="s2">political and spiritual crises that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.510" end="00:03:04.430" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing right now on the streets of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.029" end="00:03:06.379" style="s2">America and so I feel like deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.430" end="00:03:08.569" style="s2">honored and and grateful that we made</p>

<p begin="00:03:08.569" end="00:03:14.329" style="s2">come on today and talk about the theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.689" end="00:03:16.040" style="s2">of Enchantment and how it relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.329" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">current crises that we have going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.040" end="00:03:19.819" style="s2">right now so thank you so much Chloe for</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">being here</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.150" end="00:03:36.109" style="s2">name is Chloe Valerie I am 26 years old</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.840" end="00:03:38.569" style="s2">I created a startup called theory of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.109" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">Enchantment roughly a year ago and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.569" end="00:03:43.400" style="s2">purpose of the startup is really to</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:46.730" style="s2">teach people how to build character and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.400" end="00:03:49.809" style="s2">to develop character amidst the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.730" end="00:03:54.230" style="s2">and complexity of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.809" end="00:03:56.269" style="s2">so can we I wanted to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.230" end="00:03:59.419" style="s2">three main principles of the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.269" end="00:04:01.579" style="s2">Enchantment and relate those to what</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.419" end="00:04:05.150" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing right now on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.579" end="00:04:07.969" style="s2">of our country so the first one if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.150" end="00:04:11.650" style="s2">don&#39;t mind if I read it sure we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.969" end="00:04:15.889" style="s2">human beings not political abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.650" end="00:04:17.209" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a big one there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.889" end="00:04:18.530" style="s2">and I tweeted about this this morning</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.209" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.530" end="00:04:22.490" style="s2">principle cuz it&#39;s foundational and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:25.100" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand this and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.490" end="00:04:27.260" style="s2">don&#39;t internalize this and really Center</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.100" end="00:04:29.389" style="s2">this principle in their activism and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.260" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">their understanding about how to sustain</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.389" end="00:04:34.849" style="s2">democracy then there will be challenges</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:35.900" style="s2">and there will be a great deal of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.849" end="00:04:38.599" style="s2">trouble and I think we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.900" end="00:04:41.570" style="s2">right now with regard to some of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.599" end="00:04:45.460" style="s2">who have hijacked a lot of the protests</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.570" end="00:04:49.060" style="s2">within the streets of America people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.460" end="00:04:52.460" style="s2">unfortunately some people are you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.060" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">adopting very dehumanizing language in</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.460" end="00:04:55.970" style="s2">the way that they&#39;re protesting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:58.010" style="s2">saying you know F white people at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.970" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">police and so they&#39;re weather</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.010" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">essentially doing is they are reducing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:04.220" style="s2">individuals human beings to certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:05.990" style="s2">abstractions whether that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.220" end="00:05:09.230" style="s2">abstraction based on race whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.990" end="00:05:12.500" style="s2">an abstraction based upon a uniform that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.230" end="00:05:14.990" style="s2">a man or woman wears and as a result</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.500" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">they are obscuring the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.990" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">people are human beings who are and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:19.850" style="s2">you know we asked a question in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:21.230" style="s2">course in the theory of a time of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.850" end="00:05:23.480" style="s2">what does it actually mean to be human</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.230" end="00:05:24.920" style="s2">it means that you are imperfect it means</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.480" end="00:05:26.330" style="s2">that you are flawed it means that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.920" end="00:05:28.460" style="s2">are multi-dimensional which means you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.330" end="00:05:31.220" style="s2">have the capacity to do good and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.460" end="00:05:34.250" style="s2">capacity to do evil and this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.220" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">exists within every single one of us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.250" end="00:05:40.160" style="s2">so if one is not cognizant of this one</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2">can lose themselves in their activism</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:46.460" style="s2">one can end up becoming the very thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.650" end="00:05:49.190" style="s2">that they seek to to overcome and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.460" end="00:05:50.810" style="s2">is really an inflection point in our</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.190" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">country&#39;s history and a moment where we</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.810" end="00:05:56.750" style="s2">have to make sure that we don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:58.640" style="s2">and we don&#39;t fall into the nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.750" end="00:06:01.190" style="s2">chaos of saying you know well</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.640" end="00:06:03.170" style="s2">everything&#39;s hopeless anyway and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.190" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">never gonna change anything so we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.170" end="00:06:06.260" style="s2">say screw it and tear it all down</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:09.500" style="s2">because the fact of the matter is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.260" end="00:06:11.900" style="s2">what it also means to be human is to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.500" end="00:06:13.850" style="s2">able to rise above your circumstances is</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.900" end="00:06:16.390" style="s2">to be able to maximize your full</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.850" end="00:06:19.670" style="s2">potential and it&#39;s to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.390" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">the necessary emotional and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.670" end="00:06:24.260" style="s2">maturity to overcome seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:26.840" style="s2">insurmountable odds that&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.260" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">makes being human special and the human</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.840" end="00:06:30.320" style="s2">condition is special so it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">important that people understand that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.320" end="00:06:37.160" style="s2">first place you go absolutely the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:41.510" style="s2">principle criticized to uplift and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.160" end="00:06:45.020" style="s2">empower never to tear down or destroy so</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.510" end="00:06:49.970" style="s2">yes obviously also this is a very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.020" end="00:06:53.570" style="s2">very very appropriate principle for</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.970" end="00:06:55.340" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.570" end="00:06:59.060" style="s2">it&#39;s for both</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.340" end="00:07:01.669" style="s2">a person being criticized and also the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.060" end="00:07:03.560" style="s2">person doing the creek or doling out the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.669" end="00:07:07.040" style="s2">criticism and this this was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.560" end="00:07:07.790" style="s2">relates to my understanding of of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.040" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">way the world works</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.790" end="00:07:11.419" style="s2">I should back up for a bit I should say</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:13.820" style="s2">the theory of Enchantment the uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.419" end="00:07:15.650" style="s2">of it is that I use both the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.820" end="00:07:18.139" style="s2">developmental psychology and pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.650" end="00:07:19.790" style="s2">to teach it and I think this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.139" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">sort of overlapped with a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.790" end="00:07:23.389" style="s2">Jordan Peterson does because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:26.120" style="s2">you know in maps of meaning for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.389" end="00:07:29.690" style="s2">he brings in Pinocchio and he brings in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.120" end="00:07:32.930" style="s2">many of the great myths of cultures from</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.690" end="00:07:34.850" style="s2">all around the world to really create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.930" end="00:07:36.590" style="s2">framework an ethical framework and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.850" end="00:07:37.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what I tried to do as well and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.590" end="00:07:41.210" style="s2">the second principle is very much</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.910" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">related to my belief in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:46.310" style="s2">the central teaching in the Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:48.380" style="s2">which is about the circle of life which</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.310" end="00:07:50.330" style="s2">is about how we are interconnected to</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:54.590" style="s2">each other which is about how if I do</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.330" end="00:07:56.930" style="s2">something wrong it doesn&#39;t only affect</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.590" end="00:08:00.620" style="s2">you it affects the people that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.930" end="00:08:03.139" style="s2">effect it affects tenfold beyond myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.620" end="00:08:07.010" style="s2">and so the second principle is not just</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.139" end="00:08:09.620" style="s2">about rooting our intentions in a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.010" end="00:08:10.820" style="s2">place when we criticize others because</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.620" end="00:08:13.010" style="s2">that&#39;s important and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.820" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">morally sound position but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.010" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">about the fact that if you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:21.020" style="s2">you actually end up compounding the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:23.000" style="s2">situation right so if you see someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.020" end="00:08:25.190" style="s2">engaging in bad behavior right this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.000" end="00:08:27.710" style="s2">perfect perfect example for our current</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.190" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">time if you see a police in uniform</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.710" end="00:08:33.380" style="s2">engaging in bad behavior first of all</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">you know nothing about the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.380" end="00:08:39.320" style="s2">the uniform you don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:42.110" style="s2">person was in war at one point and had</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.320" end="00:08:44.209" style="s2">PTSD and had unhealed PTSD and is now in</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.110" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">the police force right you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.209" end="00:08:47.240" style="s2">anything about the background of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:48.830" style="s2">person you don&#39;t know anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.240" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">baggage of this person you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.830" end="00:08:52.640" style="s2">anything about the wait so that this</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:54.830" style="s2">person is carrying the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.640" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">you know about this person is the moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.830" end="00:08:59.690" style="s2">that you are experiencing with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">person and so if you see or if you hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.690" end="00:09:07.880" style="s2">of someone engaging in in unjust actions</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:09.080" style="s2">what you should not do is criticize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.880" end="00:09:11.210" style="s2">person in such</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.080" end="00:09:13.430" style="s2">way that tears them down you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.210" end="00:09:16.730" style="s2">make sure or your criticism is rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.430" end="00:09:19.220" style="s2">a way that lifts and uplifts everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.730" end="00:09:20.840" style="s2">involved and this is something that dr.</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.220" end="00:09:22.850" style="s2">King taught you know obviously in his</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.840" end="00:09:25.700" style="s2">ideas about how to create the Beloved</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.850" end="00:09:27.650" style="s2">Community um but what you end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.700" end="00:09:29.390" style="s2">if you don&#39;t do this if you compile the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.650" end="00:09:32.120" style="s2">situation because if you tell someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.390" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">and Maya Angelou talked about this if</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.120" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">you tell someone they&#39;re nothing over</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:39.410" style="s2">and over again they will say to you oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:41.150" style="s2">you think I am nothing I will show you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.410" end="00:09:43.610" style="s2">where nothing is and then they will</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.150" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">become even worse than what you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.610" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">accused them of being and the moral of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.740" end="00:09:50.570" style="s2">the story is that a person cannot</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:52.460" style="s2">develop character unless they are valued</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.570" end="00:09:55.790" style="s2">and this seems counterintuitive because</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.460" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">if someone is acting incorrectly toward</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.790" end="00:10:02.030" style="s2">you personally it&#39;s very hard to say to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:03.530" style="s2">yourself oh I&#39;m gonna criticize you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.030" end="00:10:06.260" style="s2">I&#39;m going to correct you not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.530" end="00:10:07.940" style="s2">because what you are doing is unjust but</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.260" end="00:10:10.580" style="s2">I&#39;m also going to correct you because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.940" end="00:10:12.860" style="s2">care about you I&#39;m also going to correct</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.580" end="00:10:14.870" style="s2">you because I know that you have more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.860" end="00:10:17.540" style="s2">potential than what you are doing right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:19.700" style="s2">now I&#39;m going to speak to that potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.540" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to speak to your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.700" end="00:10:24.890" style="s2">to rise to your higher self it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.490" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">difficult to do that which really I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.890" end="00:10:31.870" style="s2">think sort of illustrates how truly</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:35.660" style="s2">radical the civil rights movement was</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.870" end="00:10:38.090" style="s2">because as a reminder people during the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.660" end="00:10:41.710" style="s2">civil rights movement literally studied</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.090" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">stoicism right and trained themselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.710" end="00:10:48.740" style="s2">not to fight back when desegregating</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:51.410" style="s2">diners and the purpose of this was to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.740" end="00:10:54.650" style="s2">fold some of strategic perspectives if</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.410" end="00:10:57.460" style="s2">the state is using repressive force</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.650" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">against you and it creates an image of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.460" end="00:11:04.070" style="s2">violent state versus nonviolent peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:05.990" style="s2">protesters about the the the scales in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.070" end="00:11:07.850" style="s2">terms of moving public opinion towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.990" end="00:11:09.380" style="s2">civil rights tips in your favor as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.850" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">nonviolent protest that&#39;s number one</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.380" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">remember - from a spiritual perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:16.400" style="s2">and from a moral perspective the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:20.120" style="s2">was we are going to embody the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.400" end="00:11:22.710" style="s2">principles we seek to facilitate in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:25.560" style="s2">society so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.710" end="00:11:28.440" style="s2">cannot drag down another human being</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.560" end="00:11:31.080" style="s2">even as we are criticizing their wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.440" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">behavior and we recognize that if a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.080" end="00:11:36.680" style="s2">person is caught up and engaged in wrong</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:39.990" style="s2">behavior they are also trapped in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.680" end="00:11:41.580" style="s2">wrong behavior so we speak to the again</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.990" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">the possibility of human beings and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.580" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">is the nature of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:48.030" style="s2">to rise above not only other situations</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:49.080" style="s2">but to rise above the immoral behavior</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.030" end="00:11:51.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.080" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">at the present moment so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.000" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">the the the idea behind the second</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:12:01.740" style="s2">principle and the third principle lead</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:03.630" style="s2">with love and compassion yes so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.740" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">sort of the culmination of the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.630" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">Enchantment very much like the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:12.630" style="s2">principle inspired by dr. King and dr.</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:15.780" style="s2">King&#39;s philosophy of agape love and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.630" end="00:12:19.590" style="s2">using agape love which is a concept that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.780" end="00:12:21.690" style="s2">originates from Christianity and really</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.590" end="00:12:23.790" style="s2">is all about this idea that you love a</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.690" end="00:12:25.890" style="s2">person simply because they were made in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.790" end="00:12:27.480" style="s2">the image of God and you love a person</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.890" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">simply because they are a human being</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.480" end="00:12:31.980" style="s2">you do not love a person because of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:33.330" style="s2">their behavior you do not love a person</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.980" end="00:12:35.910" style="s2">because you agree with every single</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.330" end="00:12:37.490" style="s2">thing that they do but be cut but</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.910" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">because simply there are human being and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.490" end="00:12:42.150" style="s2">and by rooting everything you do in love</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.640" style="s2">and compassion again you embody the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.150" end="00:12:47.250" style="s2">values that you wish to see perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.640" end="00:12:50.640" style="s2">in society and one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.250" end="00:12:54.660" style="s2">love to teach or to use as a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.640" end="00:12:56.930" style="s2">teaching this particular concept in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.660" end="00:13:00.330" style="s2">theory of entrapment sort of lexicon is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.930" end="00:13:03.420" style="s2">a pop culture favorite of mine which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.330" end="00:13:05.880" style="s2">the story of Moana so mallanna is one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.420" end="00:13:08.130" style="s2">the great I personally think it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.880" end="00:13:10.860" style="s2">the greatest Disney movies certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.130" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">contemporary times ever made but</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.860" end="00:13:14.940" style="s2">mallanna is and for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:16.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it I&#39;m gonna talk to you a</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.940" end="00:13:18.360" style="s2">little bit about it but so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.680" end="00:13:21.060" style="s2">spoiler alert be still watch it because</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.360" end="00:13:22.770" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing show but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.060" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">brilliant about Moana is that Moana</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.770" end="00:13:27.720" style="s2">differs from many of the other Disney</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.700" style="s2">heroes so a lot of the Disney heroes go</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.720" end="00:13:32.040" style="s2">through the classic hero&#39;s journey that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.700" end="00:13:33.930" style="s2">folks like Jordan Peterson described in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.040" end="00:13:35.490" style="s2">maps of meaning so the hero has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.930" end="00:13:36.540" style="s2">encounter a bunch of obstacles and this</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.490" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">transformed</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.540" end="00:13:41.060" style="s2">by the encountering of that obstacle and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.230" style="s2">the hero sort of has flaws also</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.060" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">obviously and have to transcend those</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.230" end="00:13:48.420" style="s2">flaws but mallanna is a very different</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:50.310" style="s2">kind of hero mallanna is simply a healer</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.420" end="00:13:52.830" style="s2">she&#39;s literally from the time she is</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.310" end="00:13:55.890" style="s2">born she was put on earth to heal that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.830" end="00:13:57.950" style="s2">is her that is her life&#39;s purpose and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.890" end="00:14:01.320" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna explain the context a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.950" end="00:14:04.980" style="s2">for you and I promise I will draw I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.320" end="00:14:09.780" style="s2">draw this to something that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.980" end="00:14:12.090" style="s2">in real life so Moana the the story goes</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.780" end="00:14:14.760" style="s2">that mallanna is on an island and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.090" end="00:14:17.850" style="s2">island is dying and the reason why the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.760" end="00:14:21.450" style="s2">island is dying is because there was a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.850" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">goddess ruled over this island named to</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.450" end="00:14:27.030" style="s2">Fiji and to Fiji was green and lush and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.930" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">made everything beautiful everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.030" end="00:14:33.660" style="s2">flourished but then the heart was taken</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:37.230" style="s2">from Tahiti and in her place arose a new</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.660" end="00:14:41.220" style="s2">goddess named touka and sakal was full</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.230" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">of lava and fury and rage and some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.220" end="00:14:46.830" style="s2">the impulses that were witnessing right</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:50.340" style="s2">now in the streets of america and so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.830" end="00:14:54.540" style="s2">the goal the objective of mallanna is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.340" end="00:14:56.370" style="s2">restore the heart of to Fiji to defeat</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.540" end="00:14:58.650" style="s2">to come restore the heart look to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.370" end="00:15:01.200" style="s2">about that is what the film is about now</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.650" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">at the very end and again you should</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.200" end="00:15:06.270" style="s2">still watch it at the very end when</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:10.200" style="s2">mallanna confronts touka</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.270" end="00:15:13.140" style="s2">again imagine it&#39;s this lava rageful</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.200" end="00:15:15.120" style="s2">goddess just destroying everything right</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.140" end="00:15:18.570" style="s2">cuz the island she&#39;s making the island</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:23.010" style="s2">die so she&#39;s holding a heart of to fiji</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.570" end="00:15:25.380" style="s2">in her hand and she looks at the car and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.010" end="00:15:28.530" style="s2">she has his aha moment that she hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.380" end="00:15:30.990" style="s2">had in the rest of the film and in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.530" end="00:15:33.810" style="s2">movie the water sort of alive and her</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.990" end="00:15:36.330" style="s2">her friend or whatever and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.810" end="00:15:38.760" style="s2">body of water separating Takei I&#39;m Ilana</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.330" end="00:15:41.520" style="s2">I&#39;m Alana tells the water let her come</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.760" end="00:15:44.550" style="s2">to me and so the water disperses very</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.520" end="00:15:47.550" style="s2">much like a like a Moses moment and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.550" end="00:15:48.650" style="s2">Takei starts to come again full of rage</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.550" end="00:15:50.400" style="s2">full of fury</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.650" end="00:15:54.210" style="s2">Malala starts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.400" end="00:15:55.410" style="s2">talk to her very very calm like a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.210" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">too calm considering the situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.410" end="00:16:01.410" style="s2">they&#39;re very calm and she says to her a</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.250" end="00:16:04.410" style="s2">very simple thing she says I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.410" end="00:16:07.650" style="s2">crossed the horizon to find you I know</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.410" end="00:16:11.610" style="s2">your name they have stolen the heart</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.650" end="00:16:17.760" style="s2">from inside you but this does not define</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.610" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">you and the aha moment that she has when</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.760" end="00:16:22.920" style="s2">she says this and all of a sudden two</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:25.350" style="s2">consoles like stops the aha moment that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.920" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2">she has was that the car and so fitti</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.350" end="00:16:32.610" style="s2">were the same exact being so when the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">heart was removed from two feet he/she</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.610" end="00:16:41.340" style="s2">descended into rage and into destruction</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:44.490" style="s2">and truck and started destroying</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.340" end="00:16:47.280" style="s2">everything mana is a is a commentary on</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.490" end="00:16:50.460" style="s2">the on the need for spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.280" end="00:16:54.840" style="s2">nourishment within human beings and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.460" end="00:16:57.360" style="s2">once mallanna returned the heart to Kyle</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.840" end="00:16:59.100" style="s2">once more became to Fiji again and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.360" end="00:17:00.690" style="s2">relates to the first principle right we</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.100" end="00:17:02.490" style="s2">had the capacity to do good we have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.690" end="00:17:04.950" style="s2">capacity to do evil it was the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.490" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">exact me the same exact thing but to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.950" end="00:17:10.830" style="s2">Copic bTW because the heart was removed</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">and obviously the heart is a motif for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.830" end="00:17:16.230" style="s2">love and compassion because the heart</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:17.220" style="s2">was removed she descended into rage and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.230" end="00:17:20.250" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing right</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.220" end="00:17:22.320" style="s2">now I&#39;m in this country there is a lack</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.250" end="00:17:26.070" style="s2">of spiritual ratification there&#39;s a lack</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.320" end="00:17:27.900" style="s2">of basic this is a basic idea of love</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.070" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">and compassion for your fellow neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.900" end="00:17:31.950" style="s2">when it acts well then if you&#39;re a cop</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.950" style="s2">or that&#39;s the peak of the community that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.950" end="00:17:37.170" style="s2">you&#39;re policing but if you&#39;re a citizen</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.950" end="00:17:39.000" style="s2">that&#39;s for all the people in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.170" end="00:17:40.530" style="s2">neighborhood including the cops that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.000" end="00:17:43.650" style="s2">policing your neighborhood there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.530" end="00:17:46.590" style="s2">lack of love and compassion and we are</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.650" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">seeing the negative effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.590" end="00:17:50.550" style="s2">right now I&#39;m going to tell you one more</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:52.380" style="s2">story sort of round this out about love</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.550" end="00:17:55.500" style="s2">and compassion at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.380" end="00:17:58.260" style="s2">Florida a few years ago there was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.500" end="00:18:01.560" style="s2">neo-nazi that came to speak and there</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.260" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">was a protest that ensued outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.560" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">room no there was a God</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:11.700" style="s2">named cuz I&#39;m was front Randy furnace</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.990" end="00:18:13.860" style="s2">Randy furnace at the time identified as</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.700" end="00:18:16.770" style="s2">a neo-nazi he had Nazi signs all over</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.860" end="00:18:19.050" style="s2">his t-shirt it was no you know guess who</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.770" end="00:18:21.300" style="s2">he was there to see but in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.050" end="00:18:23.730" style="s2">to don&#39;t see this person you had to walk</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.300" end="00:18:25.950" style="s2">through the sea of protesters right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.730" end="00:18:28.830" style="s2">when he got to the sea of protesters</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.950" end="00:18:31.620" style="s2">some of them started pushing him shoving</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.830" end="00:18:32.790" style="s2">him spitting on him cursing him out</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.620" end="00:18:37.880" style="s2">one person punched him in the face</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.790" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">causing blood to draw until another man</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.880" end="00:18:45.270" style="s2">african-american man sees Randy furnace</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:47.270" style="s2">and has no idea what to do he&#39;s seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.270" end="00:18:49.560" style="s2">for the first time someone who hates him</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.270" end="00:18:51.450" style="s2">because of his skin color has no idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.560" end="00:18:54.660" style="s2">what to do and so for some reason in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.450" end="00:18:56.610" style="s2">that move in that moment he does the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.660" end="00:19:00.060" style="s2">only thing he&#39;s moved to do which is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.610" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">say that he hugs him and he pulls him</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.060" end="00:19:04.560" style="s2">close and he asked him the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:05.310" style="s2">three times why do you hate me why do</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.560" end="00:19:07.680" style="s2">you hate me</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.310" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">why do you hate me and at this point</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.680" end="00:19:11.040" style="s2">ready furnace doesn&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:13.140" style="s2">because the object of his hatred is now</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.040" end="00:19:16.140" style="s2">hugging him it&#39;s not exactly what he</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.140" end="00:19:17.730" style="s2">expected and so in that moment he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.140" end="00:19:20.730" style="s2">he&#39;s moved to do the thing that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.730" end="00:19:23.310" style="s2">him which is to say he hugs him back and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.730" end="00:19:27.150" style="s2">he simply responds by saying I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.310" end="00:19:29.670" style="s2">know in this exchange sparks a series of</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.150" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">conversations between between Randy</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.670" end="00:19:33.780" style="s2">furnace and the other guy&#39;s name is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:36.120" style="s2">Aaron Courtney and other members of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.780" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">african-american community and Randy</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.120" end="00:19:41.040" style="s2">furnace has since disavowed his ties to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">neo-nazi movement now what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.040" end="00:19:46.620" style="s2">about this is if you were to look into</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:49.500" style="s2">randy furnaces background you would</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.620" end="00:19:52.440" style="s2">learn that he was suicidal in his</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.500" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">twenties early 20s and from from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.440" end="00:19:56.100" style="s2">perspective from where i&#39;m standing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:20:01.710" style="s2">makes perfect sense because if your</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.100" end="00:20:04.950" style="s2">sense of self-worth is so empty that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.710" end="00:20:05.910" style="s2">are willing to kill yourself or attempt</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.950" end="00:20:08.910" style="s2">to kill yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.910" end="00:20:10.200" style="s2">then you can be easily exploited by</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.910" end="00:20:12.840" style="s2">other groups that are going to give you</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.200" end="00:20:15.990" style="s2">a cause with which you can derive</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.840" end="00:20:17.789" style="s2">meaning from right and so I tell you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.990" end="00:20:18.929" style="s2">that story because</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.789" end="00:20:20.609" style="s2">and Courtney Lee with love and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.929" end="00:20:23.519" style="s2">compassion instead of the the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.609" end="00:20:26.460" style="s2">impulse that the crowd led with and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.519" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">was almost as if when Aaron saw him it</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.460" end="00:20:31.919" style="s2">was almost as if he had a similar moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:34.139" style="s2">that mallanna had it was almost as if he</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:36.869" style="s2">said to him I have crossed the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.139" end="00:20:39.389" style="s2">to find you I know your name they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.869" end="00:20:42.029" style="s2">stolen the heart from inside you but</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.389" end="00:20:44.700" style="s2">this does not define you so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.029" end="00:20:47.009" style="s2">somehow find a way it&#39;s a central love</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.700" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">and compassion in our discourse to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.009" end="00:20:52.349" style="s2">Center in the in the protests that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:55.139" style="s2">seeing it has to be holistic it has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.349" end="00:20:58.289" style="s2">spread it has to be universal it has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.139" end="00:20:59.669" style="s2">be love for the black community and love</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.289" end="00:21:02.009" style="s2">for the white community it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.669" end="00:21:04.349" style="s2">love for citizens and love for police</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.009" end="00:21:08.419" style="s2">officers it has to be holistic it has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.349" end="00:21:08.419" style="s2">be consistent otherwise it will not work</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.359" end="00:21:17.489" style="s2">so I want to invite people to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.129" end="00:21:19.590" style="s2">put their questions in the chat so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.489" end="00:21:22.679" style="s2">you just type it out and then I&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.590" end="00:21:24.659" style="s2">on you to ask your question to Chloe so</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.679" end="00:21:26.009" style="s2">Chloe you&#39;ve already told a few stories</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.659" end="00:21:30.539" style="s2">that I feel like have a lot of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.009" end="00:21:31.830" style="s2">for the current moment but are there</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.539" end="00:21:34.799" style="s2">other stories that you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.830" end="00:21:36.809" style="s2">maybe talk about the Pinocchio story or</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.799" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">stories that you learn from from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.809" end="00:21:41.580" style="s2">Peterson or maps of meaning that have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.820" end="00:21:44.759" style="s2">some salient truths that can lead us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.580" end="00:21:47.029" style="s2">a path of redemption or hope for</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.759" end="00:21:49.289" style="s2">transcendence of this current moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.029" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question so actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.289" end="00:21:58.919" style="s2">a couple months ago when Kovac started</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:22:01.649" style="s2">happening I watched maps of meaning 2017</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.919" end="00:22:05.909" style="s2">version and I&#39;m actually reading Matson</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.649" end="00:22:08.309" style="s2">meaning now which is something so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.909" end="00:22:10.049" style="s2">definitely a tour de force in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.309" end="00:22:12.259" style="s2">stories that that Jordan Peterson has</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.049" end="00:22:14.789" style="s2">told that really resonate with me I</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.259" end="00:22:17.309" style="s2">think yeah when he broke down Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.789" end="00:22:20.340" style="s2">you know I watched Pinocchio first and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.309" end="00:22:21.509" style="s2">then I watched his analysis and it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.340" end="00:22:23.700" style="s2">crazy to me because the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.509" end="00:22:25.320" style="s2">stands out about Pinocchio that most</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.700" end="00:22:27.210" style="s2">people know what Pinocchio for is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.320" end="00:22:29.519" style="s2">fact that when he lies his nose extends</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.210" end="00:22:31.530" style="s2">right which is like the least important</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.519" end="00:22:35.070" style="s2">and least interesting ass</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.530" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">facts of Pinocchio one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.070" end="00:22:41.580" style="s2">that really stuck out to me was Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.980" end="00:22:43.730" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s explanation of when Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.580" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">was carted off to Pleasure Island</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.730" end="00:22:48.030" style="s2">because I think we&#39;re seeing parallels</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:50.100" style="s2">of that with regard to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.030" end="00:22:51.630" style="s2">hijackers of the protest when when</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.100" end="00:22:54.620" style="s2">Pinocchio was carted off to Pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.630" end="00:22:57.900" style="s2">Island and was encouraged by the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.620" end="00:23:01.410" style="s2">stagecoach to basically weak havoc to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.900" end="00:23:04.260" style="s2">destroy they were him and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.410" end="00:23:06.810" style="s2">other boys were encouraged to destroy a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.260" end="00:23:08.570" style="s2">home to just throw bricks into the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.810" end="00:23:11.160" style="s2">like crazy how much of a one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.570" end="00:23:16.680" style="s2">correlation there is here but they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.160" end="00:23:19.260" style="s2">encouraged to just just sort of evolved</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.680" end="00:23:20.850" style="s2">into nihilistic frenzy and destroy</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.260" end="00:23:22.380" style="s2">everything because nothing mad is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.850" end="00:23:24.420" style="s2">only thing that matters is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.380" end="00:23:26.160" style="s2">immediate the only thing that matters is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.420" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">your feeling of pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.160" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">right in this moment right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:33.060" style="s2">why it&#39;s called Pleasure Island but of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">course it was all a con because the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.060" end="00:23:38.430" style="s2">stagecoach was involved in a sinister</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:42.060" style="s2">plot - slowly but surely change these</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.430" end="00:23:45.090" style="s2">young boys into literal donkeys and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.060" end="00:23:47.700" style="s2">cart them off into slavery and it is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.090" end="00:23:50.940" style="s2">incredible metaphor for what happens</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.700" end="00:23:53.220" style="s2">when we lose ourselves so the base</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.940" end="00:23:55.410" style="s2">instincts that we have within us because</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.220" end="00:23:59.100" style="s2">we do have have those impulses within us</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.410" end="00:24:04.410" style="s2">when we lose ourselves and when we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.100" end="00:24:06.660" style="s2">not capable of controlling ourselves we</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.410" end="00:24:09.720" style="s2">turn into slaves essentially and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.660" end="00:24:11.400" style="s2">ironic because this is this is a you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.720" end="00:24:14.910" style="s2">know we&#39;re talking about right now in</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.400" end="00:24:17.670" style="s2">the country a cause that is first and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.910" end="00:24:20.160" style="s2">foremost trying to advance principles of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.670" end="00:24:23.490" style="s2">Liberty right how do we bring about</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.160" end="00:24:26.850" style="s2">justice and police forces how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.490" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">ensure that police officers understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.850" end="00:24:34.380" style="s2">that the the demand to protect and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.200" end="00:24:37.350" style="s2">serve applies not only to would-be</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.380" end="00:24:40.110" style="s2">victims but also the criminals that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.350" end="00:24:41.820" style="s2">have in your in York they are under your</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.110" end="00:24:44.460" style="s2">concern they&#39;re under your jurisdiction</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.820" end="00:24:45.090" style="s2">the moment you arrest them you also have</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.460" end="00:24:47.820" style="s2">an obligate</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.090" end="00:24:50.220" style="s2">to protect and serve them as well even</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.820" end="00:24:52.860" style="s2">though you obviously have to do your</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.220" end="00:24:55.889" style="s2">duty and get them into into a specific</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.860" end="00:24:57.720" style="s2">place and so this question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.889" end="00:24:59.820" style="s2">pursue justice how do we actually create</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.720" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">a society that is rooted in Liberty and</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.820" end="00:25:04.289" style="s2">yet we have people who are descending</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:07.830" style="s2">into madness and descending into</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.289" end="00:25:10.769" style="s2">lawlessness and becoming slaves to their</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">own passions and becoming slaves to this</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.769" end="00:25:16.340" style="s2">impulse and this instinct to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:19.409" style="s2">nihilistic so that&#39;s a philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.340" end="00:25:22.289" style="s2">inconsistent and morally inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.409" end="00:25:25.139" style="s2">way to bring about justice and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.289" end="00:25:28.200" style="s2">that the Pinocchio story um really</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.139" end="00:25:30.570" style="s2">really sort of promotes that and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.200" end="00:25:32.700" style="s2">idea and really shows that idea but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.570" end="00:25:34.350" style="s2">other thing that it shows and and this</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.700" end="00:25:36.840" style="s2">is also true I think of Sleeping Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.350" end="00:25:42.749" style="s2">which I also rewatched recently is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.840" end="00:25:46.740" style="s2">the hero has to make sacrifices and is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.749" end="00:25:50.429" style="s2">hero&#39;s job to basically look chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.740" end="00:25:52.139" style="s2">the eye and create order out of it and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.429" end="00:25:56.029" style="s2">think that this is also the artists task</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.139" end="00:25:58.499" style="s2">right it&#39;s to create meaning out of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.029" end="00:26:00.659" style="s2">destruction and chaos and malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.499" end="00:26:02.249" style="s2">that is the Bettis the job of the artist</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.659" end="00:26:05.460" style="s2">that it&#39;s the job of the hero that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.249" end="00:26:07.110" style="s2">the job of the leader I&#39;m I wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.460" end="00:26:09.960" style="s2">newsletter or I published a newsletter</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.110" end="00:26:12.509" style="s2">today that release was studying the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.960" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">movie Black Panther actually because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.509" end="00:26:17.190" style="s2">think I think Black Panther has</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:20.419" style="s2">incredible wisdom for this moment right</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.190" end="00:26:23.909" style="s2">now in our in our country because it</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.419" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">juxtaposes two different sets of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.909" end="00:26:29.879" style="s2">principles within the characters of King</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:32.730" style="s2">T&#39;Challa and kill monger kill monger is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.879" end="00:26:36.299" style="s2">killer was abandoned he&#39;s the villain he</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.730" end="00:26:38.399" style="s2">was abandoned he was left to rot he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.299" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">neglected and so what happens he</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.399" end="00:26:42.570" style="s2">internalizes that sense of abandonment</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:45.029" style="s2">he internalizes that sense of neglect</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.570" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">and he rages and he becomes destructive</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.029" end="00:26:51.169" style="s2">and he becomes homicidal and suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:53.879" style="s2">you know he destroys everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.169" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">everything that comes before him even</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.879" end="00:26:58.740" style="s2">from his ancestors right and T&#39;Challa</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:02.250" style="s2">was the king</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.740" end="00:27:05.040" style="s2">the rightful king has to say to his</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.250" end="00:27:07.470" style="s2">father what you did when you abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.040" end="00:27:11.070" style="s2">him was was horrible like you this is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.470" end="00:27:13.650" style="s2">monster of our own creation right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.070" end="00:27:15.510" style="s2">sorry acknowledges the rage that kill</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.650" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">monger halves and acknowledges the sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.510" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">of despair that he has but it also says</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:23.940" style="s2">but this is not the way this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.400" style="s2">way if you have malice in your heart and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.940" end="00:27:29.490" style="s2">hatred in your heart you are unfit to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.400" end="00:27:31.380" style="s2">king and that is the one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.490" end="00:27:33.929" style="s2">prominent lessons within black panther</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.380" end="00:27:37.290" style="s2">so the so the hero is able to correct</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.290" end="00:27:41.309" style="s2">tradition when tradition doesn&#39;t work or</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.420" end="00:27:43.050" style="s2">tradition needs to be updated right this</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.309" end="00:27:46.350" style="s2">is something that Jordan Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.050" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">about a lot when the tyrant father needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.350" end="00:27:51.420" style="s2">to sort of be updated in terms of how he</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:54.540" style="s2">behaves you have to have the hero which</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.420" end="00:27:57.210" style="s2">is the birth of both tradition and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.540" end="00:27:59.370" style="s2">right so the new and the old coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.210" end="00:28:00.750" style="s2">together to create a new and better</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.370" end="00:28:03.480" style="s2">balance and that&#39;s what the child</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.750" end="00:28:05.070" style="s2">represents and and that&#39;s why he has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.480" end="00:28:07.260" style="s2">make sure that kill monger doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.070" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t usurp but that&#39;s some of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:16.500" style="s2">particular and a lot of pop culture in</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.700" end="00:28:18.270" style="s2">general has influenced my work awesome</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.500" end="00:28:20.250" style="s2">thank you and we&#39;ve got some really</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.270" end="00:28:22.530" style="s2">great questions coming up the chat I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.250" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">like to start with Frank&#39;s question so</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.530" end="00:28:28.770" style="s2">Frank if you&#39;d like to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:29.640" style="s2">and ask your question to Chloe thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.770" end="00:28:32.820" style="s2">David</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.640" end="00:28:35.070" style="s2">hi Chloe so I&#39;ve been following you on</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.820" end="00:28:38.220" style="s2">Twitter for awhile and I find your</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.070" end="00:28:40.040" style="s2">perspective quite refreshing so my</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.220" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">question for you is very straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.040" end="00:28:46.559" style="s2">why is it called the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:48.960" style="s2">Enchantment why enchantment so so great</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.580" style="s2">question background information on how</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:52.110" style="s2">the theory of Enchantment developed I</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.580" end="00:28:56.280" style="s2">was at the Wall Street Journal for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.110" end="00:28:59.070" style="s2">year in 2015 I was working on a thesis</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.280" end="00:29:00.690" style="s2">paper my background and from from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.070" end="00:29:02.280" style="s2">college perspective is conflict</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.690" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2">resolution these are V like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.280" end="00:29:10.770" style="s2">International Studies I was working on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:12.150" style="s2">paper on this topic and there was no you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.770" end="00:29:14.400" style="s2">know there was all this</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.150" end="00:29:15.750" style="s2">how to get people to stop conflict which</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.400" end="00:29:18.030" style="s2">is to say how do you get people to stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.750" end="00:29:20.130" style="s2">hating and I realized that there was no</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.030" end="00:29:21.750" style="s2">framework within International Studies</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.130" end="00:29:24.450" style="s2">to ask the question of how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.750" end="00:29:26.460" style="s2">people to start loving and these two are</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.450" end="00:29:27.810" style="s2">not the same questions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.460" end="00:29:29.040" style="s2">interrelated questions but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.810" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">the same questions and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.040" end="00:29:32.760" style="s2">create a framework back teaches people</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:36.300" style="s2">how to love and so then I thought to</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.760" end="00:29:39.150" style="s2">myself well what if I ask what are</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.300" end="00:29:41.700" style="s2">people already in love with and then use</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.150" end="00:29:43.380" style="s2">that to create a framework for teaching</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.700" end="00:29:46.020" style="s2">people how to love and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.380" end="00:29:49.680" style="s2">people were in love with was pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.020" end="00:29:51.060" style="s2">and so I then started to study pop</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.680" end="00:29:52.860" style="s2">culture so see if there was a common</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.060" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">denominator cause various different</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.860" end="00:29:56.280" style="s2">influencers and companies and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.020" style="s2">celebrities terms of the content that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.280" end="00:30:00.660" style="s2">they were producing but there was a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.020" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">theme I&#39;ve studied companies like Nike I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.660" end="00:30:04.910" style="s2">studied artists like Beyonce</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:08.190" style="s2">I studied companies like Disney and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.910" end="00:30:10.920" style="s2">common denominator was all these</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.190" end="00:30:12.960" style="s2">entities and influencers are creating</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.920" end="00:30:15.660" style="s2">content where their audience sees</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">themselves and their potential reflected</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.660" end="00:30:20.580" style="s2">in the content and that&#39;s why we buy it</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.340" end="00:30:23.340" style="s2">and so you know Disney played a huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.580" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">role actually ultimately in informing my</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.340" end="00:30:28.800" style="s2">decision to make it to call it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:30.390" style="s2">enchantment but the real source of why I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.800" end="00:30:32.520" style="s2">called it enchantment was because of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.390" end="00:30:35.940" style="s2">book I read called</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.520" end="00:30:37.830" style="s2">enchantment by Guy Kawasaki was the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.940" end="00:30:40.590" style="s2">former marketing director of Apple and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:43.740" style="s2">he defines enchantment as the process by</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.590" end="00:30:46.890" style="s2">which you delight someone with a concept</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.740" end="00:30:49.680" style="s2">with an idea or what just you know your</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:55.260" style="s2">own personality and I found that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.680" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">delight very intriguing and very much a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.260" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">beautiful thing because he&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.990" style="s2">think of delight when I think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:02.550" style="s2">enchantment I think of this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.990" end="00:31:05.550" style="s2">wonder and I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.550" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">things were losing and our societies in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.550" end="00:31:09.930" style="s2">the West is our sense of wonder and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:12.390" style="s2">is related to the fact that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.930" end="00:31:13.740" style="s2">we&#39;re no longer speaking we&#39;re not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.390" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">no longer talking in a way that speaks</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.740" end="00:31:18.120" style="s2">to people&#39;s potential right that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s all related potential Wonder</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.120" end="00:31:22.530" style="s2">delight enchantment love these are these</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:25.080" style="s2">are words that are missing increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.530" end="00:31:25.950" style="s2">from our vocabulary and so to call it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.080" end="00:31:28.380" style="s2">enchantment</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.950" end="00:31:30.810" style="s2">what&#39;s really my attempt to try to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.380" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">some to bring those ideas back into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.810" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">fold</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.190" end="00:31:39.570" style="s2">so I&#39;m based in India and we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.470" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">messenger as well so yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.570" end="00:31:52.940" style="s2">answer thank you thank you Jacob would</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:56.220" style="s2">you like to ask your question yeah so uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.940" end="00:31:58.470" style="s2">since you&#39;re talking a lot well this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.220" end="00:32:02.179" style="s2">all about Jordan Peterson right so it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.470" end="00:32:05.309" style="s2">made me think of me chase Hammer</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.179" end="00:32:08.490" style="s2">he took a hammer to things and so and</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.309" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">then the wisdom of Solomon says there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.490" end="00:32:15.419" style="s2">a time to tear down and a time to build</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:17.280" style="s2">up so you said never tear down maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.419" end="00:32:21.299" style="s2">don&#39;t mean never but if you do mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.280" end="00:32:24.120" style="s2">never then it seems like well heavy</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.299" end="00:32:26.610" style="s2">appeared here&#39;s the question sure have</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.120" end="00:32:28.290" style="s2">you considered the need for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.610" end="00:32:31.890" style="s2">distinction between tearing down the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.290" end="00:32:33.090" style="s2">person so ad hominem tear down tearing</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.890" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">down the idea and tearing down the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.090" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">behavior because it seems like those</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:39.900" style="s2">things need to be parsed before we say</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.549" style="s2">never tear down right yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.900" end="00:32:49.260" style="s2">definitely those distinctions I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.549" end="00:32:50.730" style="s2">definitely mean don&#39;t dehumanize I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.260" end="00:32:55.590" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately what I mean so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.730" end="00:32:58.290" style="s2">again going back to the example of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.590" end="00:33:00.890" style="s2">leadership those involved in the civil</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.290" end="00:33:00.890" style="s2">rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.149" end="00:33:10.239" style="s2">one of the animating principles behind</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.169" end="00:33:13.539" style="s2">non-violence in the attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.239" end="00:33:16.419" style="s2">desegregate the diners was based upon</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.539" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">this concept of not dehumanizing anyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.419" end="00:33:24.309" style="s2">including your enemy because then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:27.190" style="s2">create or you contribute to a society</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.309" end="00:33:27.999" style="s2">that is unjust even in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.190" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.999" end="00:33:35.529" style="s2">so by tear down I don&#39;t mean this man I</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:39.099" style="s2">don&#39;t mean don&#39;t dismantle systems of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.529" end="00:33:42.190" style="s2">oppression but I am arguing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.099" end="00:33:45.070" style="s2">hard and nearly arguably impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.190" end="00:33:47.169" style="s2">dismantle a system of oppression if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.070" end="00:33:49.239" style="s2">are being oppressive in your language</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.169" end="00:33:51.789" style="s2">and if you&#39;re being dehumanizing toward</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.239" end="00:33:58.899" style="s2">your enemies so that is the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.789" end="00:34:04.299" style="s2">that I would make I hope that that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.899" end="00:34:17.279" style="s2">somewhat satisfied all right so next</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.299" end="00:34:21.220" style="s2">question here I climb I really enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.279" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">this as an ethical basis what I what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.220" end="00:34:24.609" style="s2">would struggle to imagine is how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:26.230" style="s2">apply this or I&#39;m just interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.609" end="00:34:28.569" style="s2">your tactics and like applying these</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.230" end="00:34:33.339" style="s2">ethics to everyday interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.569" end="00:34:36.250" style="s2">family and with friends who it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.339" end="00:34:37.809" style="s2">difficult to kind of mirror there to not</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.250" end="00:34:39.970" style="s2">mirror their confrontational attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.809" end="00:34:43.929" style="s2">like how do you apply this on a ground</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.970" end="00:34:50.200" style="s2">level well I can tell you that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.929" end="00:34:54.250" style="s2">personally have done a lot of self work</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.200" end="00:34:58.029" style="s2">so so the clear of interment course is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.250" end="00:34:59.890" style="s2">full twenty five lesson course and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.029" end="00:35:02.859" style="s2">first part the first one-third of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:04.690" style="s2">course is working on the self and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.859" end="00:35:06.730" style="s2">before you talk about how to have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.690" end="00:35:08.770" style="s2">healthy relationship with other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.730" end="00:35:11.230" style="s2">the primary question is how you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.770" end="00:35:14.260" style="s2">healthy relationship with yourself which</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.230" end="00:35:14.920" style="s2">means understanding yourself again as I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.260" end="00:35:17.410" style="s2">said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.920" end="00:35:20.589" style="s2">human being becoming comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.410" end="00:35:22.660" style="s2">your imperfections not overcompensating</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.589" end="00:35:24.549" style="s2">for them learning about your baggage not</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.660" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">overcompensating for them understanding</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.549" end="00:35:28.390" style="s2">that there are certain emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:31.180" style="s2">inform your behavior so for example I</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.390" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">know that when I am feeling insecure I</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.180" end="00:35:36.579" style="s2">may sometimes act defensive and so just</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:40.569" style="s2">understanding that about myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.579" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">I think equips me and positions me in</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.569" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">such a way to be able to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:49.420" style="s2">others because if I know for example</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:52.569" style="s2">that if I am feeling insecure I am</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.420" end="00:35:54.130" style="s2">defensive then when people let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.569" end="00:35:55.510" style="s2">when a family member is randomly</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.130" end="00:35:57.099" style="s2">seemingly randomly</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.510" end="00:36:00.970" style="s2">acting defensive toward me and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.099" end="00:36:03.880" style="s2">understand why it could be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.970" end="00:36:07.150" style="s2">they are feeling insecure right and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.880" end="00:36:08.470" style="s2">then I will modify my response being</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.150" end="00:36:11.619" style="s2">cognizant of the fact that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.470" end="00:36:14.020" style="s2">emotional baggage that&#39;s informing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.619" end="00:36:17.559" style="s2">behavior it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.020" end="00:36:19.750" style="s2">and so I would say the first step is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.559" end="00:36:21.400" style="s2">have to this is what I have to work on</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.750" end="00:36:25.150" style="s2">yourself and it&#39;s like a project like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.400" end="00:36:28.930" style="s2">daily practice obviously I also meditate</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.150" end="00:36:32.829" style="s2">for an hour a day and that really serves</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.930" end="00:36:35.710" style="s2">to calm down my nervous system in</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.829" end="00:36:37.270" style="s2">general and so yeah so just like trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.710" end="00:36:39.160" style="s2">to practice some of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.270" end="00:36:41.740" style="s2">teachings in the theory of enchant first</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.160" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">applying them to the self and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.740" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">applying them to the other it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:50.369" style="s2">long-term strategy because people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:55.240" style="s2">I don&#39;t think one becomes you know about</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.369" end="00:36:57.609" style="s2">able to to respond to confrontation with</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.240" end="00:37:00.250" style="s2">a less aggressive stance overnight</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.609" end="00:37:02.200" style="s2">that&#39;s just not how we&#39;re wired and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.250" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">it takes practice which is why you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.200" end="00:37:07.210" style="s2">so we teach tourism in the theory of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:08.970" style="s2">Enchantment platform as well so stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:11.470" style="s2">and practicing stoicism and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.970" end="00:37:12.819" style="s2">remember principles like take the view</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.470" end="00:37:15.069" style="s2">from above take the view from below</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.819" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">meditate on your mortality so that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.069" end="00:37:17.890" style="s2">understand that these emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.420" end="00:37:20.140" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing right now are</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.890" end="00:37:21.670" style="s2">totally fine emotions you can experience</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:24.069" style="s2">the emotions but you also have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.670" end="00:37:26.530" style="s2">to let the emotions pass right so these</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.069" end="00:37:28.660" style="s2">are very again daily practices that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.530" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">work on and that students</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.660" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">jamming coursework on to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:37.150" style="s2">be in better relationships with their</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:38.619" style="s2">with other members of their society that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.150" end="00:37:39.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean obviously that you agree</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.619" end="00:37:41.559" style="s2">because that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.670" end="00:37:44.380" style="s2">right you don&#39;t have to agree with with</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.559" end="00:37:46.900" style="s2">everyone that you encounter but I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.380" end="00:37:49.000" style="s2">the idea is to try and model that love</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.900" end="00:37:59.530" style="s2">and compassion even in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.000" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">profound disagreement thank you Jacob K</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.530" end="00:38:03.270" style="s2">would you like to ask your question Oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.359" end="00:38:20.410" style="s2">Jacob I can&#39;t hear you how about now is</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.980" style="s2">willingness to listen and learn and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.880" end="00:38:49.170" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the</p>

<p begin="00:39:05.730" end="00:39:10.059" style="s2">and then there&#39;s just the signaling of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.589" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">your willingness to do it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.059" end="00:39:20.380" style="s2">clear what and like from what kind of</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.869" end="00:39:33.279" style="s2">of like posting anything which is trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.260" end="00:39:37.510" style="s2">to speak to that and kind of complexify</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.430" end="00:40:07.690" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s confined</p>

<p begin="00:40:13.509" end="00:40:18.849" style="s2">slightly performative i I do think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.410" end="00:40:21.279" style="s2">a lot of people are coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.849" end="00:40:21.730" style="s2">sincere place when they post these</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.279" end="00:40:23.650" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.730" end="00:40:25.690" style="s2">I&#39;m not everyone is but a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.650" end="00:40:30.749" style="s2">are and I acknowledge that sincerity I</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.690" end="00:40:32.950" style="s2">honor that sincerity but I am a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.749" end="00:40:34.950" style="s2">like that&#39;s just not me that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.950" end="00:40:39.279" style="s2">I&#39;m about I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.950" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">meaningful really um I also am like</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.279" end="00:40:45.400" style="s2">really weirded out by like white people</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:51.670" style="s2">genuflecting and and doing a very</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.400" end="00:40:53.970" style="s2">strange sort of like like tell us what</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.670" end="00:40:57.160" style="s2">we should do because we are white and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.970" end="00:41:00.220" style="s2">you are black I find that very much</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.160" end="00:41:01.690" style="s2">antithetical to this to the first of all</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.220" end="00:41:03.489" style="s2">the point of the pursuit of justice and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.690" end="00:41:05.619" style="s2">to the spirit of the first principle of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.489" end="00:41:09.999" style="s2">the theory of Enchantment because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.619" end="00:41:13.029" style="s2">idea that I have some sort of holy</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.999" end="00:41:16.539" style="s2">knowledge merely because I am black is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.029" end="00:41:18.910" style="s2">silly and the idea that a white person</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.539" end="00:41:20.259" style="s2">has nothing to contribute to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.910" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">conversation merely because they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.259" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">white is also silly because again this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:28.950" style="s2">is this is the whole human being some</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:31.960" style="s2">political abstractions sort of situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.950" end="00:41:33.849" style="s2">so that&#39;s just me that&#39;s like my that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.960" end="00:41:35.769" style="s2">my natural response to it but I&#39;m also</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.299" end="00:42:49.579" style="s2">same way my question is one that I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.539" end="00:42:51.919" style="s2">has been asked many times and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.579" end="00:42:53.959" style="s2">there&#39;s some good thought on it but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.919" end="00:42:56.479" style="s2">haven&#39;t really studied the civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.959" end="00:43:00.109" style="s2">movement but just the question of if</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.479" end="00:43:03.469" style="s2">you&#39;re really committed to this peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.109" end="00:43:06.709" style="s2">form of protest what&#39;s to stop people</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.469" end="00:43:09.289" style="s2">who have the power from simply ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.709" end="00:43:11.890" style="s2">the peaceful protests so it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.289" end="00:43:14.539" style="s2">question there&#39;s a study that came out</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.890" end="00:43:19.609" style="s2">at Cambridge University I think last</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.539" end="00:43:22.219" style="s2">week that demonstrated the how the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.609" end="00:43:24.229" style="s2">nonviolent protests of the civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.219" end="00:43:28.219" style="s2">movement actually move the needle in</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.229" end="00:43:31.099" style="s2">terms of public opinion compared as</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.219" end="00:43:32.659" style="s2">compared to the violent protest sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.099" end="00:43:35.419" style="s2">the violent riots that took place in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.659" end="00:43:37.489" style="s2">late 60s and what they found was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.419" end="00:43:40.579" style="s2">first of all if whenever there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.489" end="00:43:44.329" style="s2">violence there will be media attention</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.579" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">and so the reason why the nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.329" end="00:43:50.029" style="s2">protests move the needle is because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:52.699" style="s2">the juxtaposition between state violence</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.029" end="00:43:54.979" style="s2">and the peaceful protesters because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.699" end="00:43:57.769" style="s2">was such a sharp dichotomy because it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.979" end="00:44:02.689" style="s2">was obvious like it was like obviously</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.769" end="00:44:05.059" style="s2">and ironically clear which camp was</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.689" end="00:44:08.719" style="s2">being civilized and which camp was being</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.059" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">uncivilized that actually helped push</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.719" end="00:44:12.799" style="s2">the needle forward in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:14.470" style="s2">public opinion so I think everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.799" end="00:44:17.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen with regard to media coverage</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.470" end="00:44:19.609" style="s2">sort of almost guarantees that if there</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.240" end="00:44:22.910" style="s2">is violence there will be there will be</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.609" end="00:44:26.359" style="s2">coverage and we&#39;ve because we&#39;ve seen up</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.910" end="00:44:29.720" style="s2">till now precedent of police forces</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.359" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">overdoing it in many many cases and with</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.720" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">regards to protests around the country</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:36.289" style="s2">and we because we see in some places</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:37.309" style="s2">state violence against peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.289" end="00:44:38.930" style="s2">protesters</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.309" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">we know that the media is there the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.930" end="00:44:45.910" style="s2">media is gonna cover it so then then the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:49.220" style="s2">question becomes okay so what is the as</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.910" end="00:44:51.349" style="s2">activists and as protesters how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.220" end="00:44:53.660" style="s2">compare ourselves given that we know</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.349" end="00:44:55.940" style="s2">that in the past this is what moves the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.660" end="00:44:58.039" style="s2">push the public opinion forward how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.940" end="00:44:59.299" style="s2">we compare ourselves and how do we not</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.039" end="00:45:01.010" style="s2">only from a moral perspective obviously</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.299" end="00:45:03.319" style="s2">but also from a strategic and tactical</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.010" end="00:45:08.420" style="s2">perspective create this juxtaposing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.319" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">image of uncivilised ie the state versus</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.420" end="00:45:15.230" style="s2">civilized and so I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:18.859" style="s2">enough of a the reason to consider at</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.230" end="00:45:21.260" style="s2">the very least comporting yourself as an</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.859" end="00:45:22.730" style="s2">activist in that way because we have we</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.260" end="00:45:27.049" style="s2">have precedent we have evidence that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.730" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">did work it did work in the past Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.049" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">and in just a quick follow-up I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">there&#39;s some evidence that in certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">contexts violent action affects change</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">and and do you do you think those have</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.069" style="s2">you studied the research do you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">that those results are non</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.069" end="00:45:49.609" style="s2">representative or have other negative</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:53.059" style="s2">effects well I think it would depend</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.609" end="00:45:56.270" style="s2">upon where it depends on so many factors</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.059" end="00:45:58.579" style="s2">right it depends on when you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.270" end="00:46:00.260" style="s2">violence that are you saying people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.579" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">getting beaten up are you saying stores</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.260" end="00:46:08.690" style="s2">are being looted are you saying people</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:10.220" style="s2">are destroying businesses and what so</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.690" end="00:46:12.349" style="s2">what is what is the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.220" end="00:46:16.369" style="s2">violence number one and what is the goal</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.349" end="00:46:18.770" style="s2">and so I would have to to be on like</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.369" end="00:46:20.539" style="s2">seriously and honestly like grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.770" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">that question I would have to know more</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.539" end="00:46:25.339" style="s2">specific details but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:30.799" style="s2">do believe in thesis antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.339" end="00:46:33.859" style="s2">synthesis right so so I I do understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.799" end="00:46:34.940" style="s2">and sympathize with I actually received</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.859" end="00:46:36.769" style="s2">this question today I was on a phone</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.940" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">call with Glenn Greenwald and I received</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.769" end="00:46:41.959" style="s2">the question about the wisdom or lack</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:44.180" style="s2">thereof of not people who are just being</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.959" end="00:46:46.910" style="s2">nihilistic and you know looting stores</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.180" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">but people who sincerely feel rage and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.910" end="00:46:51.799" style="s2">despair and the question was well what</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:56.890" style="s2">do I say to those people and I think my</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.799" end="00:47:01.430" style="s2">answer was I&#39;ve truly sympathize but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.890" end="00:47:04.369" style="s2">do believe that if we as activists want</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.430" end="00:47:09.859" style="s2">to create a just society we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.369" end="00:47:11.509" style="s2">afford to descend into despair because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.859" end="00:47:13.009" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.509" end="00:47:15.589" style="s2">after that it&#39;s like what next</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.009" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">you know um and also it&#39;s obviously easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.589" end="00:47:20.239" style="s2">for someone to call me a hypocrite if I</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:22.759" style="s2">say that I believe in justice but I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.239" end="00:47:25.400" style="s2">don&#39;t apply justice consistently across</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.759" end="00:47:27.079" style="s2">the board you know I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.400" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">easy to get caught up in in rage and</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.079" end="00:47:31.489" style="s2">despair and in the middle of a protest</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:35.890" style="s2">say eff white people but I also find</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.489" end="00:47:38.660" style="s2">that fundamentally immoral right and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.890" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">I think we have to we have to try our</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.660" end="00:47:43.339" style="s2">best to be our higher selves so but</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:50.180" style="s2">again I&#39;m definitely willing to grapple</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.339" end="00:47:52.789" style="s2">with the impact of violent protests and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.180" end="00:47:54.319" style="s2">counter protests and and and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.789" end="00:47:55.789" style="s2">don&#39;t think I&#39;ll necessarily have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.319" end="00:47:57.049" style="s2">concrete answer to that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.789" end="00:48:05.109" style="s2">definitely interested in continuing</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.049" end="00:48:05.109" style="s2">continuing to grapple with it thank you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.529" end="00:48:17.589" style="s2">Kaleo would you like to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.459" end="00:48:19.789" style="s2">oh yes I feel kind of bad for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.589" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">derailing the conversation I think was</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.789" end="00:48:24.440" style="s2">gonna reckon and I just wanna say thanks</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:28.369" style="s2">to Peter and Riven and Chloe for making</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.440" end="00:48:31.339" style="s2">this happen so my question is can you</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.369" end="00:48:33.589" style="s2">conceive of such a thing as like over</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.339" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">enchantment or hyper enchantment it</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.589" end="00:48:37.360" style="s2">seems like today our problems like</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:40.390" style="s2">access</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.360" end="00:48:44.020" style="s2">rather than not enough it might be very</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.390" end="00:48:47.830" style="s2">easy for people to find enchanting</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.020" end="00:48:50.320" style="s2">characters online just hyperstimulated</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.830" end="00:48:52.780" style="s2">themselves I never actually like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.320" end="00:49:01.120" style="s2">outsource their lives to characters or</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.780" end="00:49:03.970" style="s2">anything yeah I mean I I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.120" end="00:49:09.930" style="s2">I can control I think what I hope to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.970" end="00:49:13.060" style="s2">is to inspire people to practice to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.930" end="00:49:18.580" style="s2">develop certain practices within their</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.060" end="00:49:20.470" style="s2">life that enables them to fortify their</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.580" end="00:49:22.570" style="s2">character and four to five strength of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.470" end="00:49:28.120" style="s2">character and to the extent that someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.570" end="00:49:30.460" style="s2">is outsourcing that work to you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.120" end="00:49:33.130" style="s2">just I don&#39;t know retweeting me then</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.460" end="00:49:36.550" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.130" end="00:49:38.350" style="s2">inspire to do them to do and that I</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.550" end="00:49:39.610" style="s2">don&#39;t that might be my fault</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.350" end="00:49:41.230" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t know that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.610" end="00:49:42.820" style="s2">my fault I don&#39;t know the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.230" end="00:49:45.550" style="s2">which we can say that you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.820" end="00:49:47.410" style="s2">autonomous beings and some level we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.550" end="00:49:49.600" style="s2">to take responsibility for our actions</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.410" end="00:49:53.380" style="s2">and obviously what you&#39;re describing is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.600" end="00:49:58.030" style="s2">always a risk but all I can say is I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.380" end="00:50:02.830" style="s2">will try to do my best to inspire people</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.030" end="00:50:04.870" style="s2">to do the work themselves which is why</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.830" end="00:50:08.140" style="s2">theory of Enchantment is a course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.870" end="00:50:09.670" style="s2">an actual like rigorous course as</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.140" end="00:50:12.730" style="s2">opposed to just you know a series of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.670" end="00:50:13.930" style="s2">tweets and retweets but no I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.730" end="00:50:17.350" style="s2">a good point and I think I should I</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.930" end="00:50:19.450" style="s2">should be on guard and not fall into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.350" end="00:50:22.600" style="s2">trap and to check myself and to make</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.450" end="00:50:26.200" style="s2">sure that I am you know inspiring people</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.600" end="00:50:27.600" style="s2">to actually take action thank you I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.200" end="00:50:30.780" style="s2">want to make it clear that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.600" end="00:50:33.780" style="s2">suggesting that you&#39;re guilty of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.780" end="00:50:33.780" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.620" end="00:50:40.690" style="s2">great let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.140" end="00:50:45.279" style="s2">we have a question about reading</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.900" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.279" end="00:50:51.789" style="s2">oh here&#39;s here&#39;s one from Benjamin that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:53.680" style="s2">he asked me to ask you sure</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.789" end="00:50:55.240" style="s2">given that Peterson is controversial</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.680" end="00:50:57.130" style="s2">have you had to deal with any</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.240" end="00:50:59.529" style="s2">difficulties due to your appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.130" end="00:51:02.769" style="s2">for his work have you had to defend your</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.529" end="00:51:04.869" style="s2">appreciation if so what has worked also</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.769" end="00:51:09.900" style="s2">what is the best way to support your</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.869" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">work boost your signal oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:15.730" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just answer that one first and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:22.779" style="s2">guess I can can I post in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.730" end="00:51:25.960" style="s2">actually so here is Chapman&#39;s website so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.779" end="00:51:27.549" style="s2">you can check out a lot of our stuff the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.960" end="00:51:31.750" style="s2">course is up there and just our</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.549" end="00:51:32.920" style="s2">philosophy and like approach to life in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.750" end="00:51:35.650" style="s2">terms of Jordan Peterson it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.920" end="00:51:38.319" style="s2">interesting I actually haven&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.650" end="00:51:42.099" style="s2">flack yet you know I&#39;m sure that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.319" end="00:51:44.529" style="s2">will come up at some point I was when I</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.099" end="00:51:47.259" style="s2">was the moderator of questions for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.529" end="00:51:48.309" style="s2">film premiere of the rise and fall tour</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.259" end="00:51:52.390" style="s2">and Peterson so I actually know those</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.309" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">filmmakers and I was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.390" end="00:51:58.119" style="s2">premiere here here in Brooklyn a couple</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:59.890" style="s2">months ago in December and so even then</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.119" end="00:52:01.660" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get any weirdly enough I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.890" end="00:52:03.819" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get any flack I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.660" end="00:52:05.769" style="s2">reason perhaps why I haven&#39;t gotten any</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.819" end="00:52:08.220" style="s2">flack is because I think Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.769" end="00:52:11.319" style="s2">comes you know from a long line of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.220" end="00:52:13.029" style="s2">certain type of philosopher /</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.319" end="00:52:15.430" style="s2">psychologist I&#39;ve put in in the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.029" end="00:52:20.049" style="s2">camp as Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.430" end="00:52:22.210" style="s2">and and and coming up on Leah for</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.049" end="00:52:24.519" style="s2">example I actually think Camille Paglia</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.210" end="00:52:28.720" style="s2">is kind of superior but don&#39;t beat me up</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.519" end="00:52:31.059" style="s2">for that one but but I also bring in of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.720" end="00:52:32.349" style="s2">course a lot of pop culture and into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.059" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">conversations that I have when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.349" end="00:52:38.710" style="s2">talking about Jordan Peterson and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:41.470" style="s2">funny enough is it&#39;s almost as if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.710" end="00:52:45.970" style="s2">basically hacking the network and what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.470" end="00:52:49.809" style="s2">mean by that is joining Peterson is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.970" end="00:52:54.369" style="s2">much similar to and sometimes talks</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.809" end="00:52:54.819" style="s2">about Joseph Campbell right obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.369" end="00:52:57.099" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.819" end="00:52:59.679" style="s2">his commentary when it can&#39;t when it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.099" end="00:53:02.729" style="s2">comes to LGBTQ rights is the most</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.679" end="00:53:04.689" style="s2">controversial aspect of his work</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.729" end="00:53:08.410" style="s2">ironically I think that&#39;s the least</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.689" end="00:53:10.630" style="s2">important aspect of his work but when it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.410" end="00:53:13.329" style="s2">comes to his connection to folks like</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.630" end="00:53:15.279" style="s2">Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.329" end="00:53:17.559" style="s2">interesting about this is if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.279" end="00:53:20.049" style="s2">listen to let&#39;s say Oprah</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.559" end="00:53:23.219" style="s2">Oprah&#39;s podcasts Oprah&#39;s podcast</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.049" end="00:53:25.660" style="s2">mentions Joseph Campbell so many times</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.219" end="00:53:28.059" style="s2">like Joseph Campbell is a part of her</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.660" end="00:53:29.709" style="s2">universe and a part of her lexicon and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.059" end="00:53:33.549" style="s2">part of the way she thinks and you think</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.709" end="00:53:36.099" style="s2">about how popular both Oprah and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.549" end="00:53:38.979" style="s2">Jordan Peterson are it&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.099" end="00:53:43.239" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much overlap right</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.979" end="00:53:44.529" style="s2">and so my the way i hack the networks or</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.239" end="00:53:47.349" style="s2">the thing is by threading the needle</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.529" end="00:53:49.779" style="s2">right and and also by being seriously</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.349" end="00:53:50.979" style="s2">engaged in the these ideas and like</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.779" end="00:53:53.019" style="s2">really grappling with them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.979" end="00:53:54.339" style="s2">questioning them and unpacking them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.019" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">disagree when this is there in agreeing</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.339" end="00:54:01.479" style="s2">when necessary so it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:02.979" style="s2">for people to and people can obviously</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.479" end="00:54:04.779" style="s2">critique me and they do all the time but</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.979" end="00:54:07.239" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult for people to</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.779" end="00:54:09.459" style="s2">disparage to be disparaging in their</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.239" end="00:54:12.009" style="s2">criticism because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.459" end="00:54:14.969" style="s2">encourage people to stop doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.009" end="00:54:17.859" style="s2">so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.969" end="00:54:24.269" style="s2">so I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you any</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.859" end="00:54:26.679" style="s2">advice besides I decide just just being</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.269" end="00:54:28.299" style="s2">sincere and authentically grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.679" end="00:54:29.709" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s ideas but also</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.299" end="00:54:31.150" style="s2">grappling with other people&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.709" end="00:54:33.880" style="s2">would challenge her in Peterson I</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.150" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">thought his debate with jejak was quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.880" end="00:54:39.880" style="s2">fascinating not wasn&#39;t really a debate</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:42.549" style="s2">but it was quite fascinating um to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.880" end="00:54:44.669" style="s2">you know a Marxist and and someone like</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.549" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">during Peterson really actually come to</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.669" end="00:54:50.169" style="s2">come to form certain certain parts of</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:54.309" style="s2">agreement I wasn&#39;t really expecting that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.169" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">so yeah I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s all I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.309" end="00:54:58.269" style="s2">for that question I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:55:02.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s not as efficient as it could</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.269" end="00:55:05.049" style="s2">be all right well we&#39;re coming to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.380" end="00:55:06.429" style="s2">close here Chloe are there any final</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.049" end="00:55:07.450" style="s2">words that you would like to leave us</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.429" end="00:55:11.950" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.450" end="00:55:18.549" style="s2">we&#39;ll stay safe especially here in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.950" end="00:55:20.020" style="s2">United States of America and I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.549" end="00:55:22.390" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.020" end="00:55:24.099" style="s2">oftentimes perception is reality and if</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.390" end="00:55:25.510" style="s2">you perceive that things are hopeless</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.099" end="00:55:27.069" style="s2">and you will act in a manner that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.510" end="00:55:29.710" style="s2">indicates that things are hopeless and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.069" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">if you perceive that things are possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.710" end="00:55:35.710" style="s2">and or as a reminder the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">demonstrates to us that we are capable</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.710" end="00:55:39.730" style="s2">of overcoming our circumstances and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:41.140" style="s2">overcoming our situations and rising</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.730" end="00:55:44.339" style="s2">above and I can&#39;t tell you the college</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.140" end="00:55:47.740" style="s2">stories I know personally of you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.339" end="00:55:50.230" style="s2">you know former neo-nazis disavowing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.740" end="00:55:52.869" style="s2">their ties to racist movements - you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.230" end="00:55:55.270" style="s2">want to talk about Rwanda where an</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.869" end="00:55:58.390" style="s2">entire country decided to reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.270" end="00:56:00.339" style="s2">itself with itself we often talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.390" end="00:56:03.160" style="s2">the things that human beings do that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.339" end="00:56:04.540" style="s2">devastating and horrible but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.160" end="00:56:06.700" style="s2">speak enough about the things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.540" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">humans human beings do that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.700" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">incredibly resilient and incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:12.700" style="s2">transformative and I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:14.530" style="s2">put more of those images and more of</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:17.049" style="s2">those stories out into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.530" end="00:56:18.339" style="s2">forefront of our of our media outlets so</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.049" end="00:56:19.990" style="s2">that this becomes a self-fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.339" end="00:56:21.970" style="s2">prophecy the thing about self-fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.990" end="00:56:24.069" style="s2">prophecies is that it could be a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.970" end="00:56:26.260" style="s2">prophecy we sort of use that term in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.069" end="00:56:29.380" style="s2">negative connotation but it can become a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.260" end="00:56:31.059" style="s2">good a good prophecy so I encourage you</p>
