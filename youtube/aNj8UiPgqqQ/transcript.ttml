<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:06.779" style="s2">that all the early civilizations don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.140" end="00:00:09.389" style="s2">still exist whether we look at the Mayas</p>

<p begin="00:00:09.389" end="00:00:15.420" style="s2">Empire the Greek Empire the they they</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:17.369" style="s2">all collapsed and so the precedent is</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.420" end="00:00:21.029" style="s2">actually that civilization collapses not</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">that it maintains the real difference is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.029" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">that this is the first time we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">completely global civilization there</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">really is no such thing as USA or China</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">separate from each other when you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:33.920" style="s2">understand globalized materials</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.920" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">there&#39;s actually no country in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">that can make its own consumer</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">that happens from around the world so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:51.930" style="s2">our process of civilization is one that</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">has inherently self terminating dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.930" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">built into it when that happens at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:01:00.870" style="s2">fully global scale it is a basically the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">catastrophe is just unbounded where it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.870" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">has always been bounded as big as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:07.049" style="s2">Roman Empire was when it fell it wasn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.189" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">at 3/4 water planet took three and a</p>

<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">species and so you recognize that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.250" style="s2">led to war and environmental destruction</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">factoring exponential technology and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">when you start to think about</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">existential when you think about</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">like asking when we are talking about</p>

<p begin="00:05:09.990" end="00:05:16.980" style="s2">when I think about what economics is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:19.080" style="s2">economics is our value system codified</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.980" end="00:05:20.550" style="s2">as value equations that determines how</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.010" end="00:05:27.420" style="s2">incentivized to do and what we confer</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.630" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">power to so if a dead whale is worth a</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.940" end="00:07:02.380" style="s2">it and this is a really flawed system</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.860" end="00:07:03.550" style="s2">now we like it because like we said it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">seems like a good idea but somebody puts</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.500" end="00:07:56.530" style="s2">directly relevant to them and other</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:07:58.480" style="s2">people hate it based on if what it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.480" end="00:08:03.310" style="s2">created inexorable polarization because</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.540" end="00:08:05.170" style="s2">you made shitty propositions and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.310" end="00:08:06.640" style="s2">ask people to vote yes or no by an Arri</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.170" end="00:08:08.650" style="s2">on a shitty proposition so you notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.640" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">people actually don&#39;t all get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.650" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">contribute to the sense making of what a</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:15.220" style="s2">kind of collective input there there</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.690" end="00:08:20.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t even a generation of what would</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.220" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">good mean here and they so really even</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.410" end="00:08:24.490" style="s2">their choice making is just yes or no on</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:26.920" style="s2">a frame that was already controlled and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.490" end="00:08:28.570" style="s2">typically who&#39;s going to be able to even</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.920" end="00:08:31.960" style="s2">put forward a proposition as someone who</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.570" end="00:08:35.020" style="s2">has vested interests and so you&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.960" end="00:08:38.140" style="s2">with polarization in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.020" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">system right so we need new systems of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.140" end="00:08:42.130" style="s2">governance that are not any system of</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.130" end="00:08:46.600" style="s2">far there are systems of how do we</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.600" end="00:08:51.190" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on make sense of what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.970" end="00:08:54.490" style="s2">actually value and how those values can</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.190" end="00:08:54.940" style="s2">be synergistically satisfied rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.490" end="00:08:56.590" style="s2">a theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.940" end="00:08:59.800" style="s2">trade offs with each other progressively</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.590" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">better and how do we create design that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.800" end="00:09:04.780" style="s2">are optimal synergistic satisfiers so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">that&#39;s totally new thing governance wise</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.780" end="00:09:07.750" style="s2">we need totally new systems of economics</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">we need totally new systems of Education</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:14.290" style="s2">healthcare all the way down to at an</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:16.600" style="s2">individual level a new basis for</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.600" end="00:09:20.110" style="s2">making choice making as long as I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:21.640" style="s2">that I&#39;m an individual that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.110" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">fundamentally separate from you and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.640" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">biosphere and everything else I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">think about optimizing my own quality of</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.060" end="00:09:36.970" style="s2">as I get that I start to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.170" end="00:09:40.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not that tree but what would I be</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.970" end="00:09:41.830" style="s2">without trees why would not exist right</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.120" end="00:09:43.960" style="s2">well there would be no atmosphere if</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.830" end="00:09:45.730" style="s2">they weren&#39;t plants photosynthesizing so</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.960" end="00:09:48.640" style="s2">I fundamentally am not even a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.730" end="00:09:51.910" style="s2">concept without plants so if I think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.640" end="00:09:53.140" style="s2">myself as me that is not fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">interdependent with plants I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.140" end="00:09:56.380" style="s2">just not even thinking clearly right</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:59.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just a bad ontology it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.380" end="00:10:01.830" style="s2">semiotic s-- and then I start to run</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.530" end="00:10:05.080" style="s2">that and say well what about soil</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.830" end="00:10:07.600" style="s2">microbiota and what about and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.080" end="00:10:10.210" style="s2">out that my life depends on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.600" end="00:10:11.590" style="s2">thing right so I am really I can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.210" end="00:10:13.750" style="s2">better thought of as an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.590" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">property of this whole thing right not</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.750" end="00:10:19.960" style="s2">just a biosphere because what would it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:21.700" style="s2">be without the Sun and so as long as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.960" end="00:10:23.530" style="s2">have a sense of AI that is separate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.700" end="00:10:25.780" style="s2">maybe even rival ris&#39;n rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.530" end="00:10:28.150" style="s2">competition for some scarce status</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.780" end="00:10:31.570" style="s2">resource attention partner or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:33.970" style="s2">it is then we have a fundamental basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.570" end="00:10:35.650" style="s2">for war and in a world of exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.970" end="00:10:37.030" style="s2">increasing technology which means that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.650" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">the warfare gets to be more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.030" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">consequential that will self terminate</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:44.580" style="s2">so rival risk dynamics multiplied by</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.580" end="00:10:49.180" style="s2">exponential tech is inexorable we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.870" end="00:10:51.010" style="s2">put it away so we either figure out anti</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:53.530" style="s2">rivalry or we go extinct human</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.010" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">experiment comes to a completion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.530" end="00:10:58.330" style="s2">like that&#39;s the core thing figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:11:00.700" style="s2">anti rivalry is a psycho-spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.330" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">process inside of ourselves can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.700" end="00:11:03.550" style="s2">actually even get along with our family</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:05.800" style="s2">members can we pay attention to our</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">from sovereignty because the moment I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.860" end="00:11:13.870" style="s2">be an angry person I&#39;m actually hijacked</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.420" end="00:11:17.650" style="s2">right can I pay attention to that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.870" end="00:11:19.270" style="s2">actually have some sovereignty over my</p>
