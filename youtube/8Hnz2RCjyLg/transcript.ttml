<p begin="00:10:05.679" end="00:10:11.980" style="s2">worth watching and for me this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.730" end="00:10:15.009" style="s2">bioregional term is is something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.980" end="00:10:17.259" style="s2">comes out of my own 20 year journey in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.009" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">all of this for a very long time I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.259" end="00:10:23.379" style="s2">very active in the global eco village</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:26.309" style="s2">network and eco village movement lived</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.379" end="00:10:29.169" style="s2">in an eco village in Scotland at Finland</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.309" end="00:10:31.569" style="s2">helped to spread the news on the</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.789" end="00:10:44.289" style="s2">world and so my focus was very much on</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.129" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">how do we create the whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.289" end="00:10:48.759" style="s2">design at the community level how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:50.739" style="s2">put all the pieces of the puzzle in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.759" end="00:10:54.699" style="s2">place to create a sustainable community</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.739" end="00:10:56.829" style="s2">and I&#39;ve moved on a little bit from that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.699" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">by under it through understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.829" end="00:11:00.790" style="s2">very often these these</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:03.810" style="s2">intentional community projects which are</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.790" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">wonderful laboratories of innovation and</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.080" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">build a village from scratch often</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.860" end="00:11:24.460" style="s2">forget the link to their region and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:27.520" style="s2">it takes a long time afterwards to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.460" end="00:11:30.370" style="s2">retrofit that and reach out again to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.520" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">thereby original context but beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.370" end="00:11:34.930" style="s2">even I&#39;ve also realized that there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:36.700" style="s2">certain things that do need a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.930" end="00:11:39.400" style="s2">of an economy of scale they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.700" end="00:11:43.060" style="s2">to be globalized and and scaled up to</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.650" end="00:12:02.080" style="s2">speak a lot about the fact that what</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.010" end="00:12:05.290" style="s2">we&#39;re called to do now is to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.080" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">the human impact and presence on earth</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.290" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">within the lifetime of the generations</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:13.270" style="s2">and we have to redesign it in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:16.120" style="s2">that the overall impact of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.270" end="00:12:20.080" style="s2">stops being degenerative exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.120" end="00:12:22.150" style="s2">and negative to people and planet but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.080" end="00:12:26.410" style="s2">becomes regenerative again and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.150" end="00:12:29.380" style="s2">replenishing and restorative em and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.410" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">only way we can do that is to fit back</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.380" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">into the patterns of our ancestors that</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.520" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">we look at a map today we see these very</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.339" end="00:12:51.339" style="s2">straight lines that were literally drawn</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:54.370" style="s2">by the rulers of rulers by colonialists</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.339" end="00:12:56.050" style="s2">by but these nation-states the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.370" end="00:12:58.660" style="s2">hundred and a few nation-states that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.050" end="00:13:01.860" style="s2">now have around the planet I actually</p>

<p begin="00:13:32.149" end="00:13:38.600" style="s2">this is right this is a fast-moving</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:41.029" style="s2">change but but if we begin to redesign</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.600" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">our human impact on on earth we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.029" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">pay attention to the biophysical reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:50.720" style="s2">of the bio regions we inhabit and what</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.020" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">we need to also think about how do we</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.030" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">simply isn&#39;t like it&#39;s it&#39;s not a scale</p>

<p begin="00:21:55.410" end="00:22:00.570" style="s2">really hit the messy wicked problem</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.570" end="00:22:05.940" style="s2">then you have to look at what are the</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.940" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">and not see them as evil and other but</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.760" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">begin to have a conversation with them</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:15.059" style="s2">of how could they regionalize how could</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.710" end="00:22:39.450" style="s2">they looked at instead of if they really</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.380" end="00:22:41.790" style="s2">looked at the potential that is in the</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.610" end="00:23:05.549" style="s2">process we would begin to answer a lot</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.589" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">started to learn more about this from</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.149" end="00:34:53.220" style="s2">the realm of cities Daniel was in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.220" end="00:34:57.060" style="s2">okay so New York I didn&#39;t either the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:34:59.070" style="s2">Croton water system I kind of as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.060" end="00:35:00.630" style="s2">Manhattanite you don&#39;t really get to see</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.070" end="00:35:03.000" style="s2">much nature it takes a while to drive</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.630" end="00:35:04.740" style="s2">through cities to get that although I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.000" end="00:35:06.599" style="s2">also learned from an with since firm</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.740" end="00:35:10.349" style="s2">that cities are nature and it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.599" end="00:35:12.690" style="s2">way that we think about them but really</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.349" end="00:35:14.010" style="s2">were I saw by regional collaboration and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.690" end="00:35:15.900" style="s2">my original thinking was when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.010" end="00:35:17.369" style="s2">Seattle and we talked about the Cascadia</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.900" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">fire region it goes from northern</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.369" end="00:35:25.010" style="s2">california up to alaska and we started</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">to look at how we harmonized political</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.010" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">discussions or policies way to climate</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:33.540" style="s2">change water protection life shed</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.200" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">protection so to speak and was</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.540" end="00:35:38.609" style="s2">collaborating across that broad spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.640" end="00:35:40.680" style="s2">of area primarily thinking about salmon</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.609" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">which had a strong context for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.680" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">cultural identity of that region going</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:46.200" style="s2">back to the first peoples that was their</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:49.140" style="s2">economy that was their livelihood that</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.200" end="00:35:51.780" style="s2">was their totem and when we started</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.140" end="00:35:53.490" style="s2">bringing city making in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.780" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">how we protect salmon it changed the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:59.550" style="s2">we localized bioregional thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:02.580" style="s2">our impacts of urbanizing you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.550" end="00:36:06.060" style="s2">northwest in a way that had no adverse</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.580" end="00:36:08.910" style="s2">impact on the salmon habitats so we</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.060" end="00:36:10.940" style="s2">created a I guess a place-based program</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.910" end="00:36:13.160" style="s2">called salmon safe that looked at</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.940" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">how we designed our roads building an</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.160" end="00:36:19.039" style="s2">infrastructure that we knew would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:22.549" style="s2">no adverse impact the there we go</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.039" end="00:36:24.440" style="s2">cascaded by region on salmon and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.549" end="00:36:26.240" style="s2">required us having like Janine taught me</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.440" end="00:36:28.190" style="s2">to have but you know biologists and rain</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.240" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">biologists at the design table for</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.190" end="00:36:32.510" style="s2">teaching me as a developer that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.980" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use certain facade materials</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.510" end="00:36:36.619" style="s2">because they were endocrine disrupters</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.980" end="00:36:37.970" style="s2">for fish or other species so it really</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.619" end="00:36:40.430" style="s2">taught us things that we wouldn&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.970" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">know unless we have those experts around</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.430" end="00:36:46.190" style="s2">us giving us diversity of thought but</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.109" style="s2">also when were teaching and educating</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.190" end="00:36:50.510" style="s2">our kids in schools K through 12 or</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.109" end="00:36:52.819" style="s2">higher ed it&#39;s crucial that we give them</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.510" end="00:36:56.089" style="s2">an association I mean Charles will talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.819" end="00:36:57.619" style="s2">about growing up in a in a in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.089" end="00:36:59.770" style="s2">where there&#39;s tannic relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.619" end="00:37:02.450" style="s2">more which he talked about last session</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.770" end="00:37:04.730" style="s2">associate with you the mental model of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.450" end="00:37:09.549" style="s2">your bio region and your your nation&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.730" end="00:37:12.049" style="s2">kind of footprint I had to take my</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.549" end="00:37:14.510" style="s2">graduate students at u-dub is to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.049" end="00:37:17.059" style="s2">them out to the watershed in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.510" end="00:37:19.130" style="s2">cascading Mountains and then I took him</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.059" end="00:37:21.829" style="s2">to the waste treatment plant so they</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.130" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">actually saw the full drop of rain cycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.829" end="00:37:25.579" style="s2">from where the catchment was all the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:27.619" style="s2">down through the city how it got there</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.579" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">and then where it went on the back end</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.619" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">but then we also went to non point</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:33.490" style="s2">discharge did kayaking down the Duwamish</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:36.200" style="s2">River to pick up way so they saw the I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.490" end="00:37:38.630" style="s2">guess the non point straight off run</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:40.789" style="s2">from urban environments so that they</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.630" end="00:37:43.130" style="s2">sort of developed a mental map of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.789" end="00:37:44.329" style="s2">bio region in Seattle because they just</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.130" end="00:37:46.730" style="s2">don&#39;t there&#39;s all their whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.329" end="00:37:48.740" style="s2">Association was like here&#39;s our square</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.730" end="00:37:50.089" style="s2">block of land we&#39;re going to plug in to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.740" end="00:37:52.369" style="s2">the infrastructure and build this thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.089" end="00:37:53.750" style="s2">and not really think about worth coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.369" end="00:37:55.670" style="s2">from where it&#39;s really going so most</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.750" end="00:37:57.380" style="s2">people don&#39;t know where their water</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.670" end="00:37:59.180" style="s2">catchment is if you ask them so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.380" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">something that we have to reprogram into</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.180" end="00:38:04.099" style="s2">our thinking and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.650" style="s2">incredible lessons that I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.099" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">from some gels and first peoples all</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.650" end="00:38:12.380" style="s2">over the world on you know how the story</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:14.299" style="s2">of my regionalism is ingrained in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.380" end="00:38:17.180" style="s2">culture and the storytelling and raising</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.299" end="00:38:19.250" style="s2">the children only formally in school but</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.180" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">in the home and how it&#39;s talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.250" end="00:38:25.740" style="s2">and how people spend time on a country</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:28.020" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to have that as our</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.740" end="00:38:29.250" style="s2">association in the cities or so you go</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.020" end="00:38:30.810" style="s2">to the supermarket you don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.250" end="00:38:33.570" style="s2">your food really is coming from most</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.810" end="00:38:35.609" style="s2">people and you go visit nature to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:37.980" style="s2">hiking on the weekend right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.609" end="00:38:40.470" style="s2">really changing that paradigm we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.980" end="00:38:42.330" style="s2">starting to get into that dialogue of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.470" end="00:38:45.570" style="s2">how do we even change our in-place</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.330" end="00:38:47.099" style="s2">naming like I I can&#39;t wait til we get to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.570" end="00:38:49.020" style="s2">a point where I can say hey what</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.099" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">watershed are you from you know think</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.020" end="00:38:53.010" style="s2">about the way that we name places in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:55.530" style="s2">mental activity a place you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:38:56.760" style="s2">start to change that dialogue you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.530" end="00:38:58.230" style="s2">we can start to shift some of the new</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.760" end="00:38:59.940" style="s2">community as a child and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.230" end="00:39:01.530" style="s2">involved with planning here we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.940" end="00:39:03.840" style="s2">were deciding around water catchments</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.530" end="00:39:05.550" style="s2">and hoping that we can basically build</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.840" end="00:39:07.800" style="s2">that culture a new new community so</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.550" end="00:39:11.700" style="s2">people can say that where&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.800" end="00:39:13.590" style="s2">watershed but I&#39;ll pass on to the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.700" end="00:39:15.859" style="s2">wonderful people kind of continue to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.590" end="00:39:15.859" style="s2">thread</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.820" end="00:39:31.499" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.549" end="00:39:36.059" style="s2">I can have a go okay so I&#39;m glad that</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.499" end="00:39:38.130" style="s2">you put that map up Jason and yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.059" end="00:39:42.630" style="s2">noticed a comment here from from Sandra</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.130" end="00:39:44.579" style="s2">yes yeah the the cultures that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.630" end="00:39:49.049" style="s2">existing on that map are still ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.579" end="00:39:52.769" style="s2">and strong and continuing and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.049" end="00:39:55.289" style="s2">that&#39;s part of this paradigm shift that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.769" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of trying to make people</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.289" end="00:40:02.900" style="s2">aware of is that um yeah indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.900" end="00:40:07.229" style="s2">people and culture in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.900" end="00:40:10.499" style="s2">throughout time you got it right and had</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.229" end="00:40:13.769" style="s2">it right and you know if we look and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.499" end="00:40:16.619" style="s2">draw upon the the aspects of those</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.769" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">paradigms and thought processes to help</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.619" end="00:40:23.219" style="s2">as something in the toolbox to move</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:26.189" style="s2">towards you know people understanding</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.219" end="00:40:29.729" style="s2">you know the restoration of this planet</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.189" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">that yeah our mother is in essential</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.729" end="00:40:33.929" style="s2">yeah palliative care and anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:37.469" style="s2">that&#39;s sick</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.929" end="00:40:41.519" style="s2">yeh you usually have the emotional</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.519" end="00:40:49.709" style="s2">and that map I was going to talk to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.900" end="00:40:54.660" style="s2">map Jason so you was zoning into my mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.709" end="00:40:56.729" style="s2">frame if you look at those that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.660" end="00:40:59.969" style="s2">existing language groups in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.729" end="00:41:03.089" style="s2">and how diverse it was yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.969" end="00:41:07.019" style="s2">looking at more than what 250 you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.089" end="00:41:10.729" style="s2">300 800 sort of dialects and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.019" end="00:41:14.489" style="s2">variations of language and then groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.729" end="00:41:17.789" style="s2">you know all these areas are an example</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.489" end="00:41:21.569" style="s2">of these these local and regional trade</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.789" end="00:41:24.869" style="s2">areas and that&#39;s how things functioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.569" end="00:41:30.869" style="s2">and yeah in a lot of places still to to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.869" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">do today yeah so that that practice is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.869" end="00:41:36.510" style="s2">is basically embedded</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:40.890" style="s2">yes so much that yeah a lot of this this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.510" end="00:41:46.349" style="s2">regional trade and regional get-together</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.890" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">or dialectal or exchange you know was</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.349" end="00:41:53.670" style="s2">embedded that it was actually timed and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:56.609" style="s2">planned around ecological seasons so a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.670" end="00:42:00.410" style="s2">lot of that movement and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.609" end="00:42:03.319" style="s2">action of of regional trade and regional</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.410" end="00:42:06.329" style="s2">interaction was around seasons and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.319" end="00:42:09.270" style="s2">that&#39;s something that more AG spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.329" end="00:42:11.640" style="s2">before is that whole eating and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.270" end="00:42:15.329" style="s2">operating and working within the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.640" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">constructor of seasonality but also</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.329" end="00:42:20.549" style="s2">think goes with those local bio regions</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">and the local happenings within the area</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.549" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">yes things like you know when when when</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.980" end="00:42:27.059" style="s2">mullet are migrating yeah you&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:30.089" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a food base in a resource to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.059" end="00:42:32.760" style="s2">be able to host your visitors you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.089" end="00:42:36.990" style="s2">something that can then you extend into</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.760" end="00:42:39.390" style="s2">offering as your you know you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.990" end="00:42:42.059" style="s2">all your contribution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.390" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">to just showing people your country and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.059" end="00:42:45.809" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in your country and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:50.390" style="s2">functions and systems within your</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.809" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">country yeah these these ecological</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.390" end="00:42:56.329" style="s2">cycles and these each ecological systems</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:42:58.799" style="s2">or atmospheric systems as well and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.329" end="00:43:01.020" style="s2">geological systems yeah that they also</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.799" end="00:43:03.270" style="s2">had social constructs attached to them</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.020" end="00:43:06.150" style="s2">so you know in these social constructs</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.270" end="00:43:09.210" style="s2">you had things like ceremony we still do</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.150" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">and and harvests and dance and art so</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.210" end="00:43:15.660" style="s2">this whole social construct of existence</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:18.450" style="s2">yeah revolved around you know these</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.660" end="00:43:20.970" style="s2">these this seasonality and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.450" end="00:43:23.910" style="s2">time and then which then came back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.970" end="00:43:26.460" style="s2">the local areas and regionalism and bio</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.910" end="00:43:30.059" style="s2">regionalism within those areas yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.460" end="00:43:32.520" style="s2">not a new ideology it&#39;s it&#39;s been around</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.059" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">for a very long time and it worked it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.520" end="00:43:36.839" style="s2">worked a hundred percent and it worked</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">so much as daniel said that yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.839" end="00:43:42.470" style="s2">in existence for forty thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:45.660" style="s2">and still exists today as we sit here</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.470" end="00:43:47.220" style="s2">and a lot of that sort of mindset that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.660" end="00:43:50.990" style="s2">paradigm that mine frame is</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.220" end="00:43:53.580" style="s2">still existing in Australia and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.990" end="00:43:55.650" style="s2">would all be idiots if we don&#39;t start</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:58.440" style="s2">drawing upon that knowledge that&#39;s left</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.650" end="00:44:00.420" style="s2">and that logic that&#39;s still existing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.440" end="00:44:02.490" style="s2">not only in Australia but in other</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.420" end="00:44:05.490" style="s2">countries throughout the world where</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.490" end="00:44:07.470" style="s2">indigenous people you know lead and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.490" end="00:44:10.560" style="s2">showed you know what true sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.470" end="00:44:13.410" style="s2">sustainability is and the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.560" end="00:44:16.859" style="s2">the Nexus and the foundations of what</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.410" end="00:44:20.340" style="s2">that consists of and a lot of it has to</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.859" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">do with that equity and its equity in</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.340" end="00:44:26.460" style="s2">knowing your place you know within the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:29.160" style="s2">planet and not taking too much and as as</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.460" end="00:44:31.710" style="s2">much as you need it&#39;s about you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.160" end="00:44:34.280" style="s2">knowing that every living organism has a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.710" end="00:44:34.280" style="s2">right to exist</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.320" end="00:44:43.330" style="s2">I think thanks Charles gosh thanks</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.730" end="00:44:47.020" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.330" end="00:44:49.090" style="s2">such a rich a rich conversation in so</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.020" end="00:44:50.950" style="s2">many threads and I&#39;d love to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.090" end="00:44:54.220" style="s2">but I think I&#39;ll start with what Charles</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.950" end="00:44:55.870" style="s2">was just saying there about the need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.220" end="00:44:57.970" style="s2">to really have that emotional</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.870" end="00:44:59.890" style="s2">intelligence to respond to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.970" end="00:45:03.760" style="s2">happening and something that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.890" end="00:45:06.750" style="s2">to bring up with and I think that really</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.760" end="00:45:10.050" style="s2">the way that we need to focus on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.750" end="00:45:13.480" style="s2">restoring bioregions is through an</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.050" end="00:45:16.090" style="s2">economy of love an economy of care and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.480" end="00:45:17.950" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s through those enriching</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.090" end="00:45:19.630" style="s2">relationships that we build with</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.950" end="00:45:22.630" style="s2">community with the place and when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.630" end="00:45:24.730" style="s2">begin to really have a sense of who we</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.630" end="00:45:26.620" style="s2">are in that place and to actually really</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.730" end="00:45:29.350" style="s2">love and respect and care for that place</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.620" end="00:45:31.590" style="s2">that things start to shift that we start</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.350" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">to live in a way that we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.590" end="00:45:37.540" style="s2">taking care of the waterways of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:40.060" style="s2">resources of of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.540" end="00:45:43.030" style="s2">living there I just wanted to give like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.060" end="00:45:44.590" style="s2">a really little example but of when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.030" end="00:45:46.360" style="s2">start to think about all different</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.590" end="00:45:51.460" style="s2">aspects of our lives being more placed</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.360" end="00:45:54.040" style="s2">based and and and connected I built this</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.460" end="00:45:55.540" style="s2">little house that we we have here at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.040" end="00:45:58.420" style="s2">eco village at Crystal waters I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.540" end="00:46:01.390" style="s2">living here for for 20 years and one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.420" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">the so my benches in the kitchen for</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.390" end="00:46:07.720" style="s2">example benches that are made from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:10.030" style="s2">timber from the ridge across I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.720" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">exactly where the timber has come from</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.030" end="00:46:15.420" style="s2">and I know why that particular tree was</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:17.650" style="s2">removed it wasn&#39;t just part of a big</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.420" end="00:46:19.180" style="s2">clear cutting going down to the hardware</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.650" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">and picking some timber the right size</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.180" end="00:46:23.170" style="s2">the tree had to come out because it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:26.230" style="s2">about to fall on some cabins it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.170" end="00:46:29.020" style="s2">rotted out so we we harvested that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.230" end="00:46:31.330" style="s2">we slabbed it up and stored it under the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.020" end="00:46:32.770" style="s2">house for four twelve months until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.330" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2">right and then we picked a shape of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.770" end="00:46:37.230" style="s2">we actually designed the benches around</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.300" end="00:46:40.420" style="s2">that and my dad helped me do it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.230" end="00:46:44.140" style="s2">there&#39;s part of this when I look at that</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.420" end="00:46:45.820" style="s2">bench it this deep sense of connected</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.140" end="00:46:47.980" style="s2">like we take care of that bench it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.820" end="00:46:50.170" style="s2">like old it&#39;s just well if we damage it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.980" end="00:46:51.960" style="s2">we can just check it out it&#39;s a this</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.170" end="00:46:55.770" style="s2">sense of deep respect and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.960" end="00:46:57.450" style="s2">when you have have a relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.770" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">resource you have a relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.450" end="00:47:00.810" style="s2">place where it&#39;s from you have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:03.000" style="s2">relationship to the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.810" end="00:47:05.150" style="s2">involved in the process another example</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.000" end="00:47:07.890" style="s2">when we&#39;re making a little chicken house</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.150" end="00:47:10.920" style="s2">here at Crystal waters is a guy called</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.890" end="00:47:13.260" style="s2">Peter who has a woodlot 20 years ago he</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.920" end="00:47:14.839" style="s2">started this woodlot on the on the south</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.260" end="00:47:17.430" style="s2">side of the slope where it&#39;s no good for</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.839" end="00:47:20.540" style="s2">building houses or growing food and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.430" end="00:47:22.740" style="s2">it&#39;s with pretty much Maine half of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.540" end="00:47:26.280" style="s2">crystal waters the Eco village which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.740" end="00:47:29.220" style="s2">about 650 acres is regeneration and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.280" end="00:47:33.210" style="s2">no one touches that bit but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.220" end="00:47:35.400" style="s2">pocket where we can create harvest zones</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.210" end="00:47:37.530" style="s2">for the for timber so I needed some</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.400" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">timber for building a chicken house so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.530" end="00:47:42.030" style="s2">went over to Peter and I said okay what</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:43.950" style="s2">have you got and so we walked around the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.030" end="00:47:46.410" style="s2">first and he and we picked the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.950" end="00:47:48.359" style="s2">particular trees that we thought would</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.410" end="00:47:50.280" style="s2">be appropriate for it and he said come</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.359" end="00:47:52.380" style="s2">back tomorrow so you know when I every</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.280" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">day when I walk down past my chicken</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.380" end="00:47:58.560" style="s2">house and I go in and look after them I</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:48:00.750" style="s2">have this sense of relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.560" end="00:48:03.330" style="s2">forest to the land to the soil to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.750" end="00:48:05.550" style="s2">people and and there&#39;s a and as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.330" end="00:48:07.410" style="s2">respect and so I think when we start to</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.550" end="00:48:10.410" style="s2">get that relationship of love and care</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.410" end="00:48:12.390" style="s2">we&#39;re far less wasteful of the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.410" end="00:48:15.050" style="s2">that we use we&#39;re far more appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.390" end="00:48:18.270" style="s2">of all the different elements of of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.050" end="00:48:20.510" style="s2">and so you know there&#39;s a few things</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.270" end="00:48:23.700" style="s2">that I wanted to touch on to just about</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.510" end="00:48:25.080" style="s2">this idea of the local economy I live in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.700" end="00:48:28.260" style="s2">it I live in quite an extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.080" end="00:48:31.080" style="s2">little place I realize every day how</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.260" end="00:48:33.810" style="s2">wonderful it is the local Mullaney</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.080" end="00:48:37.140" style="s2">community so Krista waters where I live</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.810" end="00:48:44.010" style="s2">is an eco village that exists within</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.140" end="00:48:46.560" style="s2">this broader sense of of living a more</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.010" end="00:48:48.810" style="s2">ecological life not completely but there</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.560" end="00:48:50.790" style="s2">is this broader sense of that so very</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.810" end="00:48:53.910" style="s2">much a connection of where we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.790" end="00:48:55.800" style="s2">catchment connection to indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.910" end="00:48:57.660" style="s2">culture there&#39;s the there&#39;s a banya</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.800" end="00:49:00.599" style="s2">festival that happens here that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.660" end="00:49:04.099" style="s2">reinstated after a hundred years and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.599" end="00:49:05.619" style="s2">burner is this amazing tree which has 10</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.099" end="00:49:08.980" style="s2">kilogram</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.619" end="00:49:10.569" style="s2">our pinecones that that fall around</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.980" end="00:49:13.240" style="s2">January and so every January there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.569" end="00:49:15.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a Vanya Festival and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.240" end="00:49:18.009" style="s2">whole this is a whole tradition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.460" end="00:49:19.480" style="s2">being going for you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.009" end="00:49:21.759" style="s2">how long chills it&#39;s been going maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.480" end="00:49:23.559" style="s2">you can you know anything about that but</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.759" end="00:49:25.869" style="s2">it it stopped about a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.559" end="00:49:28.539" style="s2">but it&#39;s been reinstated but</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.869" end="00:49:32.710" style="s2">interestingly our local currency is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.539" end="00:49:36.099" style="s2">called Hibernia and so we have a local a</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.710" end="00:49:39.490" style="s2">local economic exchange system we also</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.099" end="00:49:41.140" style="s2">have a local bank when when people</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.490" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">started doing the back to the land thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.140" end="00:49:45.309" style="s2">here in the Mullaney region there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:48.009" style="s2">not much going on it was dying rural</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.309" end="00:49:49.660" style="s2">town and so one of the things that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.009" end="00:49:52.779" style="s2">the first thing to get started was was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.660" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">local bank and a local food co-op and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.779" end="00:49:56.740" style="s2">through a whole lot of cooperatives</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:59.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to sort of revitalize</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.740" end="00:50:02.259" style="s2">this local area and and to really shift</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.740" end="00:50:04.140" style="s2">how that how the community feels about</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.259" end="00:50:07.630" style="s2">this place a lot of regenerative work</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.140" end="00:50:10.390" style="s2">land cooperatives and the bank is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.630" end="00:50:13.299" style="s2">interesting too because it&#39;s owned by</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.390" end="00:50:15.940" style="s2">the community and they have eco anion so</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.299" end="00:50:17.349" style="s2">if you want to actually get a loan for</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.940" end="00:50:19.239" style="s2">something and you&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.349" end="00:50:21.309" style="s2">more ecological they&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.239" end="00:50:23.170" style="s2">better rate sometimes when you go in</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.309" end="00:50:25.329" style="s2">there there&#39;ll be a whole lot of trees</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.170" end="00:50:27.400" style="s2">there from the local land care group so</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.329" end="00:50:29.619" style="s2">you go in there to do some banking and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.400" end="00:50:32.950" style="s2">you get some free indigenous trees for</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.619" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">your landscape at the end of the year</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.950" end="00:50:38.650" style="s2">when they&#39;ve got a surplus it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:39.910" style="s2">sucked away somewhere else the community</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.650" end="00:50:42.039" style="s2">decides what they want to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.910" end="00:50:45.099" style="s2">surplus and so when you start to have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.039" end="00:50:48.400" style="s2">sense of control of your view local</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.099" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">money even your local currency of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.400" end="00:50:54.009" style="s2">local food system of connecting with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2">indigenous celebrations that have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.009" end="00:50:58.660" style="s2">going on for a very long time of of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:51:00.339" style="s2">creating communities such as coastal</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.660" end="00:51:02.710" style="s2">waters where eighty-six percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.339" end="00:51:05.109" style="s2">land that this community lives on is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.710" end="00:51:09.009" style="s2">common land so there&#39;s again that sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.109" end="00:51:10.930" style="s2">of Commons and and you know all of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.009" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">has been done consciously over the last</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.930" end="00:51:16.150" style="s2">30 years and the restoration that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:18.830" style="s2">happened in people&#39;s minds as well as in</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:08.069" style="s2">so I have been following the pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.550" end="01:03:09.780" style="s2">that movement you know that how</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.069" end="01:03:12.119" style="s2">blockchain plays a role in democratic</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.780" end="01:03:15.030" style="s2">socialism right and moving shifting</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.119" end="01:03:17.130" style="s2">power back to communities so that it</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.030" end="01:03:19.680" style="s2">enables them to track these things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.130" end="01:03:22.530" style="s2">hyper localize their economy in a way</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.680" end="01:03:23.990" style="s2">that they up they&#39;re empowered don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.530" end="01:03:27.089" style="s2">it&#39;s not just in the hands of some</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.990" end="01:03:29.849" style="s2">company back in Europe or in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.089" end="01:03:32.369" style="s2">somewhere anywhere else so China and</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.849" end="01:03:34.380" style="s2">it&#39;s there they can see it and they have</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.369" end="01:03:36.960" style="s2">an ownership of that economy in front of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.380" end="01:03:38.849" style="s2">them I see it for that I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.960" end="01:03:40.740" style="s2">anyone really fully unpacked that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.849" end="01:03:42.510" style="s2">someone on the panel have seen that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.740" end="01:03:44.579" style="s2">know there are people working on that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.510" end="01:03:46.770" style="s2">but I&#39;m tracking it as it relates to how</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.579" end="01:03:48.630" style="s2">we how we redefine cooperative housing</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.770" end="01:03:51.720" style="s2">cooperative food systems cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.630" end="01:03:52.950" style="s2">mobility cooperative banking in our</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.720" end="01:03:55.049" style="s2">community is an how blockchain can</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.950" end="01:03:58.410" style="s2">enable that facilitate that in a much</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.049" end="01:04:00.420" style="s2">more cost-effective way with power back</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.410" end="01:04:03.030" style="s2">into people&#39;s hands I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.420" end="01:04:04.950" style="s2">briefly comment on that because on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.030" end="01:04:06.930" style="s2">one hand it sounds so wonderful kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.950" end="01:04:09.839" style="s2">using brought blockchain protocols to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.930" end="01:04:12.270" style="s2">create the enabling structures for more</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.270" end="01:04:18.390" style="s2">power back to people but um I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.990" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">tracking the countries like Switzerland</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.390" end="01:04:23.790" style="s2">where where referendums are quite common</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:26.250" style="s2">where a lot of issues are taken to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.790" end="01:04:28.859" style="s2">people and not all of the referendums</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.250" end="01:04:32.069" style="s2">come out with wonderful results like</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.859" end="01:04:34.460" style="s2">they had a referendum against the</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.069" end="01:04:37.980" style="s2">building of mosques in in in Switzerland</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.460" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">and they the reason why I&#39;m mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.980" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">that is that I feel like you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:47.470" style="s2">education if we bring power back to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:50.410" style="s2">people which is absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.470" end="01:04:53.790" style="s2">we also need to do that coupled with</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.410" end="01:04:58.890" style="s2">education because after decades and</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.790" end="01:05:01.570" style="s2">centuries of mass manipulation of media</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.890" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">poisoning the minds of people and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.570" end="01:05:11.320" style="s2">and and most people don&#39;t really want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:13.420" style="s2">spend their days learning and studying</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.320" end="01:05:16.750" style="s2">up on every decision in their local</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.420" end="01:05:18.970" style="s2">region and then vote through blockchain</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.750" end="01:05:21.520" style="s2">on every issue in their region and</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.970" end="01:05:25.030" style="s2">because they won&#39;t this is open for</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.520" end="01:05:28.660" style="s2">demagogues to them very popular in in a</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.660" end="01:05:34.180" style="s2">social media and then rather than having</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.510" end="01:05:37.150" style="s2">equally informed participatory decisions</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.180" end="01:05:42.430" style="s2">at the local level we just get mobs</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.150" end="01:05:44.410" style="s2">being hyped up to go in quickly and just</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.430" end="01:05:46.930" style="s2">press the button to vote and have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.410" end="01:05:49.980" style="s2">voice but they&#39;ve actually not really</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.930" end="01:05:53.859" style="s2">had a voice they&#39;ve been manipulated by</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.980" end="01:05:56.440" style="s2">the social media infrastructure that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.859" end="01:05:58.330" style="s2">playing with our mind so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:06:17.650" end="01:06:23.980" style="s2">deals with this question and of course</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.080" end="01:06:26.020" style="s2">it&#39;s i think this debate often loses</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.980" end="01:06:29.349" style="s2">sight of the fact that democracy is</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.020" end="01:06:32.050" style="s2">essentially a deliberative process it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.349" end="01:06:34.599" style="s2">not just pushing a button and voting</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.050" end="01:06:37.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not about polling that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.599" end="01:06:40.240" style="s2">marketing technique it&#39;s not a a</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.890" end="01:06:43.150" style="s2">democratic technique we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.240" end="01:06:45.790" style="s2">question from Matt who says so many</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.150" end="01:06:47.560" style="s2">regional communities are in stress here</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.790" end="01:06:50.950" style="s2">in eastern Australia we have had</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.560" end="01:06:53.470" style="s2">droughts then fire and now curb it 19</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.950" end="01:06:58.260" style="s2">what skills are needed to be developed</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.470" end="01:06:58.260" style="s2">in regional communities as a whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.690" end="01:07:12.980" style="s2">all jumping first you guys are biting at</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.920" end="01:07:17.900" style="s2">the bit I can see it one thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.980" end="01:07:21.530" style="s2">to add on that map of Australia if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.900" end="01:07:22.520" style="s2">have a look that and if you really go in</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.530" end="01:07:26.530" style="s2">and have a look at it</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.520" end="01:07:29.210" style="s2">yeah the language map of Australia</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.530" end="01:07:31.430" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that all those different</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.210" end="01:07:33.290" style="s2">colors represent different resource</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.430" end="01:07:36.560" style="s2">partitioning and those resource</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.290" end="01:07:39.340" style="s2">partitioning boundaries are basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.560" end="01:07:44.270" style="s2">based on the landscape capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.340" end="01:07:47.930" style="s2">within that local or regional area and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.270" end="01:07:51.890" style="s2">the seasonal functionality of that those</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.930" end="01:07:55.160" style="s2">capabilities yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.890" end="01:07:59.150" style="s2">smart that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.160" end="01:08:01.430" style="s2">where we want to be in in that whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.150" end="01:08:06.860" style="s2">sort of direction</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.430" end="01:08:08.270" style="s2">and you know in eastern Australia yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.860" end="01:08:10.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s essentially you know on</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.270" end="01:08:14.000" style="s2">the coastline where I&#39;m sitting and yes</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.250" end="01:08:17.960" style="s2">you know the the the impacts that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.000" end="01:08:21.830" style="s2">had probably over the last 15 years you</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.960" end="01:08:24.620" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s making its its</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.830" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s forcing people actually to realise</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.620" end="01:08:32.350" style="s2">that you know as humans we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:35.480" style="s2">invincible so at some point in our</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.350" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">intelligence we need to become resilient</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.480" end="01:08:41.660" style="s2">and adaptable and these are the two</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:43.430" style="s2">primary things that yeah indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.660" end="01:08:46.540" style="s2">people throughout Australia in the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.430" end="01:08:49.710" style="s2">we&#39;re able to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.540" end="01:08:52.510" style="s2">as experts was be able to come through</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.710" end="01:08:55.180" style="s2">these natural disasters these climatic</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.510" end="01:08:57.100" style="s2">fluctuations and changes to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.180" end="01:09:01.420" style="s2">manage and control fire on this</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.100" end="01:09:04.569" style="s2">landscape and to utilize it to the to</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.420" end="01:09:06.910" style="s2">the the ability of basically you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.569" end="01:09:11.520" style="s2">turning this whole continent into water</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.910" end="01:09:14.319" style="s2">call like a yeah and another eco garden</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.520" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">where things were so finely tuned and</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:21.760" style="s2">managed that you know you didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:24.790" style="s2">have any fear the fear came from you</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.760" end="01:09:27.250" style="s2">know your actions in harming this</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.790" end="01:09:29.740" style="s2">landscape that&#39;s where the fear came</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.250" end="01:09:31.569" style="s2">from of stepping over the line stepping</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.740" end="01:09:34.780" style="s2">over the boundary of taking and pushing</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.569" end="01:09:36.250" style="s2">too far yeah that&#39;s when the forces</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.780" end="01:09:40.210" style="s2">would come back at you and bite you on</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.250" end="01:09:42.130" style="s2">the bum it wasn&#39;t so much about the fear</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.210" end="01:09:43.720" style="s2">of you know having flood the fear of</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.130" end="01:09:48.280" style="s2">having droughts or the fear of having</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.720" end="01:09:52.569" style="s2">fire in the landscape it was the fear of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.280" end="01:09:55.330" style="s2">overstepping the mark of you know what</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.569" end="01:09:57.670" style="s2">you were doing environmentally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.330" end="01:09:59.800" style="s2">that reason very reason why we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.670" end="01:10:03.070" style="s2">these issues in the first place is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.800" end="01:10:04.690" style="s2">we have overstepped the mark and yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.070" end="01:10:08.920" style="s2">it&#39;s coming back to bite us in the butt</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.690" end="01:10:11.710" style="s2">and yo one of the things when you talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.920" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">about fire yeah if Aboriginal people in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.710" end="01:10:20.260" style="s2">Australia didn&#39;t have to succumb to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:22.240" style="s2">treatment and you know all the horrible</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.260" end="01:10:24.160" style="s2">things that happen in Australia you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.240" end="01:10:28.180" style="s2">we&#39;d still have the landscape that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.160" end="01:10:32.050" style="s2">looked like a immaculate Park or yeah a</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.180" end="01:10:34.660" style="s2">botanical garden it&#39;s when these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.050" end="01:10:37.570" style="s2">this intelligence and when these sort of</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.660" end="01:10:40.020" style="s2">things are shut out of the debate and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.570" end="01:10:43.990" style="s2">shut out of you know the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.020" end="01:10:46.690" style="s2">that things then start to get railroaded</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.990" end="01:10:48.550" style="s2">and overridden by other people&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.690" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">know ideologies and concepts of how the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.550" end="01:10:53.290" style="s2">world and the globe and the planet</p>

<p begin="01:12:35.489" end="01:12:40.929" style="s2">immersed his students in understanding</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.050" end="01:12:42.909" style="s2">you know the whole catchment and I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.929" end="01:12:45.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important part is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.909" end="01:12:48.300" style="s2">that that immersion process of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.610" end="01:12:51.579" style="s2">education you know we can we can create</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.300" end="01:12:54.579" style="s2">technological ways of offering people</p>

<p begin="01:13:02.949" end="01:13:07.059" style="s2">they really get it it&#39;s still always</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.599" end="01:13:08.979" style="s2">just knowing about sustainability or</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.059" end="01:13:11.949" style="s2">knowing about regeneration and in our</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.979" end="01:13:14.619" style="s2">heads we can do it and and I and I was</p>

<p begin="01:13:20.170" end="01:13:25.420" style="s2">meeting with a young young Ladakhi man</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.989" end="01:13:27.190" style="s2">there and he was telling us about the</p>

<p begin="01:13:36.369" end="01:13:40.360" style="s2">spending six days a week in school and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.440" end="01:13:43.030" style="s2">we&#39;re learning how to read and write I</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.360" end="01:13:44.889" style="s2">can the students can write how to make a</p>

<p begin="01:13:44.889" end="01:13:49.030" style="s2">and you boil the water and do all that</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.360" end="01:13:52.030" style="s2">but you know they can&#39;t actually make a</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.030" end="01:13:54.280" style="s2">cup of tea yes I feel the same with that</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.030" end="01:13:56.559" style="s2">you know the sustainability and</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.280" end="01:13:58.540" style="s2">regenerative work like we we can write</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.559" end="01:14:01.119" style="s2">it we know it we read we have great</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.540" end="01:14:03.340" style="s2">theories about it but how will be</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.119" end="01:14:06.429" style="s2">actually living do we know how how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.340" end="01:14:09.099" style="s2">live do we know how to live without the</p>

<p begin="01:14:09.099" end="01:14:13.059" style="s2">are we surrounding ourselves with</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.900" end="01:14:15.969" style="s2">abundance and knowledge about how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.059" end="01:14:17.679" style="s2">have a you know rebuild things if</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.969" end="01:14:19.599" style="s2">something goes wrong you know where is</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.679" end="01:14:21.760" style="s2">that with resilience you know with when</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.599" end="01:14:25.000" style="s2">we make things so efficient and just in</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.760" end="01:14:26.139" style="s2">time there&#39;s there&#39;s not the slack you</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.000" end="01:14:29.110" style="s2">know whereas if you&#39;re surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.139" end="01:14:32.829" style="s2">yourself in a landscape that has that</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.110" end="01:14:35.050" style="s2">level of abundance and robustness and</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.829" end="01:14:37.270" style="s2">you understand how it works and how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.050" end="01:14:39.670" style="s2">fix stuff and how to make things and how</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.270" end="01:14:42.280" style="s2">to plant things and how do you know you</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.670" end="01:14:44.469" style="s2">have a sense of how you can be if</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.280" end="01:14:47.409" style="s2">something goes wrong or who did go to or</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.469" end="01:14:49.599" style="s2">how to manage it and where you know you</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.409" end="01:14:51.639" style="s2">have a deeper sense of what it means to</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.599" end="01:14:55.449" style="s2">be in that place and it isn&#39;t a fearful</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.639" end="01:14:57.010" style="s2">thing and I and and so this emerging</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.449" end="01:15:00.520" style="s2">experience and so that&#39;s why I actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.010" end="01:15:02.650" style="s2">think places like the ecovillages Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.520" end="01:15:03.909" style="s2">there and you know places like crystal</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.650" end="01:15:05.500" style="s2">waters like that they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.909" end="01:15:08.469" style="s2">solution to everything but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.500" end="01:15:11.260" style="s2">places where people can come and dive in</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.469" end="01:15:13.360" style="s2">and really experience what that might</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.260" end="01:15:15.610" style="s2">look like and then start to get the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.360" end="01:15:17.739" style="s2">skills and the thinking to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.610" end="01:15:19.360" style="s2">ripple that out into their own</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.739" end="01:15:21.579" style="s2">neighborhoods in their own communities</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.360" end="01:15:23.469" style="s2">and and I think it&#39;s important I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.579" end="01:15:25.270" style="s2">want everyone you know that the answer</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.469" end="01:15:27.610" style="s2">is not everyone moving out ecovillages</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.270" end="01:15:29.320" style="s2">that would never work I mean we but the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.610" end="01:15:31.270" style="s2">idea is about how do you take the</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.320" end="01:15:32.980" style="s2">lessons from those types of ways of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.270" end="01:15:35.739" style="s2">connecting with place connecting with</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.980" end="01:15:38.679" style="s2">community connecting with culture having</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.739" end="01:15:40.809" style="s2">a deeper sense of what it means to live</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.679" end="01:15:43.710" style="s2">a regenerative life and to understand</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.809" end="01:15:47.070" style="s2">your impact</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.710" end="01:15:50.930" style="s2">and where and how you can meet you back</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.070" end="01:15:53.430" style="s2">basic needs and to be leaving a</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.930" end="01:15:55.110" style="s2">beautiful and abundant life it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.430" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">about going backwards it&#39;s about moving</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.110" end="01:15:59.340" style="s2">forward in a way that that brings all</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:16:02.610" style="s2">the things that are really important and</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.340" end="01:16:05.070" style="s2">will actually enable us to continue and</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.610" end="01:16:06.870" style="s2">that&#39;s where I feel like this the</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.070" end="01:16:12.180" style="s2">education that&#39;s what I focus to a lot</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.870" end="01:16:13.410" style="s2">on on the permute because the education</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.180" end="01:16:15.480" style="s2">that they&#39;re not getting that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.410" end="01:16:20.250" style="s2">getting at the moment is not at all the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.480" end="01:16:21.930" style="s2">type that they need and my daughter 14</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.250" end="01:16:25.860" style="s2">year old girl is just quit school and</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.930" end="01:16:27.390" style="s2">she said it has no it&#39;s there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.860" end="01:16:29.700" style="s2">in there that&#39;s really addressing what</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.390" end="01:16:32.280" style="s2">we need in the world today and I can see</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.700" end="01:16:35.550" style="s2">you know I work a lot with kids Oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.280" end="01:16:39.270" style="s2">courageous I can see a lot of kids who</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.550" end="01:16:41.460" style="s2">are that age 13 14 15 year-olds they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.270" end="01:16:42.719" style="s2">being impacted by hearing everything</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.460" end="01:16:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s going off they watch what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.719" end="01:16:47.370" style="s2">happening you know they&#39;re aware of all</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.400" end="01:16:49.290" style="s2">the climate action there but still then</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.370" end="01:16:52.200" style="s2">they go back into the school system and</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.290" end="01:16:54.360" style="s2">then they just not hearing anything then</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.200" end="01:16:56.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not even learning the SDGs let</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.360" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">alone anything to do with regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.160" end="01:17:01.200" style="s2">Koch designing regenerative cultures so</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:04.340" style="s2">this is where the permute for me is</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.200" end="01:17:07.170" style="s2">coming really strongly I actually had a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.340" end="01:17:09.810" style="s2">I&#39;m as well as linking them together</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.170" end="01:17:12.090" style="s2">with each other around the world they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.810" end="01:17:15.030" style="s2">linking in with refugee groups with</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.090" end="01:17:16.739" style="s2">indigenous groups well I just had had</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.030" end="01:17:19.830" style="s2">them online with Fritjof Capra the other</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.739" end="01:17:21.540" style="s2">day there was a group of them and they</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.830" end="01:17:25.200" style="s2">prepared some questions for fridge offer</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.540" end="01:17:27.750" style="s2">and so we thought you know the systems</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.200" end="01:17:29.580" style="s2">view of life we&#39;re actually going to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.750" end="01:17:31.530" style="s2">a group of young people to try and work</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.580" end="01:17:35.580" style="s2">out how to translate that into something</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.530" end="01:17:37.500" style="s2">that makes sense for them and and so we</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.570" end="01:18:07.170" style="s2">inspiration on that like when I was with</p>

<p begin="01:18:07.170" end="01:18:11.070" style="s2">living we wanted all schools should be</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.059" end="01:18:13.920" style="s2">living buildings right so the immersion</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.070" end="01:18:16.230" style="s2">that the building represents the kind of</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.230" end="01:18:20.039" style="s2">next generation so there&#39;s a school we</p>

<p begin="01:18:20.039" end="01:18:23.940" style="s2">through it you know water was there</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.960" end="01:18:26.849" style="s2">they&#39;re growing food so the students had</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.940" end="01:18:28.170" style="s2">to learn how to grow their own food but</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.849" end="01:18:29.460" style="s2">just because it was in a city that was</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.170" end="01:18:31.800" style="s2">the beam I was trying to break that</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.460" end="01:18:34.590" style="s2">bring that natural environment by likley</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.800" end="01:18:36.059" style="s2">into the school so that they were using</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.590" end="01:18:38.010" style="s2">so you know everything around them was</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.059" end="01:18:41.730" style="s2">any normal solar panel told energy</p>

<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:58.219" style="s2">and being immersed in the living world</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.489" end="01:19:00.900" style="s2">maybe this I&#39;d rather my kids spend</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.219" end="01:19:03.139" style="s2">three months up with gels and learning a</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.889" end="01:19:13.139" style="s2">there&#39;s so much disconnection between</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.280" end="01:19:16.559" style="s2">understanding the teenager the young</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.139" end="01:19:19.770" style="s2">brain and its development space and how</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.559" end="01:19:21.469" style="s2">we teach them this new worldview I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.770" end="01:19:23.550" style="s2">that book is going to be incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.469" end="01:19:25.409" style="s2">awesome to reinterpret it through the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.550" end="01:19:32.880" style="s2">lens of a teenager I mean they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.409" end="01:19:35.520" style="s2">amazing and we need yours my next one</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.880" end="01:19:38.539" style="s2">too Daniel would be I have I have them</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.520" end="01:19:42.389" style="s2">all stacked up here then it&#39;s that one</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.539" end="01:19:45.210" style="s2">and this one from worried you know Rob</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.389" end="01:19:47.460" style="s2">Hopkins so these are the this is these</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.210" end="01:19:50.219" style="s2">are the new textbooks I believe for</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.460" end="01:19:52.889" style="s2">their where we need our young people to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.219" end="01:19:55.079" style="s2">be focusing on and of course this</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.889" end="01:19:57.900" style="s2">discussion draws attention to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.079" end="01:20:00.420" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just about young people I</p>

<p begin="01:20:08.190" end="01:20:14.400" style="s2">talked you mentioned just in time</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:17.610" style="s2">approaches to management we&#39;ve succeeded</p>

<p begin="01:20:21.210" end="01:20:26.190" style="s2">efficient and of course from that point</p>

<p begin="01:20:32.969" end="01:20:38.989" style="s2">there&#39;s so much redundancy in nature and</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.730" end="01:20:42.420" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what creates resilience</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.989" end="01:20:43.949" style="s2">Daniel there was a question for you and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.420" end="01:20:48.599" style="s2">it might have to be the last question</p>
