<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">i think something that happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">last stoa session when it opened</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">to questions um and someone was</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">describing</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">anxiety attacks and i was sharing things</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">that have been useful for me around that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">various personal topics is uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:17.840" style="s2">that&#39;s really fun it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">fun to get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.840" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">address philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">practices that could be useful at a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">cultural and civilizational scale in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">context of just what&#39;s actually alive</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">and real questions real dialogue rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">than just in the theory</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">uh place and with specific topics so</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">most of the time if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">on a podcast it is to share some</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">topical body of content and so uh the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">of making a space to have no topic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">just address what&#39;s alive for people</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">sounded uh fun and worthwhile and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">it would probably end up surfacing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">conversations that don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:00.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m looking forward to seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.400" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">awesome um and i sent a google uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">um doc for taking notes i didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">who&#39;s going to take notes but someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">jumping in and taking a lead on that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">which is awesome</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">and so the idea here is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">have um each session we&#39;ll take notes so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">we can have a body of knowledge that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">can uh work with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">um so the first question that i have and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">basically asked it to in the chats um</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">maybe if you um feel up for it to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:27.039" style="s2">describe the consilience project</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">again because i know you introduced it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.039" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">publicly at rebel wisdom recently under</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">their war of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">and you and i have been chatting uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">about it for a last little while</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">and someone had a question um related to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">uh how can a place a digital campfire</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">like this though help with this project</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">so maybe like a one-on-one on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">project and how can we help with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">i think i won&#39;t explain the concept</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">project from scratch since there</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">are a couple videos that do that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">someone can just check it out and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">want to take a bunch of time covering</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">that since i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">many people heard it but the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:08.240" style="s2">overall is seeking to facilitate a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">development in culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.240" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">where people have increasing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">value around both their own better sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">making of the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.479" style="s2">and their ability to sense make other</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">people&#39;s perspective experience and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">sense making and communicate effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">so that we might be better able to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">coordinated problem solving for the big</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">problems that we care about that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">not doing a very good job with currently</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.800" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">and uh making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on with climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">change and environmental issues whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">hard by itself like the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">those is tricky</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">but then to also make sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">that&#39;s connected to geopolitical issues</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">and market issues and other things based</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">one strategy that benefits a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">could harm something else</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">and different sub-populations are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">focused on different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">overall landscape that they care about</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">that requires pretty deep sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">of not just</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">complex issues but how lots of complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">issues are interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">and how lots of other people are making</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.440" style="s2">sense of it valuing it how they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">to respond to get a sense of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">actually move forward together</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">and if everything that we do elicits a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">counter response that is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">counter the things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of arms race of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">escalation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">effective counter responses the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">coordination cost is too high to really</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">solve any</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">of our major problems and we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:34.160" style="s2">actually driving</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">arms race in conflict in the process</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.160" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">so a cultural value around both better</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">and more holistic and integrated sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">making and better communication so we</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">can coordinate particularly with people</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">that see things differently</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">than we do because we have to because we</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.800" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">inhabit the planet we just because we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">disagree with them and call them stupid</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they stop existing and stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:57.199" style="s2">um that&#39;s kind of the cultural set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.199" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">and stoicism as like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">uh schools of greek philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">had a lot to do with how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.199" style="s2">increase our self-awareness and our</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.199" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">resilience so that we are not as easily</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">hijacked by</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">group think and narrative warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">emotional reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">that we can actually reflect on our</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">values and our sense-making and make</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">good choices from that place</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">and so if you take that as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">you know one of those schools that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">co-occurring with more</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">of the kind of aristotelian pythagorean</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">type schools of can we can we get logic</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">better can we get science and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">empirical observation better and with</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">the kind of socratic dialogue type</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">school</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">can we have better quality conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">and understand each other better</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">if i can understand myself understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">others understand base reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">communicate effectively across those the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.160" style="s2">whole population can do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">we have a much better chance of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:04.320" style="s2">in something like collective problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.839" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">solving or governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.320" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">so considering this project has certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">things that we&#39;re going to do directly</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">in terms of types of education and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:11.279" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">that we put out to try to help make</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.279" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">sense of current world events and teach</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">people how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s also seeking to facilitate the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">cultural movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:22.959" style="s2">towards these goals</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">writ large which means every project</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.959" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">that is trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">better digital tools for helping people</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">search data sets and make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">things or better news projects or better</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">public education projects or better</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">has the ability to be a place where</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">somebody can learn an epistemic tool and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">then say okay well what does this</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">actually look like how do i generate a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">landscape of all of the narratives on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">particular topic how do we steal man</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">how do we then move from steel manning a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">narrative to trying to actually</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">tons of questions and they&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">probably come at you from different</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">okay it&#39;s a long one bear with me um in</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">my industry there&#39;s a pattern common in</p>

<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">makers have a great deal of capital and</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">matches</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">the pattern that i see across many</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">so the question is for those who are low</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">in the hierarchical stack</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">what can we do to be more effective in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">making systemic change when</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">the owners of capital have other ends</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:30.079" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great pretty perennial</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">social organization question uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.079" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different answers right</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">unions historically have been an</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">answer let&#39;s be able to get those people</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">into some unionized force that has</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">with um capital ownership</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:46.640" style="s2">democracy has been an answer so forming</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">a union in the private sector is one</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.640" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">forming a public sector where we say</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">let&#39;s make a government of foreign by</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">the people that actually has a monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">of force even bigger</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">than the top of the private sector</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">capital ownership that can enforce rule</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">of law that&#39;s another answer but of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">capital will end up capturing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">regulatory body</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">if the people are not fully educated</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">informed and engaged and actively being</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">the regulatory body and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">most nobody here probably is engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:18.000" style="s2">all that often as a citizen so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">of for and by the people governance it</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.000" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">permanent political class largely</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">captured by an economic</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">class and people that have other [ __ ] to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:27.680" style="s2">do and then complain about bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">government but are consenting to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.680" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">governed by rulers by not being actively</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">engaged in their own self-determination</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">um so there&#39;s a lot of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">of answers right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">politics would be one answer unionizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">would be another answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">getting better at the game of power</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">inside of the private sector is another</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">so figure out how to ladder climb more</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">effectively so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">influence things by being in the c-suite</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">or in the board or</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">do a better job at capital accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">so that you can influence things as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">shareholder or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">what i would say is true across all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">another would be create public education</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">to change consumer demands</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">right so that the customers are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">demanding something different so supply</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">has to create something different</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">because there&#39;s a change in demand</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">so those are all classic answers right</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">but what i would say that they all have</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">in common</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">and other ones that we could give is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:33.200" style="s2">that in addition to the intelligence one</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">might have about the topic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.200" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">strategic</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">intelligence that also has to be there</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.200" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">the strategic intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">doing like what we&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">what are the different ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">to be able to influence what are ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">that i could do</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">what are ways that i could move into</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">increasing influence</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t corrupt the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and in this given situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">of the various pathways which ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">actually make no sense and are most</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">actualizable by the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">asking it and so what i would say is if</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">be more influential because you believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">that you have sense making that should</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">be more coupled to choice making</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">then you actually have to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">kind of intelligence not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:16.240" style="s2">sense-making intelligence but the kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.240" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">of how influence itself works</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">could you expand on that last point just</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">when i say how influence works you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.519" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">say how power works</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">which is also synonymous with how</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">strategy works</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.160" style="s2">right which is what i&#39;m saying by</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">strategic intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.160" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">okay if the if there&#39;s a game of power</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">rooted in things like private property</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.160" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">ownership is</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">a uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">my ability as a person or a family or a</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">corporation or a nation to advance my</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">balance sheet independent of or even at</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">the expense of others of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">and there is all kinds of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">to get more capital accumulation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">have that capital in service of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">generating more capital</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s scarcity of resource and as</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">a result of scarcity of resource driving</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">value there&#39;s a basis to artificial</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">artificially manufacture more scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">if i happen to be doing well at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">as you as you understand those types of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">dynamics the underlying conflict theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">then you say okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:42.079" style="s2">those who get those who figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">say we started a market t equals zero</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.079" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">everyone has the exact same amount of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">resource and position</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">people won&#39;t be equally good at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">thing right some people</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">um partly because of luck but partly</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">because of orientation and aptitude and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">will start to get more resources in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">system and as soon as they have more</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">they have more capacity to generate more</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">resources they can employ more people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">they can do more to affect the mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">of other people through media they can</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">influence government</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:12.079" style="s2">through lobbying more they can apply</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">they can contract private intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.079" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">they can make sure their kids get the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">best education</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">whatever right so if someone gets more</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:22.560" style="s2">they both have the incentive and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">capacity to protect that asymmetry of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.560" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">resource and grow it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">so then you end up getting a power law</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:29.040" style="s2">distribution and wealth and that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">being an inexorable thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">power law distribution so then you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">okay well if i&#39;m not at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:34.959" style="s2">power law distribution what do i</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">what do i do if i want to influence this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">we&#39;ll either have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">get up there</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a certain kind of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">insight how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">what what what are the ways to actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">or i have to say so there&#39;s a power law</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">distribution in economic wealth what are</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">the other things that could affect that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">if i&#39;m down here i don&#39;t have cemetery</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:55.759" style="s2">of power up here so i don&#39;t have real</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.759" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">but if i got all of us together so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">that&#39;s say all of us as workers which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">a union or all of us</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">as consumers which could create an</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">influence on supply side so can i do</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">consumer education</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.959" style="s2">or all of us forming a government that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">could then bind this with rule of law</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.959" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">um or can i build a technology</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">that increases my power through leverage</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">right so these are basically strategic</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.199" style="s2">insights</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">around how do i how does the game of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.199" end="00:17:27.199" style="s2">power work</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">and in the presence of that being the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">thing that is determining what happens</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">largely if i have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">that there are better things that could</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">happen how do i</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">also develop the capability</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">to see what the pathways to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">any influence are now how one studies</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">so that i mean you can study military</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:52.880" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">which is a very good thing to study you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.880" end="00:17:55.679" style="s2">can study game theory and study</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">coordination there you can study</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.679" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">psychology you can study the biographies</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">of self-made successful</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">people you can study</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">types of asymmetric technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">for the most part anyone who gets good</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">at the game of power also gets captured</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">by</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">freedom in agency are also the most</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">to keep doing the kinds of things that</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">so like it&#39;s you can</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:47.600" style="s2">the presence of the pressures that nato</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">and the us were giving and the economic</p>

<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:54.559" style="s2">have really done something all that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.559" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">right in the presence of ubiquitous game</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">theory you either get good enough to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">protect your people and do your thing or</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:03.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t and you end up losing to</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.360" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">and so you can see that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">seem like they have the most power are</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">the most obligated to behave in certain</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">given that position</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.679" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">and for the most part those who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.200" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">pursuing power are doing it because of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">psychological dispositions to pursue</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">and so then if there are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">psychologically not disposed to try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">get power</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">and those who influence it have</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:41.919" style="s2">given up really caring for the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">or become completely</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">and that means that anyone who has been</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.120" style="s2">how can you actually get better at games</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">of power while still remaining game b</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">is the extent to which they can be safe</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s the need for like there has</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">to be an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">high value on what you actually value</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">and a value on integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">impeccability</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">to motivate you to have enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">self-inquiry to be looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">adjusting those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">oftentimes like it was easier when</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">someone believed in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">all-seeing punishing and rewarding god</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">because then there&#39;s a motive to be</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">not one jot not one tittle shall go</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">unjudged before the day of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">but if i don&#39;t believe in a judging god</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">then why not get away with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">that i could get away with</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">if i&#39;m the only one who knows and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">so then there&#39;s a question of do i</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">actually have a sense of what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">beyond just what is that personally</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">that is deep enough that i have a basis</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:27.360" style="s2">for self-respect</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">that requires integrity that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.360" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">require integrity of myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">uh the deeper that process is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">the more someone can be a safe vessel</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">for power</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">and then trusted people around you that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:45.279" style="s2">can check you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">most people who get into positions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">power get surrounded by yes men who all</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">want something from them</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">and as a result continue to say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">things that double down on the bias that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">brought the person there</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">um if you are earnest in your desire</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">to wield influence for</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">actual collective good then you should</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">there are blind spots in yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:11.840" style="s2">can&#39;t see and there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">collective intelligence that exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.840" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">your own intelligence about what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">right and so you should be actively</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">seeking that collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">about the situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">and actively seeking it about your own</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">self now that doesn&#39;t you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">very careful of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:30.320" style="s2">who do you trust who they are as people</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re knowing of you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.840" style="s2">enough that you&#39;re really seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">share enough with them that they can</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">give you that reflection but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the compliment daniel</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:11.760" style="s2">something like that being much harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">you can do the hard thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.760" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">if it&#39;s the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">right if kinder heart</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:20.799" style="s2">makes you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">so sensitive to that person that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">going to make a choice that would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">better for lots of people in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">then the kindness is actually myopic</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">if you on the other side rationalize</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">this is the right choice for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t feel any empathy for</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">that person and you don&#39;t take any</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">considerations around it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">then you also become deadened and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a dangerousness in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">so i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">i want to care about the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">that person and if i have to let them go</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">i want to feel that but i also don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">want my feeling that to make me myopic</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">and not make the choice that is in</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">service of the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">uh i have a follow-up that you can swat</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.440" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">and it has to do with your personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">relationship with power</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">um especially when you&#39;ve you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">gaining</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">increase of influence and your voice is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">is getting heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">um is there any moments in your life</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">where you felt like you were in a wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">relationship with power</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">and what did you do to correct that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">maybe what kind of ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:36.159" style="s2">or relationships you have in order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">keep you in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:38.480" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">i grew up nearly maximally blind</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">to power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">and that was partly because of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">homeschooled with no kids around like</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">even just the nature of school</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">school yard stuff and clicks and bowling</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">and whatever i just i didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">and because of the great fortune of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:13.200" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.240" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">like reading a lot and as a kid but</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.200" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">being exposed to good things so i was um</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">reading the works of a lot of the great</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">philosophers that those were actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">the people i was being exposed to and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">that&#39;s how i thought people were</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">it was very strange because there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.880" style="s2">this there was this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">cognitive dissonance that i didn&#39;t learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.880" end="00:28:38.399" style="s2">until later where because then i got</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">involved in activism and i saw factory</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.399" end="00:28:41.279" style="s2">farms and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">just instantly wanted to kill all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.279" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">would do anything like a factory farm i</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">saw the the yulin dog meat festival and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">i just wanted to remove that part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">so i knew or study</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">uh how creative we&#39;ve gotten with</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">torture methods</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">so i knew that there was gruesome abuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">of power in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">but i was on the outside of it looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">and the few people that i was relating</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">with were also on the outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">looking at it so then i had this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">default</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">that whenever i was talking to someone i</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">assumed they weren&#39;t part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been conditioned by it because we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">were only ever talking about solving</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">world problems because the only thing i</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.200" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">because they were interested in that i</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">assumed that we were kind of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">this thing together</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.279" style="s2">so i ended up trusting people i</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have trusted</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.279" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">and then having projects be harmed as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">result of that because i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">seeing the highest in people and wanting</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">to be redemptive all of the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">and um and creating an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">the only the highest values and the more</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">what were being talked about because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">nature of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">and then i also had people assuming i</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">was playing games of power</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:02.399" style="s2">who were more power literate because</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t believe that i was as</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.399" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">educated as i was about say sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">i was as stupid as i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">about the game of power and i just i</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">just had a very uneven development that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">and so then they would say you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:14.799" style="s2">naivete signaling right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">assuming that i actually knew the game</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.799" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">of power and i was signaling being naive</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">to it as a method of playing the game of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">power effectively</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">um and i was just like what the [ __ ] are</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">you talking about i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">it was very it was disheartening and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">frustrating and so then i&#39;m like okay i</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">have to understand this so</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">then it was finally time to read</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">machiavelli and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">um robert green and all like that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">and even then there was still an</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">outsideness where i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">okay so i understand those dynamics but</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">anybody who i&#39;m talking to about those</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">dynamics is uh and so it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">progressive process</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">for me i also had this thing where</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">it made so much sense and i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">grateful for it and yet it also</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">seems so naive and silly to me now</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">when i when i was a kid and for kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">most of my growing up i never</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">asked what do i want to do with my life</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">i asked what does the world need and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:16.159" style="s2">what should humanity do from kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.159" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">omniscient perspective right and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">was very useful because i</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">i thought i couldn&#39;t figure out what i</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">should do if i don&#39;t have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">what humanity needs</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">like i&#39;m embedded in this thing i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">part of it so i need to figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">but that meant that i i wasn&#39;t thinking</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:34.799" style="s2">in terms of my own agency of what i</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">could affect</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.799" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">so i was i had was thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">sense-making of what would make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:45.519" style="s2">decoupled from the how do we get there</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">that was both extremely useful and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.519" end="00:31:50.240" style="s2">extremely naive</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">and so then had to get into the okay so</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.240" end="00:31:54.399" style="s2">the enactment problem we can&#39;t just do</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">this and that perfect world system comes</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.399" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">about even if we get some people to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:58.159" style="s2">agree how do we deal with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.159" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">people who don&#39;t agree to the non-uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:03.679" style="s2">nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:05.120" style="s2">proliferation agreement and who build</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.679" end="00:32:06.720" style="s2">all the nukes end up in running the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.120" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">world how how do we deal with those</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.720" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">types of issues</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">and then there was like a begrudging</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">that the path from if you will game a to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">requires capacity in both</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">it is neither game a nor is it game b</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">game a for game a sake is to win at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">game of power</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">for the purpose of the game of power</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">game b to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">played in full requires that being the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">game or the context and it&#39;s not yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">so that how do we move from where we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">to there requires being</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">able to not be beat by game a right</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">understanding it while actually not</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">seeking to serve its aims but seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:54.799" style="s2">change the nature of the game itself and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">so that that that&#39;s a little part of um</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">history with it and then uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">finding people who i think understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">topics better than i do</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">and seeking their input and particularly</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">finding people understand topics better</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">than i do</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">who disagree with each other and trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:26.799" style="s2">understand their perspectives more and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.799" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">where they agree and where they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">and why</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">uh across topics this has always been</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">something super important to me</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">and very helpful and then also</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.720" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">i think i used to err in the side of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">seeking people&#39;s feedback</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">for my own growth too much because</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">it was because i knew that anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">feedback about me has some value even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:57.760" style="s2">it&#39;s largely their own trigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">there&#39;s still the question of why didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.760" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">i have the attunement to know that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.080" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">be triggering to them how could i have</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">communicated more effectively to them</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:05.919" style="s2">right there&#39;s going to be signal in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">even if what they&#39;re saying is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.919" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">objectively true</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s assuming that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">communicating in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">which i came to recognize is not a fair</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">thing to assume all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">and it takes a lot of time because</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s not all equally valuable so</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">then starting to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to be more selective in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:30.000" style="s2">uh not who agree with me but who i</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">both their good faith and earnestness</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">and their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">and be seeking their input</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an awesome heuristic i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">to sneak in a follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">so something that we&#39;re looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">to doing at the store eventually to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">develop courses</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">and one that you know i think is as neat</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">as having a power literacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">uh course and as i mentioned to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:56.159" style="s2">robert greene the laws of power is</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">coming to the store soon</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.159" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">uh where he&#39;s agreed to come on at least</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">and you mentioned like studying game</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">theory the great great people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">achieved power is there any one single</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">source that you know of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">that has the most bang for your buck</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">when it comes to uh understanding power</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:19.280" style="s2">probably robert green okay i mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">what he did in the 33 strategies of war</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.280" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">and the 48 laws</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">was take a lot of the classics of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">theory or political theory and break</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">them into fairly simple principles and</p>

<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">and doing it in a popular way where you</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">really understand um</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">what this particular period and prussian</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">history was about to get the cultural</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">way or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">as far as an intro i think those are</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">probably the best intros</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">the thing i&#39;ve noticed about them is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">most of the people who i have seen read</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">them</p>

<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">because it you know there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">something like a game a game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">context there there isn&#39;t something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">the problem</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">looking at history of what won and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">understand the thing that wins</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">and even in the introduction there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">um the only thing that wins is the game</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">of power and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">so if you have any ethics or virtue at</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">all you better get good at the game of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:46.320" style="s2">because otherwise you won&#39;t be effective</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">which is not all that different than</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.320" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">something i just said</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">but there&#39;s this subtle thing where it</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">can actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">someone can interpret that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">rationalizes sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">and utilitarianism in general can</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">make you rationalize sociopathy hey i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">doing this for this good reason so i</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">don&#39;t feel bad about the thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:07.119" style="s2">harming</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">one of the problems with utilitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.119" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">is my</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">modeling of the future to say if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">do this this will happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">usually is more i&#39;m assuming more</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">certainty than is actually warranted</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:22.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s on the basis of that false</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">excessive</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.320" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">certainty that i rationalize the harm</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">that i cause</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">if we don&#39;t do this thing then china</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">will do this thing well</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">there&#39;s like 20 steps of unknown stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.480" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">but assuming that thing to be certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">and true</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">then i do a one-step certain harm</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:44.480" style="s2">causing now</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">and this is tricky this is where virtue</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.480" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">ethics are needed to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">um offset utilitarian ethics you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.880" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">be doing both you have to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">about the process</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">and the results and the recursion</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">there was a question that was bubbling</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">up in me uh wanting to inquire about</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">your thoughts on power relating to evil</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">but maybe i&#39;ll put that on pause and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">throw another question too and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">can decide which one resonates more</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">uh up in the chat someone was mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">what was it again uh sexual selection</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">how that question</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">uh uh was sort of dodged on the eric</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">weinstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">uh podcaster appearance that the person</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">who said it was evaded i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">listened to that one</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:28.160" style="s2">and then the previous stoa session you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">said you might address it at a different</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">appearance which is related to power</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">sexual selection dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">um so i&#39;ll throw that out for you the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:42.960" style="s2">um so the question is uh do you uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">so i&#39;ll read what the person said daniel</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.960" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">evaded answering question on sexual</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">selection on both eric&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">and previous stoa sessions how does</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">sexual selection impact game a</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">so i can give you my sense of what a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">answer is which is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:23.839" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:24.480" style="s2">the most ethical game a answers are</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.839" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.480" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">different axiom sets are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.839" style="s2">us answer that differently</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">so from an evolutionary bio perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">evolution is the result of mutation</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:44.960" style="s2">survival and mating</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">right some mutations end up being more</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.960" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">successful at surviving and mating they</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">go through</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">and then you get recombinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">dynamics in the mating of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">ones that were able to survive and mate</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">and that that process</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">and so there&#39;s obviously a strong</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">impulse to survive and a strong impulse</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">mate and a strong impulse to mate with</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:08.839" style="s2">whatever else looks like</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">is also evolutionarily maximal mating</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.839" end="00:40:11.839" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">and so a lot of people take conflict</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">theory down to this level</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">either the malthusian thing on survival</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:27.119" style="s2">humans reproduce geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">resources reproduce arithmetically</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">eventually there will be more people</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">than there are resources than scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">of resource for survival of drives</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">inexorable competition over over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">not everyone can attain the same stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a survival selection</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:45.119" style="s2">answer and it&#39;s it&#39;s wrong by the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">though</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.119" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">uh it makes all the sense in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">why malthus said it</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">at the time but when he said humans</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">reproduce geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">that was before the inflection curves in</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">population that really started to happen</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">where populations were going down</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">without exogenous pressures</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">and we can see in the nordic countries</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">and in japan and in wealthier places the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">population curves have stabilized and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">even went down without exogenous</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:11.359" style="s2">pressures</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">and it was also before us getting the</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.359" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">ability to create a closed-loop material</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">economy and recycle stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">and upcycle stuff so we don&#39;t end up</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">needing</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">more resource that is only reproducing</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">arithmetically forever</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:29.520" style="s2">we can upcycle it so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">that insight um needs amended</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.520" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">and then when it comes to mate selection</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a similar thing like</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">if i assume monogamy is the social</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.560" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">contra</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">construct um and specifically for</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">mating and that everyone has a</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">it was a way to ensure that all the men</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">got to mate</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:51.680" style="s2">and so they had to when they were young</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">kind of posture</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">do whatever peacocking they needed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">land a mate but then once they had it</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">you had some social convention where all</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">the guys got to have a sexual and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:02.480" style="s2">procreative opportunity and then they</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">weren&#39;t gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.480" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">more and as a result if i knew you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">weren&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">gonna try to mate with my wife then we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">could coordinate together where if i</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that you weren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">try that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">then i have to always stay in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">competition with you</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">and if there&#39;s a bunch of men who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">getting their mating needs met they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">just break the civilization because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">not meeting their needs so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">make it to where all the men have their</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">base need met and then stop competing</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">with each other because they kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">the thing they need</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">now of course that is an idealized</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">version that pretends that adultery</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">wasn&#39;t ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">um and you know etc but uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">my game b answer is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.359" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">that the sexual impulse i mean and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">is true even in monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">in monogamy there&#39;s the recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">you will have sexual impulse towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">people other than the person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">married to that you&#39;re going to witness</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">and not act on</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:06.000" style="s2">right so there is this recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">you don&#39;t act on every impulse</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.000" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">and that there are some choices that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">lead to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">a healthy life in a healthy society and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">there are other impulses that don&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">you have the capacity to have some</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">volitional</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:20.839" style="s2">override on i would say that we can just</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">extend</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.839" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">that um but it&#39;s that same</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">kind of principle and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">polyamory there&#39;s a similar extension</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">i can witness my jealousy impulse</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">and not be controlled by it in the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">way i can witness my promiscuity impulse</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">and not be controlled by it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">can i gain increasing sovereignty over</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:47.040" style="s2">my being hijacked by sexual desire</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">and being hijacked by rivalrous desire</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.040" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">or any of those things can i gain the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">ability to witness all of them and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">be automatically controlled</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">so that my virtues and values can</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">actually be the basis of my choice</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">and i would say whether we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">monogamous a polyamorous</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">a mixed whatever kind of set of social</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:08.960" style="s2">constructs</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">the basis of it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">and i think here&#39;s the core argument and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">this is why i actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a limit to evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">psychology that</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:29.359" style="s2">i end up being unhappy with</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">the answers it generates all the time is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.359" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">we have capacities that were not</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">evolutionarily selected for directly</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">but are the exceptions of what was</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">selected for</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">right so nature selected for</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">the capacity for recursive abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">because it led to tool building and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">coordination for hunting but</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">now that recursive abstraction gives us</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">the ability to do things that were not</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">part of our evolutionary selective</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">environment but we have the capacity so</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.920" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">default that they will be deployed that</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.839" style="s2">way but it&#39;s possible for us to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">them that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.839" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">and if we if we look in</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">the rest of nature other than humans on</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">this biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">we are we are really not like anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">in the amount of impact that we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">on all of the ecosystems that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:22.960" style="s2">and the nature and the speed the speed</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">coupling in particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.960" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">so mostly we don&#39;t compare ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.079" style="s2">viruses or mycelium we compare ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">to apex predators</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">and i think people here have heard me</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">talk about this before apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">theory is not a good model for humans</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">because orcas can&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">the ocean and go hunt on land and polar</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:46.960" style="s2">bears can&#39;t go hunting the savannah we</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">were able to become the apex predator in</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.960" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">every environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">so rather than hunt to a certain level</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">and then have our population checked</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">they also didn&#39;t start factory farms</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">they also didn&#39;t do species extinction</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">at scale</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">because and i mean i&#39;ve used this</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:02.960" style="s2">example so many times but an orc is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">going to catch</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.960" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">one seal or one fish at a time and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">going to miss a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">and then you look at a drift net a mile</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">long drift net that pulls up</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">a hundred thousand fish at once and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">you&#39;re like that&#39;s not apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">right like that dwarfs and orca&#39;s impact</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">on fish populations</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">so much that it&#39;s incomparable so if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">modeling ourselves as apex predators and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">needing to up regulate</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">people so we have to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">our exponential technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">domination and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">whatever to compete with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">we do destroy we both drive arms races</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">where the direct conflict is bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:44.480" style="s2">the playing field can handle and where</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">the externality is bigger than the</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:50.720" style="s2">so the thing i would say is that our</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.559" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">choice making capacities because of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">abstraction and technology</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">are evolutionarily unprecedented no</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">other animals</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">can impact the world in the way we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">as a result of that our evolutionary or</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">our choice making basis has to also be</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">evolutionarily unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">and it can be um</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">and so our capacity to witness</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">evolutionary impulses in ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">neither automatically be controlled by</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">shame them just witness them understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">them and then have a choice-making basis</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">that is more the result of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:32.839" style="s2">um reflection abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.680" end="00:48:35.680" style="s2">values consideration is key to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.839" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.680" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">um so feel free to swat this one away</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m being playfully</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">nosey today um but when it comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">the monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">poly kind of distinction</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">how do you relate to that what was your</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">sort of pathway</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">and your choice</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">i have been happily monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve been happily polyamorous i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">happily celibate it was important for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">to explore</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">be with nobody be with one person be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">with more than one person</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">so that i had first person experience of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">it i had</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">knowledge of it and that it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">a choice</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">because if i couldn&#39;t do some of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:21.520" style="s2">then it wasn&#39;t really a choice it was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">default if</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.520" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">my jealousy was so intense that um</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">my partner being with someone else would</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">really freak me out make me lose my [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">and then when i say i&#39;m choosing</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">monogamy because of this that and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">other value that&#39;s really the rational</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:38.400" style="s2">backfill</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:42.079" style="s2">to i just can&#39;t handle something else um</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.400" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">or similarly if i couldn&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.079" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">monogamy because i&#39;m super afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">being trapped and afraid of commitments</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:47.680" style="s2">and can&#39;t control lust processes and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">whatever then i</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.680" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">say i&#39;m choosing the other one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">a default so it was important to me to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">have experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:55.839" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:00.559" style="s2">that i can navigate i could navigate</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">different models right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.559" end="00:50:03.599" style="s2">i could navigate different cultural</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">models but</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">who am i as a being and showing up to</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">relationships with other people is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">deeper than the models</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">and does my okayness</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">come from a specific model does it come</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">from the agreement that this person will</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">never behave in these ways and if they</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:20.559" style="s2">do i&#39;m totally [ __ ] up or that i</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">you know get the opportunity to behave</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">with these people in these ways or does</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">it come from a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">place than that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">so i can&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">at this point</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.960" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">i can&#39;t really imagine being bothered by</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">who someone chose to have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">like that&#39;s just not gonna bother me i</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">also can&#39;t imagine feeling like i need</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">to have sex with somebody in particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:52.839" style="s2">um and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">those are just not things that control</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.839" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">and that means that there is not a</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">a particular model of i need to get my</p>

<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:06.839" style="s2">i think coming to relationships from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">point of view and this is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">u.s california um</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">personal development language of like</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">i think it it can actually go in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">pretty bad direction</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:28.400" style="s2">which is hey i have these needs we&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">something else would occur if that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:55.359" style="s2">was doing that thing that you really</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.359" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">to something else and got distracted</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;d be fine</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the but as soon as i say i need</p>

<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">conditionalizing my happiness and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">i&#39;m making that true</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">for myself now of course i might have</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">i know the kinds of things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.119" style="s2">interested in and if someone doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.079" end="00:52:16.400" style="s2">want to do the kinds of things i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.119" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">interested in it just doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.400" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">sense for us to do this thing together</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">like i&#39;m i&#39;m interested in relationships</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">where we&#39;re honest and if</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:26.079" style="s2">someone else is not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.280" style="s2">honesty or not capable of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.079" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;m just not going to choose to do a</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m not saying i need you to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">honest with me</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">so i think the coming to a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">from a place of sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">not from a place of seeking to get your</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">needs met in it is a critical part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">navigating</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">are times where</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">i think there are things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">learned in celibacy</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">differently i won&#39;t say they&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">way to learn it</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">but they can be learned differently than</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">through other</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">life experiences i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.720" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">they&#39;re all of the kind of tantric</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">of notice sexual energy arise</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">and see if you can learn how to move it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">see if you can learn how to direct that</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">and direct it in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:53:59.839" style="s2">to creativity and to other things</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">there&#39;s really interesting stuff one has</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.839" end="00:54:02.000" style="s2">to do when they don&#39;t just go to</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">immediate release</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.000" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">of a very strong evolutionary energy</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">there&#39;s also something around when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">meditate and your nose itches and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">don&#39;t scratch it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">you just witness it which says i am not</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">controlled by every biologic impulse</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">that arises i don&#39;t have to scratch it</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:21.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll be fine if it just itches and i</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">watch it there&#39;s something around</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.839" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">if i can watch a very strong sexual</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">impulse and not have to scratch the itch</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">i become more trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">including more trustworthy to myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">there&#39;s also a place of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">have a lot more attention with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">that can make you both more reflective</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">and more noticing and integrating shadow</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:54.160" style="s2">and all kinds of things like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">when you don&#39;t put a huge amount of your</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.160" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">attention on other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">and when you aren&#39;t seeking to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">fulfillment from other people right away</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:03.200" style="s2">but seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">notice your where unfulfillment arises</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.200" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">inside of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">and inquire more into it and work with</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of wholeness and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">sovereignty that can be developed that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">and specifically if someone is coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">from codependence</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">sometimes that phase is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">it&#39;s actually necessary before getting</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">to interdependence to go through a phase</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">of deep independence that involves even</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">things like sexual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">um monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">uh in forests one of his landry is one</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">of his books there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">line that i think is just beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:47.920" style="s2">expressed that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">the line is uh for every freedom</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.920" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">multiple</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.640" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">new limits arise and for every limit</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">multiple new freedoms arise</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">and this is the recognition that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:56:01.920" style="s2">and limitation</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:02.559" style="s2">are words that can&#39;t be defined without</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.920" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.559" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">or a synonym of them they&#39;re co-defining</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">concepts but they&#39;re also co-defining</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">realities</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">and so the idea the desire for just</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">more freedom is fundamentally a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">immaturity</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">as opposed to that every freedom has</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">limitations that come with it costs and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">investments that come with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">and i have to embrace them together and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m actually not choosing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.280" style="s2">more freedom in an absolute sense i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">choosing the freedoms that are more</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.280" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">monogamy is a very nice structure to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">able to give up</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">some things give up some freedoms</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">and feel good about it and not indulge</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">feeling resentful or lacking or bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.599" style="s2">as an as a choice not because i have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">because of something that i am choosing</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">because of a freedom i want so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">i want to be able to go to places of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">depth and commitment psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">sexually emotionally with her where i</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">have to create a safe enough container</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">for that for that to be possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.880" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a freedom there&#39;s a freedom that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">we can explore certain things in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">container that might not be possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">outside of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">and there are certain limitations i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">fully willing to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">for that um</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">in open relationship there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">hey that&#39;s common of</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.160" style="s2">rather than try to get all of your needs</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:37.119" style="s2">met from one person which makes you kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.160" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">of resent them</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.119" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">and manipulate them to be someone they</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">aren&#39;t you try to force your husband to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:44.160" style="s2">dance and he sucks at dancing but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.280" end="00:57:45.359" style="s2">good at other things but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.160" end="00:57:46.640" style="s2">disappointed in him because he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.359" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">that thing and you like it or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.640" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">how about just get different needs met</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">from different people and love each</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:51.599" style="s2">person for who they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">it sounds like a nice idea and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.599" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">some niceness to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">but there is in the monogamous dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">of course to some degree we just get</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.359" style="s2">different social needs met from</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">different people that we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">be having sex with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">called friends and community and family</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:12.079" style="s2">that you can have intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">relational experiences with but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.079" end="00:58:16.079" style="s2">also a place of being like hey</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">i want to grow with you where the things</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.079" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">that are really meaningful to you i want</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:19.839" style="s2">to grow into and develop to some</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:21.920" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">even if i wasn&#39;t interested in it on my</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.920" end="00:58:24.960" style="s2">own in that topic or that thing because</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in you and i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.960" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">in the connection we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:32.319" style="s2">and there&#39;s really um yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">something very beautiful about that</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.319" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">and around saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">where we could diversify our attention</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">into other relationships we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">deepening it</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:45.520" style="s2">and let&#39;s see how deep can we go into</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:46.559" style="s2">the depths of knowing each other and</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.520" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">knowing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.559" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">through the way we know each other so</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s these are all things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">monogamy can do very beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">and there&#39;s more and open relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">and each of these also have a shadow</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">there is coming to celibacy because of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:07.440" style="s2">just shame around sex and bodies</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">or because of just sucking</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.440" end="00:59:11.760" style="s2">interpersonally</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:15.839" style="s2">and not wanting to keep feeling rejected</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">um or you know other things like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.839" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">just being wounded in a relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">just retreating into the wound</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.720" style="s2">um there&#39;s pathological versions of</p>

<p begin="00:59:24.720" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">control and jealousy and insecurity and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">trying to get your security met through</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">with immaturities around more freedom</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">and of fear of commitment intimacy</p>

<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">i think some of the things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">learned in open relationship well</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">is different people bring out different</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">and the more intimate a relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:58.400" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t have to be sexual but</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">obviously that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.400" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">brings a whole depth of intimacy we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">we might find that there</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:08.079" style="s2">are like it&#39;s a common thing i hear</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">people in open relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.079" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">who are doing it thoughtfully say is</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:15.760" style="s2">wow i went places in my experience with</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">you that i&#39;ve never went with anyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.760" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">else but</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.240" end="01:00:21.839" style="s2">that&#39;s true for everyone there with</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s just the universe is a big</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.839" end="01:00:24.640" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">experience is a big place and that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.640" end="01:00:27.920" style="s2">different chemistries of those people</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">coming together make different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.920" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">like unlock</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">different things the way they trigger</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing the other thing is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">the ability to be very connected to</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">someone really not ambivalent about</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:49.280" style="s2">them and also not try to control them</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">is a very deep process it says i love</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.280" end="01:00:51.119" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:53.040" style="s2">i want to be connected i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">yourself that are good for you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">and even if some of that takes you away</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">from me i want that more than i want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">try to control something that is not</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">what you most want</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a very deep and profound and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:09.920" style="s2">beautiful process</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.839" end="01:01:12.000" style="s2">of moving more into something that i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.920" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">think deserves to be called love</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.000" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">than control and insecurity</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:23.359" style="s2">um also getting to</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">work past rivalry and getting to have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.359" end="01:01:26.799" style="s2">sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">okay i&#39;m doing this prayer about my</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.799" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">desire for the well-being of all mankind</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">holding all humanity as brothers but</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:34.160" style="s2">really if you [ __ ] with my woman i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:36.480" style="s2">gonna hit you in the face</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.160" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">i&#39;m just holding you as a rival and my</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.480" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">prayers don&#39;t really mean anything right</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:42.799" style="s2">so then there&#39;s a question of like what</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">does it mean to say i want for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.799" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">and i want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">embrace people&#39;s brothers and i want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">have non-rival risks dynamics like</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">way and like the the more</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">intimate the thing that&#39;s being shared</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:57.599" style="s2">the more</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">depth of intimacy in that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.280" end="01:02:05.039" style="s2">and the more overcoming rivalry and kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">of interactions have to occur</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.039" end="01:02:08.640" style="s2">so i think all of those structures can</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.640" end="01:02:15.799" style="s2">explored in a mature way</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">valuably i think they can all be</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:22.960" style="s2">shadow reasons in a kind of pre-trans</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">fallacy and that&#39;s what i see more often</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.960" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">than not</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.319" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">i think open relationship is harder just</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:30.880" style="s2">fundamentally harder than monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">because monogamy</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s i have to like pay attention to my</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">okay to go to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">uh 20 more minutes</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">uh sure yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">hannah you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">okay so originally i was going to ask</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:42.240" style="s2">um systemic trauma and your strategy</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.839" style="s2">surrounding that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.240" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">but what is more likely to me right now</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.839" end="01:05:51.440" style="s2">is you know there are some people</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:52.240" style="s2">like us at the stoa who are interested</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.440" end="01:05:54.319" style="s2">in developing</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.240" end="01:05:56.720" style="s2">sovereignty and there are some people</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.319" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">for whom that is not a concern</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.720" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">and we work with these people and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">friends with these people and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">relationships with these people</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">so what what are your strategies</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:11.359" style="s2">for continuing to develop sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">in relationship to and in connection to</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.359" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">this ecology of people who are not doing</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.839" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.240" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s a few ways to answer this</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">so one way is you think about</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.200" end="01:06:40.880" style="s2">when someone uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:42.400" style="s2">is transplanting a small tree they plant</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.880" end="01:06:45.200" style="s2">a tree in a place</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.400" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">they put tree stakes around it because</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.200" end="01:06:49.200" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t yet established its root base</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:52.480" style="s2">maybe they put a fence around it to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.200" end="01:06:55.200" style="s2">protect it from deer or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.480" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">once it establishes its root base you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">you know tie things to it and use it as</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:03.200" style="s2">a stabilizer</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">but to begin with it needs stabilized</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.200" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">in people&#39;s personal development it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:10.000" style="s2">that way for most people</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:12.480" style="s2">where there is a desire to be able to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.000" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">stable in a particular set of capacities</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.480" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">or virtues or values to be able to help</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">other people with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the honest</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:20.240" style="s2">developmental recognition when that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">not true yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.240" end="01:07:23.280" style="s2">and doing that will just pull the little</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.000" end="01:07:26.319" style="s2">tree over</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.280" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">and that the developmentally right thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.319" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">is to be around people further ahead</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">than you</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:34.480" style="s2">in that particular line of development</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.359" style="s2">until it becomes stabilized enough that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.480" end="01:07:38.640" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.359" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">not be thrown off going into places and</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.640" end="01:07:42.319" style="s2">that are further off and you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">actually help that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.319" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">something i think is an important</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">consideration so</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">the i&#39;ll say a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">this because i think it&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:54.960" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:54.960" style="s2">most people acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">so jewish saying proximity is destiny</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:04.000" style="s2">that who you are around is going to end</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:05.039" style="s2">up determining the course of your life</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.000" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">more than any other</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:09.599" style="s2">single thing is and it&#39;s true because as</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">social primates</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">we&#39;re influenced by what we take in on</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:15.200" style="s2">tv and by our own thinking and by our</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">disciplines but we&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.200" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">and and the physical environment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">in but we&#39;re more influenced by the</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">people we&#39;re around than pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:21.839" style="s2">anything else</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:26.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">so being cognizant of that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.319" end="01:08:30.400" style="s2">why there&#39;s aphorisms like</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">um keep the company of the wise and keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.400" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">the company of saints and whatever in</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:36.719" style="s2">every culture that has some wisdom to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">like that&#39;s an important thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.719" end="01:08:39.839" style="s2">and then of course who are all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">people seeking the company of the wise</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.839" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">who aren&#39;t there there&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">developmental recognition that people</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">get to a place where that can be more of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">an offering</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:48.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">so i would not try to help</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.359" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">people ground in something you are not</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.480" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">grounded in</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">the next thing is when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.120" end="01:09:09.279" style="s2">about your own desire to</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">increase sovereignty and then that other</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.279" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">people don&#39;t have that desire as much</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">maintaining your own sovereignty with</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.759" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">respect to the where they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">if you get if you get bent out of shape</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:24.159" style="s2">something else um that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.159" style="s2">the place for your practice not for</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.159" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">trying to change them</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.159" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">um your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">see them where they&#39;re at accept them</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">except you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">where you&#39;re at right and have some</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.799" end="01:09:40.319" style="s2">piece around that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:44.000" style="s2">going to be important and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.319" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">after those two i would say learning how</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.000" end="01:09:46.960" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:48.560" style="s2">more effective at influence is actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.960" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.560" end="01:09:52.319" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s paying attention to who</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:54.480" style="s2">you actually can influence</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.319" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.480" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">what effective influence strategies are</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.640" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">but the foundation of effective</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:05.040" style="s2">influence strategies with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">things like virtue development always</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.040" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">start with your own embodiment and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:17.840" style="s2">any follow-up hannah</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">no i&#39;m good thank you all right</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">um jason you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.800" end="01:10:34.400" style="s2">hey yeah um so can you hear me</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.360" end="01:10:36.239" style="s2">great um so most of the time when i hear</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.400" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">the term collective intelligence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.239" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:42.640" style="s2">the mouths of intellectuals who are a</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">tiny fraction of society so</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.640" end="01:10:46.800" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering how can we foster a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">collective intelligence that&#39;s inclusive</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">and integrates</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">other forms of wisdom beyond just</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">education or</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">kind of like whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.239" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">self initiated or institutional</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">is there are there other paths that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">can kind of bring us all</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:07.360" style="s2">up to speed without becoming an</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.840" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:15.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.679" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">there&#39;s several sub questions in there</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.679" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">that i hear</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">um one is does everyone have to develop</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">intellect for society to function well</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:31.280" style="s2">and refining that would be how much</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">development of intellect is necessary</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.280" end="01:11:36.560" style="s2">to engage as a citizen well</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:38.800" style="s2">and the other question is what types of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.560" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">human development other than intellect</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.800" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">meaningful and can contribute to</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:46.560" style="s2">collective capacity in some way</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:48.719" style="s2">and then how do we engage those</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.560" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.719" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">and maybe also a question around does</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">even have similar aptitude</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">for all of the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:06.159" style="s2">intelligence and how do we um</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">work with that and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.159" end="01:12:10.560" style="s2">like those are all very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.560" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.679" end="01:12:25.520" style="s2">the term collective intelligence is</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.280" end="01:12:27.360" style="s2">a term that is not exactly synonymous</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.520" end="01:12:28.800" style="s2">but close to synonymous with other terms</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">that other groups use to mean more</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.800" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">broad things like productive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">right there is some relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">those topics so</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:41.840" style="s2">for the most part traditional economists</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to talk about collective</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.840" end="01:12:45.120" style="s2">intelligence but they will talk about a</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:47.840" style="s2">society&#39;s productive capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.120" end="01:12:49.360" style="s2">and its productive base and they will</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.840" end="01:12:51.199" style="s2">recognize that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.360" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">invisible hand of the market is an</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.199" end="01:12:54.239" style="s2">emergent collective intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">contributed by</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.239" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">all of the supply and demand and</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:01.679" style="s2">innovation patterns across the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">interaction of all those people</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.679" end="01:13:04.800" style="s2">so collective intelligence theory would</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.800" end="01:13:08.239" style="s2">at the market as a collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:11.760" style="s2">intelligence mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.239" end="01:13:13.600" style="s2">and that what people want</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.760" end="01:13:15.360" style="s2">and the up regulation of who supplies</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.600" end="01:13:16.719" style="s2">that well and that driving innovation</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.360" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">and whatever that whole kind of market</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.719" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">theory you can look at that through the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">lens of collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">acknowledge that people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:25.360" style="s2">innovation their creativity their</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">desires all kinds of things are</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.360" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">part of that other than just their</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">intellect</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously study and collective</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.840" end="01:13:38.640" style="s2">intelligence of types of</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">group problem solving and coherence and</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.640" end="01:13:41.440" style="s2">choice making that are other than</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.440" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">like a tribe that gets together and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:49.280" style="s2">have a big decision to make</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:52.080" style="s2">so they all start by</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.280" end="01:13:53.120" style="s2">dancing in a drum circle around a fire</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.080" end="01:13:54.719" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t seem like an</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.120" end="01:13:56.000" style="s2">intellectual thing but what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.719" end="01:13:58.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.000" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">the drum circle itself is having the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.080" end="01:14:01.920" style="s2">people do their own thing on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.120" style="s2">drum but also find synchrony with each</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">other so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.120" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">balancing of individuation and harmony</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:11.440" style="s2">right of sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.679" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">communion and the people who are dancing</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.040" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">are all doing their own dance but all to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">the same base beat</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:24.239" style="s2">so similarly there is a embodied</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:26.239" style="s2">experience of being an individual in</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.239" end="01:14:28.080" style="s2">harmony with other individuals</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.239" end="01:14:29.520" style="s2">and that embodied experience where then</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.080" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing each other and seeing</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.520" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">their eyes and having that experience</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">then they sit</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.480" end="01:14:35.840" style="s2">and they have a felt sense of their own</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">individual place</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.840" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">and their connectivity with each other</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.520" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">that changes the state they&#39;re in when</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:43.280" style="s2">they go in to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like a social</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.280" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">technology that&#39;s a pretty awesome</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">social technology that evolution</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:49.600" style="s2">selected for for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:51.600" style="s2">that isn&#39;t what you would consider an</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.600" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">intellectual process</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.600" end="01:14:57.360" style="s2">but absolutely might increase the</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">quality of problem solving of that group</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.360" end="01:15:01.199" style="s2">might it might even make their</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">intellectual capacities more capable</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.199" end="01:15:04.159" style="s2">coming to bear</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:06.000" style="s2">we can look at other things that it</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.159" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">probably does like move people from a</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.000" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">more sympathetic to parasympathetic</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.679" end="01:15:11.120" style="s2">place which makes executive function</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:12.560" style="s2">more capable and limbic hijack less</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.120" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">possible and you know other things like</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.560" end="01:15:17.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">so the question of are there lots of</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:20.239" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:21.120" style="s2">types of knowing and intelligence that</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.239" end="01:15:24.080" style="s2">are possible and</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:25.679" style="s2">important and can we figure out ways of</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.080" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">engaging all of them and not over</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.679" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">norming on some of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:30.239" style="s2">is a super important question and well</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:31.840" style="s2">beyond the scope of me answering how we</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.239" end="01:15:34.239" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.840" end="01:15:34.239" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.520" end="01:15:41.360" style="s2">will everyone be equally intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.640" end="01:15:41.360" style="s2">of course not</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">just like will everyone be equally</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:50.080" style="s2">artistic or</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:50.480" style="s2">kind of course not is there a minimum</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.080" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.480" end="01:15:55.040" style="s2">of kindness and a minimum level of</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">rationality that is necessary for people</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.040" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">to be able to be part of</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:01.600" style="s2">effective social constructs yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:06.320" style="s2">and this is kind of the baseline of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.480" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">we would call a culture</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.320" end="01:16:10.239" style="s2">or uh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.040" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">if you think about the chakras</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.719" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">as a model for types of intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.040" end="01:16:26.719" style="s2">which is a good way to think about them</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:29.600" style="s2">that each one of them was like a</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">a center of capacity or intelligence or</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.600" end="01:16:32.840" style="s2">wisdom or awakening or something like</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:36.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.840" end="01:16:40.239" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.880" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">chakra corresponding to</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.239" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2">the solar plexus would traditionally be</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.640" end="01:16:46.719" style="s2">interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.520" end="01:16:50.400" style="s2">as being associated with will</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.719" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">that the kind of intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.400" end="01:16:54.800" style="s2">is related to what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:58.960" style="s2">earlier with like power literacy</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.800" end="01:17:00.640" style="s2">is there&#39;s a the generator question</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.960" end="01:17:02.800" style="s2">there is how do i relate</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.640" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">to this topic or this situation in a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.800" end="01:17:07.520" style="s2">that empowers me</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of intelligence right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.520" end="01:17:10.800" style="s2">a kind of intelligence to say what do i</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.040" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">focus on what meaning do i give it how</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.800" end="01:17:14.320" style="s2">do i relate with it that empowers me</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:16.719" style="s2">which is a different question than what</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">is objectively true and provable</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.719" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.480" end="01:17:24.560" style="s2">the chakra that we would associate with</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.280" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">the throat having to do with</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.560" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:30.480" style="s2">if i&#39;m communicating i&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:32.880" style="s2">talking at somebody</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.480" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to create communion with them</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.880" end="01:17:37.360" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to find</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">commonality um there&#39;s some purpose why</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.360" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking so i&#39;m wanting what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:45.120" style="s2">saying to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:48.480" style="s2">received and land right so i have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.120" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">actually put myself to</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.480" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">communicate effectively i have to put</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">myself in the other person&#39;s shoes and</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.640" style="s2">how would i communicate this thing to</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:17:58.400" style="s2">them where this would land</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.640" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">and wouldn&#39;t hit their triggers or be</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.400" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">rejected so</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:04.560" style="s2">how do i communicate effectively</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:06.960" style="s2">involves empathy for the other</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.560" end="01:18:08.480" style="s2">and self-reflection around what is true</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.960" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">for you and what your intent in</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.480" end="01:18:13.120" style="s2">communicating is</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">those types of intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.120" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">would be associated with that chakra</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.440" end="01:18:23.280" style="s2">and so the intellect</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.880" end="01:18:26.159" style="s2">which is the capacity to discern what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.280" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">same and what is different</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.159" end="01:18:30.480" style="s2">right what do what where is their</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">sameness or commonality between things</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.480" end="01:18:36.400" style="s2">where is their difference or distinction</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:38.640" style="s2">and then what is the kind of relatedness</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.400" end="01:18:39.600" style="s2">you can think of intellect which is</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.640" end="01:18:41.440" style="s2">distinct from</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.600" end="01:18:42.640" style="s2">what we might call mind mind might</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.440" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">involve</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.640" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">a lot of narratives running and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:47.679" style="s2">identity and software but intellect is</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:52.840" style="s2">just the pure compute function of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">capacity for discernment</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.840" end="01:18:58.480" style="s2">discerning</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.840" end="01:19:01.199" style="s2">truth from falseness sameness from</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.480" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">difference those types of things</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.199" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">and that was actually in in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:11.520" style="s2">yogic chakra system that was the very</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">highest of the chakras before union with</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.520" end="01:19:18.400" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:21.280" style="s2">um what i would say is that any of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.400" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">develop like the human developmental</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.280" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">philosophic traditions</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:28.320" style="s2">i interpret that the highest thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.920" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.320" end="01:19:33.199" style="s2">offering is how to develop all of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:36.960" style="s2">parts of self for everybody</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.199" end="01:19:40.239" style="s2">so we can say oh the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.960" end="01:19:41.280" style="s2">heart chakra the the path there is</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.239" end="01:19:45.120" style="s2">bhakti yoga</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.280" end="01:19:48.880" style="s2">about love and devotion or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.120" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">uh and maybe the intellect would be gyan</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.880" end="01:19:52.239" style="s2">yoga and there are different paths and i</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:55.360" style="s2">can pick one</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.239" end="01:19:56.960" style="s2">i think the more kind of well-rounded</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.360" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.960" end="01:20:02.000" style="s2">is for us to connect with</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">all the dimensions of our self and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.000" end="01:20:06.159" style="s2">develop all the dimensions of our self</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:08.000" style="s2">so that there gets to be a maximum</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.159" end="01:20:09.600" style="s2">wholeness of self</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.000" end="01:20:11.920" style="s2">in the fullest relationship of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.600" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">wholeness of reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.920" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">so if any for someone to say oh i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">intellectual i don&#39;t need to feel</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.440" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">their intellect is going to be limited</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.159" end="01:20:24.159" style="s2">by the depth of the experience of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:25.760" style="s2">those symbols mean related to the ground</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.159" end="01:20:29.440" style="s2">of experience</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.760" end="01:20:32.719" style="s2">right um so</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.440" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">i i want a culture where</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.719" end="01:20:39.040" style="s2">everyone values intellect and experience</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:41.120" style="s2">and artistry and awe and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.040" end="01:20:43.360" style="s2">things and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.120" end="01:20:45.040" style="s2">values developing all of those aspects</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.360" end="01:20:46.159" style="s2">in themselves in a way that is aligned</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.040" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">and unique to who they are</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.159" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">not that everyone will be developing</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">them identically or equally</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.280" end="01:20:58.239" style="s2">beautiful thank you</p>

<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:33.440" style="s2">things and want to take time</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:34.880" style="s2">to think and reflect and develop</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.440" end="01:21:36.480" style="s2">themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.880" end="01:21:38.800" style="s2">and create a community of shared</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.480" end="01:21:39.920" style="s2">development both for themselves and in</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.800" end="01:21:42.560" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.920" end="01:21:44.960" style="s2">society and civilization more broadly</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.560" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2">and the relationship between those of</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.960" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">how do i become a citizen of the future</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:50.080" style="s2">i want to see how do i develop myself so</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:51.600" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.080" end="01:21:53.199" style="s2">can actually apprehend that world and</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.600" end="01:21:55.840" style="s2">i&#39;m a part of it</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.199" end="01:21:57.600" style="s2">um and so that i&#39;m more capable of</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.840" end="01:21:59.120" style="s2">helping bring it about</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.600" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">um that kind of bi-directional</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.120" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">relationship super important</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.360" end="01:22:03.840" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.560" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">uh you know when you um</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.920" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">offered for me to come and do the four</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:14.480" style="s2">times in a row</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:17.760" style="s2">i happened to be in a in a very busy</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.480" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">time with trying to launch this project</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.760" end="01:22:21.120" style="s2">and so i was thinking okay maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:23.520" style="s2">do that in a couple years</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.120" end="01:22:24.239" style="s2">but um it doesn&#39;t actually take that</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.520" end="01:22:25.679" style="s2">much time</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.239" end="01:22:27.600" style="s2">since it&#39;s just questions and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.679" end="01:22:29.920" style="s2">hosting it doing all the work of it and</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.600" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.920" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">and what i think i think this community</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">is actually very well set to</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.440" end="01:22:45.440" style="s2">help the kind of movement process</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:47.040" style="s2">consilience project is working on asking</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.440" end="01:22:47.280" style="s2">these questions being in practice around</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.040" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.280" end="01:22:52.960" style="s2">and uh so yeah this is fun and</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:54.800" style="s2">i think the intent or the hope was that</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.960" end="01:22:55.520" style="s2">these four get to build on each other so</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.800" end="01:22:57.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.520" end="01:22:59.120" style="s2">need to ask the same questions again</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.520" end="01:23:01.679" style="s2">mostly we&#39;ll kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.120" end="01:23:03.440" style="s2">ask new ones and maybe get to reference</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.679" end="01:23:04.880" style="s2">earlier things we talked about so</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.440" end="01:23:07.360" style="s2">be interesting to see where we get by</p>
