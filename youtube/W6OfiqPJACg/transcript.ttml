<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:24.830" style="s2">kind of went mad in the end because he</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a Tantra community perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.830" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">would you agree with that no I would say</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">that Nietzsche is still living in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">Protestant Christian shadow what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">problem is you don&#39;t have a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">the borrowed absolute this is why return</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">to the borrowed absolute constantly</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">because if you&#39;re Eastern your</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">Zoroastrian Buddhist or Taoist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">obvious to this Tantra and their Sutra</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">and the division between Santa suit is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">essentially that if you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">knowledge all the way in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.329" style="s2">you educate a people for example that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">what Sutra does but if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.329" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">curious about the world and you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.219" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">to go out there in the wild and you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">pursue you know some kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">truth beyond what&#39;s actually required</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">for you to be a responsible citizen to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">begin what like so you want to be more</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">shamanic and that&#39;s definitely what</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">Tantra is and to me since I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">with at the moment we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">reintroduce this idea of the bar at</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">absolute in western thinking it would</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">solve a lot of problems for many Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:28.259" style="s2">thinkers even Heidegger I give you an</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">example of Heidegger struggling between</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">the two logos there&#39;s a Greek logos for</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">Heidegger and there&#39;s another Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">logo for Heidegger that he finds in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">Christianity and especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.829" style="s2">Gospel of John and he puts the Gospel of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">John against the logos of religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.829" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">obviously he doesn&#39;t think much of Plato</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:46.619" style="s2">need to do odd but the logos of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">Heraclitus and and the logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.619" end="00:01:52.259" style="s2">Gospel of John are to me much it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">easier to understand why we see this</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.259" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">attitude even logos historically if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.030" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">introduce the bard absolute as well so</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">let&#39;s slow down a bit here so the logos</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:04.490" style="s2">of Saint John is in the beginning there</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">was the word something like that yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.490" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">logos essentially is an idea of language</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">being able to capture reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:16.459" style="s2">we know now for example that mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">is the way we do that a lot easier so we</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.459" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">have a loud language to be more poetic</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">and more a place of art that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:24.890" style="s2">allylic philosophy ultimately fails</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.230" style="s2">because he turns in a language is some</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.890" end="00:02:29.239" style="s2">kind of logically coherent way the young</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.230" end="00:02:31.220" style="s2">Wittgenstein these guys try that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.239" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">failed why because mathematics does that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.220" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">you&#39;re perfectly already we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:37.010" style="s2">language do that language can then be</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">mythos so language can then be more</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.010" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">poetic and theatrical and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:43.129" style="s2">the way it works is that I know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.690" style="s2">Thomas and I&#39;d like you to see to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.129" end="00:02:47.390" style="s2">your input here but we talked a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.690" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">about the different brain house and when</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.390" end="00:02:51.230" style="s2">I look at logos pathos and missiles I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:53.060" style="s2">think the best way to describe is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.230" end="00:02:55.220" style="s2">nature&#39;s giving us one brain half which</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.060" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">is Lobos another brain half which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.220" end="00:03:00.079" style="s2">pathos with us that&#39;s why that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.090" style="s2">storytelling and narrative starts with</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.079" end="00:03:04.069" style="s2">mythos is always mythical because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.090" end="00:03:06.799" style="s2">storytelling itself is really the story</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.069" end="00:03:09.769" style="s2">how wine brain have called logos another</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.799" end="00:03:11.959" style="s2">brain have called pathos try to unify</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.769" end="00:03:14.840" style="s2">the worldview and that&#39;s what mythos</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.959" end="00:03:17.510" style="s2">originally does to ourselves oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.840" end="00:03:19.459" style="s2">great so the mythos unifies the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.510" end="00:03:21.769" style="s2">hemispheres that that&#39;s kind of yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.459" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">know Gilchrist working on the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.769" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">hemispheres everybody and to me when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">look at narrative you know I&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">here working every day on narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">narrative what is it well there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">much we can actually tell by just</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:34.099" style="s2">separating having three narratives to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.269" end="00:03:36.109" style="s2">start with a great we&#39;re looking at it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.099" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">not a narratives not a struggle to logos</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.109" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">and whistles especially since</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:41.870" style="s2">mathematics takes care and logos</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:44.090" style="s2">wonderfully no mythos is rather the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.870" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">story about mankind but what is then</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.090" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">besides logos what mythos is just the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.790" end="00:03:51.079" style="s2">narrative fundamentally about logos and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">pathos then we have a logical narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.079" end="00:03:56.329" style="s2">that science as mathematics and we also</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">have a path achill narrative that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.329" end="00:04:01.790" style="s2">know pornography and violence and sex</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:05.180" style="s2">and art when art is truly transformative</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.790" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">when we lose when we lose we lose sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.180" end="00:04:11.060" style="s2">of we lose control of the narrative when</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:13.160" style="s2">the narrative becomes sacred as Sharad</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.060" end="00:04:15.230" style="s2">would say rather than controlled in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.160" end="00:04:19.190" style="s2">adult manner when it becomes trantric</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.230" end="00:04:22.539" style="s2">that&#39;s when I vector back to stage is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.190" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">exactly done is back to the Sutra Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.539" end="00:04:30.599" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:34.199" style="s2">I guess I guess Sutra creates a bar so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.599" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">that which blocks the pathos from from</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.199" end="00:04:38.729" style="s2">entering whereas when you enter Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">you work with pathos as well you work</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.729" end="00:04:42.750" style="s2">with them perhaps all three or oh you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">you are actually even beyond the bard</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.750" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">episode when you are in Tantra that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">why Thomas is stressed before that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:51.629" style="s2">must understand it&#39;s dangerous you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:54.629" style="s2">Tantra you go well you need an early</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.629" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">dangerous you need Sutra Tantra is I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.629" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">would say is what you&#39;re probably move</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">into if you have any of these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.719" style="s2">shamanic cast characteristics about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:05.550" style="s2">yourself then then Tantra could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.719" end="00:05:07.229" style="s2">available to you but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.550" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">journey for everybody and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.229" end="00:05:12.180" style="s2">challenging journey definitely you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:14.219" style="s2">walking into like we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.180" end="00:05:16.409" style="s2">donation the donation is also split</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.219" end="00:05:17.610" style="s2">something Nietzsche misses out again</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.409" end="00:05:19.620" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t think the bard</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.610" end="00:05:21.539" style="s2">absolute if you do introduce the bard</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.620" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">absolutely needed donation you discover</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.539" end="00:05:27.569" style="s2">that the lower part of the bard absolute</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:29.279" style="s2">is the raw soy and lynch mob right</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.569" end="00:05:31.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what Christianity tries to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.279" end="00:05:33.029" style="s2">what making Christ&#39;s ultimate scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.500" end="00:05:34.650" style="s2">at least thinks it&#39;s very reassuring</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.029" end="00:05:36.330" style="s2">right but the other half of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.650" end="00:05:39.240" style="s2">dimension that meat you can&#39;t separate</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.330" end="00:05:42.120" style="s2">come upon us were coming if is the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">wisdom part of it mmm-hmm and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">when you introduce a tantric approach</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.449" end="00:05:49.650" style="s2">towards the donation Thomas can you keep</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">commenting on it on some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.650" end="00:05:58.560" style="s2">just to get you in this point there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:06:01.830" style="s2">much but I think that the I really love</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.560" end="00:06:03.599" style="s2">to to find tantric ideas and some</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.830" end="00:06:06.719" style="s2">transfer I&#39;d love to find these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.599" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">reflected in investment thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.719" end="00:06:10.919" style="s2">philosophers and I think that that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:12.930" style="s2">know you can of course read all of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.919" end="00:06:14.039" style="s2">Tibetan texts and Buddhist texts and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.930" end="00:06:16.169" style="s2">stuff like that but if you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.039" end="00:06:19.710" style="s2">an idea of what tantric attitude is</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.169" end="00:06:21.990" style="s2">about you can find that in nature and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.710" end="00:06:22.440" style="s2">one of the core ideas of niches is amor</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.990" end="00:06:25.289" style="s2">fati</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.440" end="00:06:27.509" style="s2">that&#39;s the love what is and accept what</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.289" end="00:06:30.029" style="s2">is and and rather than trying to run</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.509" end="00:06:32.729" style="s2">away from it you you you basically use</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.029" end="00:06:34.710" style="s2">it in an effective manner and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.729" end="00:06:36.830" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially the core of Tantra so</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">you you know reject anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.830" end="00:06:41.690" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely inclusive and the citric</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:45.020" style="s2">attitude which which you should also</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.690" end="00:06:47.110" style="s2">adopt that is that is a if that always</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.020" end="00:06:50.420" style="s2">includes renunciation so you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.110" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">to reject some some attitudes or some</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.420" end="00:06:53.420" style="s2">some some ways of being that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:56.570" style="s2">inherently dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.420" end="00:06:58.670" style="s2">like for example anger is a classic</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:00.710" style="s2">example right I mean you really need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.670" end="00:07:02.540" style="s2">put limits to that but you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.710" end="00:07:03.980" style="s2">completely give it up at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.540" end="00:07:05.720" style="s2">have to come to terms with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.980" end="00:07:07.670" style="s2">anger will be a part of your life and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.720" end="00:07:10.070" style="s2">you better learn how to deal with it in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.670" end="00:07:12.500" style="s2">an in an effective way and turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.070" end="00:07:15.140" style="s2">art or turn it into a sacred ornament</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.500" end="00:07:17.480" style="s2">that would be a typical way of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.140" end="00:07:19.880" style="s2">there&#39;s anger types and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.480" end="00:07:21.770" style="s2">like in the in the Buddhist iconography</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.880" end="00:07:24.050" style="s2">there&#39;s anger types and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.770" end="00:07:26.150" style="s2">type passionate types and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.050" end="00:07:28.370" style="s2">like people who are a bit more space</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.150" end="00:07:30.920" style="s2">either like or or and then there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.370" end="00:07:32.840" style="s2">know you know their different types of</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.920" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">personalities and we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.840" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">stuck in these types right in these</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.080" style="s2">archetypes so you can&#39;t you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.210" style="s2">can&#39;t destroy them you can&#39;t get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.080" end="00:07:42.710" style="s2">them you can&#39;t you know erase them</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:45.830" style="s2">through through doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.710" end="00:07:47.540" style="s2">meditation particularly and then touch</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.830" end="00:07:50.600" style="s2">where you kind of embrace them on some</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.540" end="00:07:52.250" style="s2">level so how can I ask you guys then how</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.600" end="00:07:53.660" style="s2">does this relate to what religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.250" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">essentially is according to Renee</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.660" end="00:07:57.170" style="s2">Sherrod res strongly agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:07:59.300" style="s2">religion fundamentally consists of</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.170" end="00:08:01.610" style="s2">prohibition which is domestication and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.300" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">controlled and civilizing ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.610" end="00:08:05.420" style="s2">the other one is ritual and richer than</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.090" style="s2">often is the opposite ritual is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.420" end="00:08:12.260" style="s2">you let it all out so you do you you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.090" end="00:08:14.450" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t you ride the nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.260" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">inside of you you don&#39;t try to contain</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.450" end="00:08:17.270" style="s2">it and control it to eliminate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually when it goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.270" end="00:08:21.830" style="s2">terribly wrong right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:23.600" style="s2">so how does this relate to the tantra</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.830" end="00:08:26.990" style="s2">versus sutra divide when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.600" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">prohibition and ritual i think that so i</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.990" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">think your art is very suit rick because</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:35.720" style="s2">he never really talks about about a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">constructive way of using the of using</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.720" end="00:08:39.740" style="s2">the dionyza it&#39;s just like no this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:41.660" style="s2">very dangerous this is basically it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.740" end="00:08:43.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the victim edge mechanism right</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.660" end="00:08:46.070" style="s2">that the mob goes crazy</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.220" end="00:08:47.630" style="s2">picks a scapegoat and kills it which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.070" end="00:08:49.370" style="s2">obviously something that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.630" end="00:08:50.300" style="s2">but the possibility of actually using</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.370" end="00:08:51.890" style="s2">that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.300" end="00:08:53.990" style="s2">more constructive way Jared doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.890" end="00:08:55.399" style="s2">really talk about that a lot and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.990" end="00:08:56.660" style="s2">where Nietzsche comes in so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.399" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">should really reach it right with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.660" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">Nietzsche right so Jerrod gives a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:03.560" style="s2">very good account of us of Sutra and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:05.690" style="s2">white Sutra is necessary and then each</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.560" end="00:09:07.880" style="s2">it kind of points out well that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.690" end="00:09:09.709" style="s2">true but still you can bring in this die</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.880" end="00:09:11.180" style="s2">and ice and energy in a certain way if</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.709" end="00:09:13.220" style="s2">you are careful well Nietzsche wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.180" end="00:09:14.660" style="s2">too careful about that actually but if</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.220" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">you if you read the two next to each</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.660" end="00:09:18.950" style="s2">other I think you can make a very good</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">integration yeah and also there&#39;s anger</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.950" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">for act like bar Badger pride for</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">example having a lot of pride or</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:27.320" style="s2">something like this is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:31.130" style="s2">very you know religion tries to temper</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.320" end="00:09:33.320" style="s2">that when you get into Tantra you kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.130" end="00:09:35.060" style="s2">of wear your pride you kind of embrace</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.320" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">your pride you don&#39;t try to destroy your</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.060" end="00:09:39.829" style="s2">ego you kind of it becomes transparent</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:41.390" style="s2">but you use it as a power in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.829" end="00:09:44.209" style="s2">of way so it&#39;s not and it also it</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.390" end="00:09:46.100" style="s2">becomes humorous exactly exactly you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.209" end="00:09:48.709" style="s2">know I think I think you really haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.100" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">you develop a sense of humor humor when</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.709" end="00:09:56.170" style="s2">you when you get to Tantra Bharat troupe</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">was very much emphasizing this you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.170" end="00:10:02.329" style="s2">it&#39;s about developing a sense of humor a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">basic sense of humor he called it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.329" end="00:10:07.670" style="s2">humor certainly belongs to pathos so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:10.070" style="s2">this would we would probably and again</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.670" end="00:10:12.170" style="s2">with the brain halves the hemispheres we</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.070" end="00:10:14.390" style="s2">describe that as again Dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.170" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">Apollonian that would be more like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.390" end="00:10:19.579" style="s2">Dionysian within pathos or Pathak</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:21.290" style="s2">narrative that Bologna would be logos</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.579" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">logic narrative and then mythos</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.290" end="00:10:26.089" style="s2">fundamental ease the truck they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:28.040" style="s2">bridge these two so that makes us and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.089" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">this again you could work with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.040" end="00:10:33.500" style="s2">powered absolute so you would have</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:34.610" style="s2">prohibition you would have ritual and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.500" end="00:10:36.410" style="s2">say you would have that within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.610" end="00:10:39.320" style="s2">community that would be the everyday</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.410" end="00:10:40.940" style="s2">practice of religion so you would for</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.320" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">example have certain dates of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.940" end="00:10:44.120" style="s2">calendar where you have rituals like</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:46.040" style="s2">carnivals and things would you let</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.120" end="00:10:47.630" style="s2">certain energies out that would make</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.040" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">sense to the vast majority people that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.630" end="00:10:51.199" style="s2">in between that they&#39;re gonna go through</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">long long periods of probation and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.199" end="00:10:54.860" style="s2">domestication I&#39;ll give you an example</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:56.540" style="s2">you know Trump up when he was being</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.860" end="00:10:58.279" style="s2">trained he was being trained in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.540" end="00:11:00.890" style="s2">monastery with very very strict rules</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.279" end="00:11:02.150" style="s2">like ridiculously uptight strict rules</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.890" end="00:11:06.110" style="s2">like you can&#39;t even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.150" end="00:11:08.870" style="s2">and then he was being the time came for</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.110" end="00:11:10.940" style="s2">him to get the tantric practice and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.870" end="00:11:13.880" style="s2">his teacher came out with some naked</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.940" end="00:11:15.290" style="s2">women and some alcohol and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.880" end="00:11:17.510" style="s2">almost had a heart attack because</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.290" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">because there was such a strong kaboo</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.510" end="00:11:22.100" style="s2">against those things in his monastic</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:26.150" style="s2">community you know that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.100" end="00:11:28.730" style="s2">thing that that the the Tantra does it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.150" end="00:11:31.400" style="s2">you you have extreme risk restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.730" end="00:11:33.890" style="s2">and extreme renunciation each sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.400" end="00:11:35.720" style="s2">it goes to extremes I think and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.890" end="00:11:40.220" style="s2">know and then and then suddenly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.720" end="00:11:42.530" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re launched into something</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.220" end="00:11:46.520" style="s2">that&#39;s much more you know energetically</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.530" end="00:11:48.470" style="s2">challenging and you know this is going</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.520" end="00:11:50.030" style="s2">to be very very important as we go</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.470" end="00:11:53.240" style="s2">forward say the next 20 to 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.030" end="00:11:54.920" style="s2">because I realize this enormous interest</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.240" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">in a statuses from now I&#39;m on young guys</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.920" end="00:11:58.700" style="s2">that I like to do martial arts to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:00.530" style="s2">meditation they discover they get a kick</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.700" end="00:12:02.030" style="s2">out of the fact they can control</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.530" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">themselves and control their mind</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.149" end="00:14:37.410" style="s2">because when you&#39;re gonna run a state</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:38.640" style="s2">bureaucracy the best way to do it just</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:41.790" style="s2">to have people that are incredibly</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.480" style="s2">but you had to de match the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.140" end="00:15:23.640" style="s2">bureaucracies with a world of art and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.480" end="00:15:25.110" style="s2">religion and that&#39;s where you allowed</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.730" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">you credit these separate monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.350" end="00:15:34.889" style="s2">where either monks would sit and go</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2">completely inwards or artists would just</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.310" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">on this dream of the perfect world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.470" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">and the only way we can deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:15:59.070" style="s2">eventually like Nietzsche says is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:02.250" style="s2">throw the Dionysian into this ultra</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.070" end="00:16:05.010" style="s2">Apollonian world that a Confucian state</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.250" end="00:16:08.790" style="s2">bureaucracy is it would make sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.010" end="00:16:10.589" style="s2">because China obviously today suffers</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.790" end="00:16:12.449" style="s2">from the same problem the West does and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.589" end="00:16:15.089" style="s2">it&#39;s the mythology of the separation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.449" end="00:16:16.949" style="s2">church and state when reality touch the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.089" end="00:16:21.449" style="s2">state of different roms within a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.949" end="00:16:25.170" style="s2">religion would you go back to the unity</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.449" end="00:16:27.630" style="s2">of church and state yeah but no I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:29.100" style="s2">I do so rest in at least to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.630" end="00:16:31.170" style="s2">think Buddhist would agree to that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.100" end="00:16:33.180" style="s2">only honest thing but you would say you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.170" end="00:16:35.220" style="s2">can have several DISA there is no</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.180" end="00:16:37.620" style="s2">separation between you know church and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.220" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">state there&#39;s only one world okay we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.620" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">cannot have a dualist worldview so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:43.139" style="s2">there&#39;s only one world in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:46.620" style="s2">there&#39;s only one society there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.139" end="00:16:48.569" style="s2">one humanity but so to start with</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.620" end="00:16:50.519" style="s2">acknowledge that and that&#39;s why I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.569" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">this elastance you need two different</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.519" end="00:16:55.410" style="s2">religions you need one religion that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.010" end="00:16:56.940" style="s2">unifies society but then within that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.410" end="00:16:58.380" style="s2">religion you can have three at least you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.940" end="00:16:59.940" style="s2">can I want for the priest you can or</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.380" end="00:17:01.769" style="s2">another religion for the military you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.940" end="00:17:03.720" style="s2">can have a third religion for regular</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.769" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">folks which we call polytheism where I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.720" end="00:17:06.929" style="s2">call it I chronology and actually the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:08.069" style="s2">fact that you have different religions</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.929" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">you have a tolerance between leads</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.069" end="00:17:10.350" style="s2">actually because that just reflects</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:12.660" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.350" end="00:17:15.689" style="s2">just like contra and Sutra fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.660" end="00:17:18.030" style="s2">are two different levels within the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.689" end="00:17:19.799" style="s2">religion no tantric teacher would say</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.030" end="00:17:21.689" style="s2">the Tantra is separate from Sutra as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.799" end="00:17:23.250" style="s2">separate religion but if you use</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.689" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">religions in plural is here it would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.250" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">like there&#39;s an overall religion within</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">which they both belong that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:33.350" style="s2">that&#39;s human relationships to reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.080" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">the wife yes I guess this is a so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.210" end="00:17:41.980" style="s2">using the world religion in in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:44.980" style="s2">that most people wouldn&#39;t recognize I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.980" end="00:17:46.539" style="s2">would I would say no but if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.980" end="00:17:47.830" style="s2">people what does religion mean it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.539" end="00:17:49.480" style="s2">like to ask them what does God mean they</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.830" end="00:17:51.370" style="s2">have no idea they just think somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.480" end="00:17:51.730" style="s2">else that they mimic he knows what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.370" end="00:17:56.049" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.730" end="00:17:57.789" style="s2">I say religion is the the process</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.049" end="00:17:59.679" style="s2">through which we try to contain</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.679" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">strangers in an instant so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:06.760" style="s2">about fostering I think it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.870" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">obviously fast your kids to one day</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.760" end="00:18:10.690" style="s2">become adults and then it&#39;s the job of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:12.730" style="s2">the priesthood to foster the dolts to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.690" end="00:18:14.649" style="s2">become civilized and what the priest</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.730" end="00:18:16.779" style="s2">then tried to do is that if you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.649" end="00:18:18.639" style="s2">stretch your imagination beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.779" end="00:18:20.230" style="s2">loyalty of the hundred and fifty seven</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.639" end="00:18:21.880" style="s2">of the dumbo number that you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.230" end="00:18:23.649" style="s2">with maybe you can set you to at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.880" end="00:18:25.659" style="s2">1,500 people you could have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.649" end="00:18:27.399" style="s2">loyalty with if you can then take it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.659" end="00:18:30.519" style="s2">beyond that then we have ideas called</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.399" end="00:18:32.710" style="s2">nations and empires and the larger unit</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.519" end="00:18:35.710" style="s2">you can express some kind of solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.710" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">with the better of y&#39;all are mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.710" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">okay this is why I sort of think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:41.500" style="s2">illusion that people can I sort of think</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:42.519" style="s2">it&#39;s an illusion that people can live</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.500" end="00:18:44.139" style="s2">without religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.519" end="00:18:45.610" style="s2">you know even when they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.139" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">religion they create all these pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.610" end="00:18:52.059" style="s2">religions just to oh yes yes the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:53.649" style="s2">replace the void they feel because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.059" end="00:18:58.179" style="s2">don&#39;t have real communitas they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.649" end="00:19:00.010" style="s2">have a real you know culture I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.179" end="00:19:01.779" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think even if it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.010" end="00:19:03.250" style="s2">Nazi and I don&#39;t care but we can&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.779" end="00:19:05.080" style="s2">round called Schmidt&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.250" end="00:19:06.639" style="s2">theology because you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.080" end="00:19:08.649" style="s2">even start a political science these</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.639" end="00:19:10.419" style="s2">days without having to go to college MIT</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.649" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">first regardless of whether you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.419" end="00:19:14.470" style="s2">go to the left of the right even the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.860" end="00:19:16.779" style="s2">smart left reads column it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.470" end="00:19:20.019" style="s2">political theology just says it all</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.779" end="00:19:22.210" style="s2">everything is theology theologies deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.019" end="00:19:25.240" style="s2">than philosophy everything is religion</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.210" end="00:19:27.700" style="s2">so the question is is liberalism a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.240" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">religion certainly conservatives and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.700" end="00:19:31.990" style="s2">religion certainly socialism religion</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">absolutely these are different ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.990" end="00:19:35.169" style="s2">the relation between human beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:37.059" style="s2">organized through the state well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.169" end="00:19:39.399" style="s2">a religious institution that&#39;s religion</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.059" end="00:19:42.429" style="s2">at least as much as the church ever was</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.399" end="00:19:44.289" style="s2">I would say that Tantra is actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.429" end="00:19:46.029" style="s2">actually a metal religion it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.289" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">something that looks at the prohibitions</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.029" end="00:19:48.320" style="s2">of religion and and does something</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:50.270" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.320" end="00:19:51.410" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of like that because if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.270" end="00:19:54.050" style="s2">if you have a system where the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.410" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">prohibitions are completely absolute so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.050" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">then you have something that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">suffocating something that as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.500" style="s2">pointed out so you get something</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:02.690" style="s2">something like like a suffocating</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.500" end="00:20:05.060" style="s2">bureaucracy so you need some kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:06.140" style="s2">need some kind of space where kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.060" end="00:20:08.150" style="s2">like you know as you call them you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.140" end="00:20:10.610" style="s2">that the shamanic types have their do</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.150" end="00:20:12.770" style="s2">their experiments on you want that space</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.610" end="00:20:14.660" style="s2">to be structured you want that sound</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.770" end="00:20:16.940" style="s2">that you don&#39;t want you want complete</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.660" end="00:20:18.560" style="s2">hedonism or or just chaos you actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.940" end="00:20:20.360" style="s2">want want something want a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.560" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">structure in there and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.360" end="00:20:24.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what Tantra tries to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:27.470" style="s2">right or Sutra brings in prohibitions</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.350" end="00:20:29.510" style="s2">like the big classic aim of religion we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.470" end="00:20:31.430" style="s2">bring in prohibition so that we that if</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.510" end="00:20:33.890" style="s2">we have violence that it&#39;s an organized</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.430" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">ones that we don&#39;t have total war war of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.890" end="00:20:37.880" style="s2">all against all which humans are very</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:39.650" style="s2">fond of and they always go there and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.880" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">unless unless religion stops them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.650" end="00:20:44.750" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s kind of the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:49.310" style="s2">kind of the checks and balances right</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.750" end="00:20:51.260" style="s2">yes your posting here in Sutra</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.310" end="00:20:53.180" style="s2">prohibition dominates and the occasional</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.260" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">ritual breaks up the probation otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.180" end="00:20:57.110" style="s2">people explode well when you go over to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:00.830" style="s2">Tantra the ritual dominates and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.110" end="00:21:02.150" style="s2">prohibition is hardly there at least you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.830" end="00:21:03.380" style="s2">should have been so tricked to begin</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.150" end="00:21:04.850" style="s2">with so you have your prohibitions</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.380" end="00:21:07.160" style="s2">already so you basically get out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.850" end="00:21:08.930" style="s2">those so the shift is towards ritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.160" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">dominates and prohibition becomes minor</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.930" end="00:21:17.420" style="s2">when you&#39;re going to the tundra</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">would that make sense yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.420" end="00:21:23.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s Roger can be actually it can</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:26.540" style="s2">be very baroque in its and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.170" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">behaviors and rules and and you know all</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.540" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">the things you would do but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">say I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re in service of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:35.270" style="s2">some kind of moralism I would say that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:36.890" style="s2">would say that it&#39;s kind of the commute</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.270" end="00:21:39.380" style="s2">the whole community becomes an art form</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.890" end="00:21:41.240" style="s2">of some kind yeah but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.380" end="00:21:43.930" style="s2">rules yeah it&#39;s not like breaking all</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.240" end="00:21:48.110" style="s2">the rules and you know in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.930" end="00:21:50.570" style="s2">Excel it&#39;s yeah so it&#39;s still in tension</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.110" end="00:21:53.750" style="s2">ceremony integration they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.570" end="00:21:55.340" style="s2">shamanic practices intention ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.750" end="00:21:57.140" style="s2">integration where you learn gradually</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.340" end="00:21:58.610" style="s2">you&#39;re attracted to the ceremony before</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.140" end="00:22:00.590" style="s2">you get in there and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.610" end="00:22:01.370" style="s2">discovered the sermon is only there to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.590" end="00:22:03.020" style="s2">break up</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.370" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">between the intention and integration</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.020" end="00:22:09.920" style="s2">because event that transforms you during</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:11.540" style="s2">the ritual is that the intention was who</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.920" end="00:22:13.490" style="s2">you were to yourself before you went</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.540" end="00:22:15.559" style="s2">into the ritual the integration is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.490" end="00:22:17.870" style="s2">new person you become afterwards mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.559" end="00:22:19.250" style="s2">so ceremony is only that state where</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.870" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">that happens that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.250" end="00:22:22.850" style="s2">during the ceremony that the crazy</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:24.170" style="s2">wisdom teacher throws in the horse and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.850" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">the booze and the drugs and everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.170" end="00:22:28.220" style="s2">if that&#39;s what you need because you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:30.020" style="s2">becoming this totally self-obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.220" end="00:22:31.460" style="s2">narcissistic Platonist and he just</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.020" end="00:22:34.610" style="s2">wanted to break you out of that spell</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.460" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">right so so yeah well you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.610" end="00:22:41.380" style="s2">broken out of your your mechanical you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:44.840" style="s2">know your your your stupid you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.380" end="00:22:46.340" style="s2">mechanical way of thinking so so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.840" end="00:22:47.929" style="s2">could be through drugs or it could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.340" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">through sobriety and it&#39;s yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.929" end="00:22:51.620" style="s2">it could be through it a lot of sex or</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:53.450" style="s2">it could be through and not having sex</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.620" end="00:22:55.190" style="s2">you know it could be it could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.450" end="00:22:57.500" style="s2">anything in fact there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.190" end="00:23:00.530" style="s2">sort of there&#39;s no sort of limit to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.500" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">skillful means of Tantra because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.530" end="00:23:07.309" style="s2">always a very individual relationship</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:09.170" style="s2">type of thing yeah oh yeah you know you</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:42.350" style="s2">Tantra and so trip beforehand but he</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.060" end="00:26:45.050" style="s2">wasn&#39;t well-versed in it I mean he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.350" end="00:26:48.650" style="s2">not to me I&#39;m not sure I get that split</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.050" end="00:26:50.630" style="s2">in the Dionysian idea because the split</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.650" end="00:26:53.030" style="s2">in the donation that&#39;s lacking in each</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.500" end="00:27:01.310" style="s2">donation because there&#39;s a bard</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.970" end="00:27:03.800" style="s2">absolutely the donation and there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.389" end="00:29:27.740" style="s2">conversation we talked about our</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.029" end="00:29:29.210" style="s2">Buddhism as origins and matched each</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.740" end="00:29:31.370" style="s2">other and you have a Buddhist background</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.210" end="00:29:34.070" style="s2">both of you certainly Dongshan Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.370" end="00:29:36.289" style="s2">but can you explain the different</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.070" end="00:29:38.389" style="s2">variations here with a small wheels and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.289" end="00:29:40.639" style="s2">the big wheel and all of that but where</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.389" end="00:29:44.360" style="s2">does Buddhism sort of so-to-speak go</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.639" end="00:29:45.649" style="s2">tantric and where does it go phallic can</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.360" end="00:29:46.760" style="s2">you explain that to me because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.429" end="00:29:53.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an aspect of Tantra right</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.330" end="00:31:39.380" style="s2">i think it&#39;s very much a balance between</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.830" end="00:31:41.420" style="s2">the the masculine in the feminine but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.380" end="00:31:43.520" style="s2">but the but the women can be you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.420" end="00:31:46.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a fierce aspect of femininity as</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.470" end="00:31:55.010" style="s2">kinds of female archetypes I think in</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.330" end="00:31:57.290" style="s2">Tantra which is one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.010" end="00:32:00.020" style="s2">love it and the male archetypes you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.290" end="00:32:03.170" style="s2">which can be very you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.020" end="00:32:08.990" style="s2">wrathful and fierce or you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.170" end="00:32:11.000" style="s2">or or or else just aesthetic and and you</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.000" end="00:32:17.540" style="s2">kinds of so I think it it it brings in</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:19.820" style="s2">personality or all the personalities all</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.540" end="00:32:21.740" style="s2">the different that&#39;s it there&#39;s a Maha</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.820" end="00:32:23.510" style="s2">yoga part right so that that deals a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.740" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">with you know the data yoga which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.510" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">essentially working with identities and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:31.790" style="s2">emerging in a certain way in the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">yeah yeah well the my yoga is yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.790" end="00:32:36.020" style="s2">deity yoga so you yeah you you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.890" end="00:32:37.400" style="s2">develop you do these elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.020" end="00:32:39.410" style="s2">visualizations where you become the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.400" end="00:32:40.910" style="s2">deity or something and then and then and</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.410" end="00:32:45.620" style="s2">then later on these the salt dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:49.940" style="s2">right so it&#39;s where I kind of sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.620" end="00:32:52.610" style="s2">it is uh so there&#39;s this there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.940" end="00:32:54.410" style="s2">are arguing actually genuine Buddhist um</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.610" end="00:32:57.080" style="s2">tries and isn&#39;t really given to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.410" end="00:32:59.780" style="s2">Westerners anymore right not after the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.080" end="00:33:02.210" style="s2">mister choking the greatness I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.780" end="00:33:03.880" style="s2">many ways the the mister chögyam trungpa</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.210" end="00:33:05.980" style="s2">made so and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.880" end="00:33:07.990" style="s2">so you you have to make the transition</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.980" end="00:33:09.789" style="s2">from sitting on a pillow and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.990" end="00:33:13.330" style="s2">know doing these visualizations and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.789" end="00:33:15.370" style="s2">know I&#39;m an angry deity and I have 20</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.330" end="00:33:18.220" style="s2">arms or whatever and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.370" end="00:33:22.870" style="s2">acting in the world right and that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.220" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">that is kind of where it very very Tori</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.870" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">can go wrong right that you cannot see</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:31.660" style="s2">these practices as goals in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:33.700" style="s2">rather than as as ways to point to ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.660" end="00:33:35.559" style="s2">of being in the world yeah well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.700" end="00:33:37.659" style="s2">a lot of the strong warnings at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.559" end="00:33:40.200" style="s2">beginning you know that it can go very</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.659" end="00:33:42.940" style="s2">wrong and that it&#39;s very dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.200" end="00:33:45.340" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with energy right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.940" end="00:33:49.390" style="s2">you&#39;re you know there&#39;s a yoga out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.340" end="00:33:51.429" style="s2">bottles yeah yeah yes I mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.390" end="00:33:52.929" style="s2">it so the higher the higher Tantra is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.429" end="00:33:55.000" style="s2">like you have Maha yoga which is about</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.929" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">essentially about identities it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.000" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">like playing around with it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">like relaxing your fixed sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:04.480" style="s2">and there you have actually already have</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:06.640" style="s2">a process idea right so do you start</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.480" end="00:34:09.129" style="s2">seeing yourself as kind of a fluid range</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.640" end="00:34:10.659" style="s2">of identities and then you do this Maha</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.129" end="00:34:11.859" style="s2">yoga and then then you have the UH new</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.659" end="00:34:14.859" style="s2">yoga with deals with all these subtle</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.859" end="00:34:17.879" style="s2">body practices right and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.859" end="00:34:21.129" style="s2">the - the - big - big branches of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.879" end="00:34:24.250" style="s2">tantric practices as far as I as I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.129" end="00:34:26.710" style="s2">yeah well you move into subtler several</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.250" end="00:34:29.530" style="s2">kind of kind of practices but but also</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.710" end="00:34:35.619" style="s2">you know the the basic practices can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.530" end="00:34:37.389" style="s2">very you know raw or physical or so so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.619" end="00:34:39.030" style="s2">know yoga can you tell me more about</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.389" end="00:34:42.369" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.030" end="00:34:44.290" style="s2">um I&#39;m not I&#39;m not good at this the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.369" end="00:34:48.040" style="s2">whole theory oh maybe I think Thomas is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.290" end="00:34:50.290" style="s2">better at that than me so you have Maha</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.040" end="00:34:52.990" style="s2">yoga which is which is I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.290" end="00:34:55.179" style="s2">kind of like very simplified right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.990" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">sure that this would totally disagree</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.179" end="00:34:58.630" style="s2">with me but so this is one way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">looking at it so a lot of practices deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.630" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">with identity so you visualize yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:03.369" style="s2">for example as a deity of the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:05.170" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.369" end="00:35:06.700" style="s2">so this is a very interesting experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.170" end="00:35:08.920" style="s2">right especially of you if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.700" end="00:35:10.630" style="s2">deep meditation practice these are this</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.920" end="00:35:12.310" style="s2">can be very transformative practices</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.630" end="00:35:14.680" style="s2">that so that&#39;s one aspect so you deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.310" end="00:35:17.230" style="s2">with identity so you start kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.680" end="00:35:17.640" style="s2">letting go of this fixed identity that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.230" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.640" end="00:35:21.630" style="s2">as a man as a woman as a father as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:24.510" style="s2">disorder and I think that many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.630" end="00:35:26.940" style="s2">would benefit from a practice yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.510" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">absolutely yeah so that&#39;s the Maha yoga</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.940" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">aspect and then you have the all new</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:31.859" style="s2">Yoga aspect that&#39;s a bit more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:33.990" style="s2">to explain and it often sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.859" end="00:35:35.819" style="s2">like new agey but but it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.990" end="00:35:38.130" style="s2">important practice and that&#39;s these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.819" end="00:35:41.519" style="s2">all these subtle energy practices where</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.170" end="00:46:12.740" style="s2">okay you could call that crazy wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:48:37.310" end="00:48:41.900" style="s2">this idea that Christ died for our sins</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:45.770" style="s2">right this is fairly recent</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.900" end="00:48:47.720" style="s2">this is Tove Jansson st. Anselm so this</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.770" end="00:48:49.310" style="s2">is ridiculous in my a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.720" end="00:48:51.440" style="s2">ridiculous story you know people</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.310" end="00:48:54.200" style="s2">misbehave so God sent his son to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.440" end="00:48:55.580" style="s2">earth so that he could be killed to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.200" end="00:48:57.410" style="s2">for the sins of the people</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.580" end="00:49:01.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the sacrificial version of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.410" end="00:49:03.710" style="s2">Christianity and and this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.550" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">this went wrong in the twelfth century</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.710" end="00:49:07.810" style="s2">and that&#39;s basically that might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.050" end="00:49:11.300" style="s2">coincidence was right before the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.810" end="00:49:12.500" style="s2">Crusades right so that was st. Anselm so</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.300" end="00:49:14.180" style="s2">and then there was another</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.500" end="00:49:16.520" style="s2">interpretation that a reaction is</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.180" end="00:49:21.170" style="s2">slightly better one and I was a there</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.520" end="00:49:22.820" style="s2">was a date anyway don&#39;t remember his</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.170" end="00:49:24.320" style="s2">name but another if not a very famous</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.820" end="00:49:26.270" style="s2">theologian he came up with and another</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.320" end="00:49:28.640" style="s2">interpretation there was no that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.270" end="00:49:31.700" style="s2">wrong right didn&#39;t that first thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.640" end="00:49:33.260" style="s2">a moral example right now so and these</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.700" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">are two of the interpretations that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.260" end="00:49:37.070" style="s2">know very well that space or ability so</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:37.850" style="s2">these are the two interpretation that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.070" end="00:49:39.980" style="s2">know well right</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.850" end="00:49:41.780" style="s2">eh Christ died for our sins or Christ is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.980" end="00:49:43.370" style="s2">immoral example this was not the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.780" end="00:49:49.550" style="s2">interpretation of the first thousand</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.370" end="00:49:52.370" style="s2">years no I agree of Christ revealed</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.550" end="00:49:54.530" style="s2">something it revealed the devil it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.370" end="00:49:57.380" style="s2">what it did it reveal a very very simple</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.530" end="00:49:59.990" style="s2">thing that is that humans form mops and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.380" end="00:50:01.610" style="s2">mops they kill innocent people</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.990" end="00:50:03.590" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that we should</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.610" end="00:50:05.270" style="s2">avoid that was the interpretation the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.590" end="00:50:07.190" style="s2">first thousand years of Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.270" end="00:50:10.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the interpretation of Gerard I</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.190" end="00:50:13.580" style="s2">find a very appealing yes yeah I get</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.940" end="00:50:15.230" style="s2">that but it again if the congregation is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.580" end="00:50:17.030" style="s2">the Holy Spirit and Virgin Mary are</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.230" end="00:50:19.160" style="s2">clothes you can turn one into the Falk</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.030" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">religion and the other one is the sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.160" end="00:50:27.290" style="s2">of mystical correct no but these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:29.060" style="s2">Thomas my point here is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.290" end="00:50:30.980" style="s2">close that&#39;s why it works because you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.060" end="00:50:34.250" style="s2">can actually transfer it because you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.980" end="00:50:36.110" style="s2">just said that by turning ski it Christ</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.250" end="00:50:38.090" style="s2">into the scapegoat finally we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.110" end="00:50:41.270" style="s2">stopped in the lynch mob in here and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.090" end="00:50:44.330" style="s2">lynch mob is the sin so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.270" end="00:50:47.300" style="s2">that sins can be over so the the period</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.330" end="00:50:50.779" style="s2">of sin can have an event a certain date</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.300" end="00:50:53.029" style="s2">when the sin the sin can be over and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.779" end="00:50:55.999" style="s2">to limit scapegoating forever that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.029" end="00:50:57.439" style="s2">that&#39;s your odds point right so by</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.999" end="00:50:59.659" style="s2">turning Christ into the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.439" end="00:51:01.880" style="s2">scapegoat which is an event it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.659" end="00:51:03.709" style="s2">event ology Christianity likes or</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.880" end="00:51:05.779" style="s2">asterism in Judaism and Islam is an</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.709" end="00:51:07.339" style="s2">event illogical religion it&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.779" end="00:51:09.309" style="s2">based on that certain things happen at</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.339" end="00:51:13.279" style="s2">certain times to change history forever</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.309" end="00:51:15.619" style="s2">okay so the cross is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.279" end="00:51:17.150" style="s2">religious event and Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.619" end="00:51:18.829" style="s2">based on it and you have different</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.150" end="00:51:20.630" style="s2">interpretations of what happens and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.829" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is that you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.630" end="00:51:24.380" style="s2">would expect certain stories that are</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:26.630" style="s2">popular with people to be certain</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.380" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">variations be you know six expect</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.630" end="00:51:30.949" style="s2">certain versions of this to be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:32.959" style="s2">among theologians that will be the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.949" end="00:51:34.640" style="s2">ultimate truth to Christianity you would</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.959" end="00:51:37.099" style="s2">expect your minister who preaches to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.640" end="00:51:39.439" style="s2">on a Sunday to be on the truthful side</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.099" end="00:51:41.390" style="s2">whereas you as a listener could probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.439" end="00:51:43.249" style="s2">interpret it quite widely because the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.390" end="00:51:44.779" style="s2">end of the day it is your behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.249" end="00:51:46.579" style="s2">it&#39;s your relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.779" end="00:51:49.390" style="s2">congregation that determines whether</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.579" end="00:51:51.499" style="s2">you&#39;re a good Christian or not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.390" end="00:51:53.989" style="s2">question to be solved the Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.499" end="00:51:56.359" style="s2">how do we limit the scapegoating since</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.989" end="00:52:00.409" style="s2">the scapegoating has cursed humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.359" end="00:52:03.469" style="s2">how do we get out of paganism something</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.409" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">that I mean if we kind of put it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.469" end="00:52:07.309" style="s2">that very concretely then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.630" end="00:52:08.779" style="s2">things make sense and if you if you get</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.309" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">other stories you know Christ died for</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.779" end="00:52:12.140" style="s2">our sins and then it doesn&#39;t work then</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:15.400" style="s2">you can if you believe that and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.140" end="00:52:18.229" style="s2">basically doing some never if you have</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:20.359" style="s2">in trying to explore with the other soul</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">wrasses like Pablo Vasquez and others or</p>

<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:25.729" style="s2">converted like me is they&#39;re all sort of</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.729" end="00:53:29.539" style="s2">question Christianity is so so solved it</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.769" end="00:53:32.180" style="s2">it didn&#39;t solve it you ask the Jews they</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.539" end="00:53:34.130" style="s2">had programs but we undoubtedly had</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.180" end="00:53:35.630" style="s2">longer periods for peace we undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.130" end="00:53:37.369" style="s2">had less scapegoating we undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.630" end="00:53:40.009" style="s2">became more civilized because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.369" end="00:53:42.289" style="s2">Christianity it did we did benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.009" end="00:53:44.059" style="s2">it in that sense even his song could</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.289" end="00:53:45.589" style="s2">probably claim that compared to some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.059" end="00:53:48.289" style="s2">the more pagan religions it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.589" end="00:53:50.210" style="s2">eradicated but I wouldn&#39;t count on Islam</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.289" end="00:53:52.009" style="s2">having such a great tracker but don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:53:53.809" end="00:53:57.859" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying that Christianity sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.390" end="00:54:02.989" style="s2">of brought us out of the Dark Ages and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.859" end="00:54:05.630" style="s2">so no no no even try no wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.989" end="00:54:07.279" style="s2">yeah yeah okay I agree compared to a</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.630" end="00:54:09.979" style="s2">certain pagan alternative to certainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.279" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">much more bloody okay you get rid of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.549" end="00:54:27.589" style="s2">scapegoating better and it didn&#39;t do so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.190" end="00:54:29.869" style="s2">by creating a scapegoat like Judaism and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.589" end="00:54:32.180" style="s2">Christianity later did</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.890" end="00:57:41.150" style="s2">contemplation practices and certainly a</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.740" end="00:57:46.490" style="s2">working on right now so you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.180" end="00:57:48.380" style="s2">third Eastern religion that we could</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.490" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">induce the West properly those things</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.380" end="00:57:50.510" style="s2">are still lacking</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:52.940" style="s2">that&#39;s what Buddhism and ours are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.510" end="00:57:54.920" style="s2">well but these are these are fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.940" end="00:57:56.690" style="s2">times um so it&#39;s a good example right I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.920" end="00:57:58.250" style="s2">mean dungeon comes from the east and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.690" end="00:58:00.290" style="s2">came from the West</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.250" end="00:58:02.600" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s blending with New Age with</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.290" end="00:58:04.700" style="s2">philosophy with with peers and with all</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.600" end="00:58:06.410" style="s2">kinds of stuff right and then it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.700" end="00:58:09.110" style="s2">reflects back to the East right so we</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.410" end="00:58:10.730" style="s2">have this this enormous creative energy</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.110" end="00:58:12.500" style="s2">going on and many people are coming you</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.730" end="00:58:14.810" style="s2">know that&#39;s not real Tantra and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.500" end="00:58:16.610" style="s2">New Age and this is that but I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.810" end="00:58:18.620" style="s2">it&#39;s great I mean this is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.610" end="00:58:20.930" style="s2">creative cauldron and it seems also that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.620" end="00:58:22.700" style="s2">a lot of the religions they have it seem</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.930" end="00:58:25.460" style="s2">that religions have different different</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.700" end="00:58:28.370" style="s2">emphases right so and John Cobb has</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.460" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">written about that process theologian</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.370" end="00:58:33.650" style="s2">and so so what can I say if you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:35.960" style="s2">religions that are focused on process</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.650" end="00:58:39.410" style="s2">you know process religions who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.960" end="00:58:40.610" style="s2">like try to to emphasize the the process</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.410" end="00:58:42.650" style="s2">nature of the world right most</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.610" end="00:58:44.690" style="s2">definitely Buddhism and Hinduism to some</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.650" end="00:58:49.130" style="s2">extent I probably saw Austrian ISM as</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.690" end="00:58:51.650" style="s2">well yeah and then you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.130" end="00:58:53.890" style="s2">religions who are who are who are more</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.650" end="00:58:56.390" style="s2">concerned with potential so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.890" end="00:58:58.460" style="s2">every of choices how do I make the right</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.390" end="00:59:00.650" style="s2">choice in Christianity the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.460" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">religions are very much are very much</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.650" end="00:59:04.910" style="s2">about about a Bastas potential and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:07.490" style="s2">you finally have ever religions in like</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.910" end="00:59:09.290" style="s2">that are with pattern so that is how</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.490" end="00:59:11.030" style="s2">does the world work that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.290" end="00:59:13.750" style="s2">science science is one of these one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.030" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">these if you want to call it a religion</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.750" end="00:59:17.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say generalize tradition where</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.460" style="s2">were very much obsessed with like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.690" end="00:59:24.890" style="s2">the pattern of the world that we can use</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.460" end="00:59:27.320" style="s2">to make predictions and to to to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.890" end="00:59:29.600" style="s2">things done so and you need these these</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.320" end="00:59:33.830" style="s2">three so I mean you see honestly never</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.600" end="00:59:35.870" style="s2">appealed to me at all before I studied</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.830" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">Buddhism it was only through Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.870" end="00:59:39.530" style="s2">that I could finally understand what</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:41.960" style="s2">were the the value of Christianity life</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.530" end="00:59:43.320" style="s2">and and I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s and this</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.960" end="00:59:46.440" style="s2">is going on</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.320" end="00:59:48.330" style="s2">in all no grand-scale in the West right</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.440" end="00:59:50.040" style="s2">so people are studying Buddhism they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.330" end="00:59:51.750" style="s2">studying Hinduism they&#39;re going back to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.040" end="00:59:54.210" style="s2">Christianity they&#39;re obviously there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.750" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">lot of science going on so people have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.210" end="00:59:58.200" style="s2">tendency to be very optimistic about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="01:00:00.840" style="s2">world and of course there are reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.200" end="01:00:03.420" style="s2">be pessimistic but have there ever been</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.840" end="01:00:05.220" style="s2">a rose in the history of mankind where</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.420" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">there was so much exchange of</p>
