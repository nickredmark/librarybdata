<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">madness of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">and so as everybody as everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">probably saw</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">actually two days ago on the fourth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">july kanye west announced that he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:28.319" style="s2">going to run for president of the united</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:30.400" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.319" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s just very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.400" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">in january i think it was in january</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">2020 i when or</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.599" style="s2">late 2019 i forget when kanye put out</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">his album</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.599" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">i actually started talking about kanye</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">west quite a bit i did three videos on</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">and it was actually the strange moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">where that there was a newsweek article</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">written about my take on kanye west for</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">some reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:58.480" style="s2">and it just plays in everything nicely</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">plays into what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.480" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">and my contention for the past few years</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">is that we are in we&#39;re at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">you know you can see it how big as big</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">as you want to see it you know whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:12.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the end of western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.080" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">end of one cycle of western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">the end of the enlightenment the end i</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know when for sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some there are many images which</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">are showing us that we&#39;re at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">and the the breakdown in meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">breakdown in unity</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">the and then also the the inversions</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">the fact that things keep flipping on</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">one side and the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">is a sign that we are you know can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">imagine like a wheel that&#39;s turning</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">and as it turns if you can imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">wheel gets bigger and bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">you know the bigger it gets at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">point the wheel is going to start to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">wobble</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">it is going to start to to lose its</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">coherence and that seems to be the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">where we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:57.840" style="s2">and in the ancient the ancients had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">vision of the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.840" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">and every culture had the same vision</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">that where they saw themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">let&#39;s say a center or an identity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">some kind and then as you moved out from</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">that identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">you had progressively stranger and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">stranger people</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:14.480" style="s2">obviously more people who were more</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">appeared stranger to you because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.480" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">were more different from you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">and then as you moved out and out you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">reached the monsters which were</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">you know these things that didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">how you didn&#39;t have name names for</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">the things that appeared to you as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">and then the further you went then you</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">reached the edge of the world where</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">you would see what appeared to you as</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">upside down behavior</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">the greeks of course had the uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">the amazons were the ultimate example</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">for the greeks because the greeks were</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">uh let&#39;s say male dominated and so they</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">had this image of something at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">of the world this tribe at the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">the world which was the opposite of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">and which was female dominated females</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">the the women were warriors and the men</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.639" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">barely around or barely important in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">that society and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">that that that type of inversion can</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">play many roles like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:08.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to take on</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">one form it can take on many forms</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">but it it has its image in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">the the vision of the world like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">kind of cosmic vision</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">but it also appears in our society as</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:23.919" style="s2">in terms of a fringe element of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">society and i&#39;ve used the carnival as</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.919" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">the ultimate example where</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">the carnival aesthetic seems to embody</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">mostly this fringe you know the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">of turning faster and faster</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">the notion of the freak show the note</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">all these images of the carnival</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">the clown the the acrobatics the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">idea of turning and turning and turning</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">and so i the fact that things are so</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:48.880" style="s2">unstable is</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">that&#39;s when we&#39;re starting to see these</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.880" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">these elements</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">come into play now the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">the breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">is that there are also movements to try</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">to clamp down</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">and those two end up happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">same time and the danger that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">that we fall into is to want to take one</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">side or the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">we seem to think that we need to decide</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">which side we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:15.039" style="s2">either we&#39;re on the side of those who</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">want to break down the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.039" end="00:06:18.240" style="s2">or on the side of those who want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">clamp things down and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">hold on for dear life you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">extreme versions of identity and extreme</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">versions of uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">of holding in and so we&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna get worse i just wanna warn</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">you it&#39;s gonna get a lot worse</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.960" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">but we&#39;ve started to see this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">playing out</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">and 2020 so when i made that video was</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">when i made that video about kanye west</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">in 2019 or early 2020 i told everybody i</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">hold hold on for 2020 because it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">to be crazy</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">but i have to admit that i didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:55.199" style="s2">so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">to be happening in so little time but i</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.199" end="00:06:57.039" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">at the same time i&#39;m not completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.039" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">surprised um</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing this test of identity now</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">people don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">how a disease or how the pandemic was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:14.880" style="s2">test of identity or was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">question of identity i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.880" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">people can now</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:19.280" style="s2">start to perceive it as they might have</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">perceived how</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.280" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">people&#39;s let&#39;s say even their alignment</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">in terms of what they would do for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">ended up being more on political lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">rather than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">you know because the facts are so fluid</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">and they keep coming at it from all</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">these directions</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">people ended up taking taking political</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">lines for medical</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">in with medical uh medical veneer let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">but the reason why it&#39;s such a question</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">of identity</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">is because there&#39;s an analogy and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.000" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">scary analogy</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">but there is an analogy between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">and the the body politic there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">analogy between a human being and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">and so just like</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">and you you can try to break that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">analogy down but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">you it we&#39;re made to experience that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:12.080" style="s2">analogy</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">and what ended up happening with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.080" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">was ended up being a question of walls</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">it ended up being a question of where</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">do you put the walls and that was is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve been discussing that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">had donald trump saying build the wall</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">and then you had justin trudeau saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">diversity is our strength it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">these two opposites like one is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:32.560" style="s2">build a wall the other is no identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.560" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">just identity no identity this this</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">type of rhetoric that we could see</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">coming up on on on both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">political aisle</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">well the pandemic put that right into</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">your body</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">and it made it it linked the whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">meaning crisis into our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">and so the question became where do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">put the wall</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">how hard do we make the wall and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">is the wall where is the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">wall</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">right and so because you could have said</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:06.720" style="s2">well do we close down</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">borders for countries do we close down</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.720" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">borders</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">hierarchically in terms of we we see</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:13.120" style="s2">where the breakouts are and then we shut</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">down walls</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.120" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">in different places or do we shut down</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">walls all the way down to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:20.320" style="s2">and we separate everybody from each</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">and so that is if you want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">a lot of the debate that was happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">that was part of the large debate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">was going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">now the one that ended up winning seems</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">to have been the one where we separate</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">everybody from each other and we create</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">little as little uh fragmented bits</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">as possible and we shut down everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">now shutting down everything is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">interesting because the things we shut</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">are a lot of the things that people use</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say to manifest their their</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">communal</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">aspect you know obviously we shut down</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">meetings we shut down churches we shut</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">down stores</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">we also shut down sports sports is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">huge deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s bigger than a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">think because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain type of person which</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">really needs to identify</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">which really need to identify to have an</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">enemy and to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">fight and sports is actually a great way</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">to channel that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">so that you actual that you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">conflict because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">give people the possibility of saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">this is my team i love my team</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">those that other team we&#39;re gonna beat</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">them you know and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a less dangerous way of fun</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">obviously it can get out of control we</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">can see that in in england with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">hooligans and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s the less dangerous way to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">funnel identity and conflict</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">than let&#39;s say a social conflict but we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">took that away we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">took that away from everybody and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">everybody was just</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">in their home separated from each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">completely apart and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">something happened now it could have</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">other things but the thing that happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">made sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">the obviously the political narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">that has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">that has been prevalent in universities</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">that have been prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">in uh in society in general</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">this idea of of a kind of neutral like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.360" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">a kind of rule of the margin you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">say and so we identified someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">we watched him get murdered and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:37.920" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">when&#39;s the last time you watch someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">actually get murdered</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">we don&#39;t watch people get murdered we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">watch it on tv we watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">movies but most of the time those images</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">are taken away from us</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">like most of the time we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">permitted by media or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">and for some good reason to watch</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">someone be killed</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">but for some reason this this video</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">extremely available for everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">watch a man</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">be murdered during eight minutes</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">and then then there was a catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">explosion</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">because what happened in that murder</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">what happened in that murder is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.440" style="s2">a catharsis it&#39;s exactly a classical</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:25.440" style="s2">catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.440" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">because what we were asked to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.440" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">especially the white people like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">especially the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">especially the westerners were asked to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">identify with the victim</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">like obviously you want to identify with</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">the victim because</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">you you see this man suffer and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">like this is unbearable</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">i can&#39;t stand watching someone be</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">tortured to death and it&#39;s driving you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">but then you&#39;re also asked to identify</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">with the killer</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">and you&#39;re supposed to do that at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.959" style="s2">same time you&#39;re supposed to both</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">identify with the person who&#39;s murdered</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.959" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">and identify with the killer and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">the the i&#39;ll give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">another place where that happens it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">the story of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">of christ that&#39;s another place where</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.720" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">that happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">where you&#39;re supposed to both identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">with christ</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">being killed but you&#39;re also supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">identify with those who killed christ</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">and so it was exactly a catharsis and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">it led to a a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">ex ecstatic explosion it led to an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">and then people rushed into the streets</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">to protest to commune to commune</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:37.040" style="s2">in the name of this cathartic moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">to commune in the shadow of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.040" end="00:13:41.839" style="s2">catharsis</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">and all the images we saw the chanting</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.839" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">the kneeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">the the there were some crazier images</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">in that there were people being whipped</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">there were people washing the feet of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">others there were</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">all these religious expressions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">of communion in the name of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">cathartic moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">and in the name of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:07.279" style="s2">of inclusivity you could say i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">know how to name the value you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.279" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">call it inclusivity something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">uh and there and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">scapegoating it&#39;s just inevitable there</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">was scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">in the scent and it&#39;s weird scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">because if you look at how the event</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">played through</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">uh like if you&#39;re trying to stay cool it</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">was hard to stay cool during that time</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">but if you looked at how the event</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">played out</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">you could see that everybody agreed that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">this was horrible</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">everybody i don&#39;t think i ever i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">think i saw anybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">who thought it was not horrible i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">saw i saw that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">the man was arrested that the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">were put on i think they might have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">arrested too i don&#39;t even know but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">know they were for sure fired</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">and then everybody denounced it every</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">conservative every liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">every politician at every level</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">denounced it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">then every corporation denounced it i</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:02.399" style="s2">received emails from every single</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">corporation that exists</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.399" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">you know denouncing what happened and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">but for somehow</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">some reason there was still this idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">all of these people everybody basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">who hated what to see this happen we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:18.639" style="s2">the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">and we&#39;re the we&#39;re the we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.639" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">resistance to the evil system</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">and we need to find those that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">responsible for the evil system</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">and because they&#39;re the system then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">can purge them</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re totally justified in purging</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">them because we&#39;re the victims</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">and if we&#39;re the victims and the culprit</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">then even better reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">to now find those who are more</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">responsible than us and purge them from</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">and so it was it was just a classical</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.759" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">scapegoating and it was a weird</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">scapegoating too because it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">it was like it&#39;s always like this these</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">weird these like</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">shadowy figures that we never hear names</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">of it&#39;s like this evil system with like</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">evil white supremacists that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">managing it but it&#39;s like who are these</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">people i mean i guess donald trump is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">who who is kind of seen as the the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">to point to but in general it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:12.399" style="s2">very much a kind of weird scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">um and so it really did lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">pseudo-religious uh event</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">and i and and one of and the final</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">marker of the pseudo-religious event is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">the human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:28.639" style="s2">the human sacrifice is the the clincher</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">which makes it a religious event so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.639" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">and you have to you have to see the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">human sacrifice within</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s not even about being objective</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">or whatever or</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.000" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">the so cert a certain group of people or</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">and then they said you</p>

<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">not killing people</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">but because we are subjecting this to a</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.880" style="s2">this is a higher value protesting racism</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.880" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">higher it is the ultimate value</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">under which we are ready to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">all other values underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">and we are also willing to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">and of course it wasn&#39;t conscious no one</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">said we&#39;re doing human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">but the pattern of human sacrifice was</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">being played out in their own narrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">um and so that is why everything looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">so weird</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">and so religious because it played it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">followed a a very religious uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">now of course it&#39;s it&#39;s a frightening</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a little frightening</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">in terms of pattern because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">clear how it&#39;s going to play out</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear how the catharsis is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.880" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">completely resolved</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s resolved in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">in the story of christ there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">capacity for resolution right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">capacity for forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a capacity to come into</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">full communion with each other um</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">i&#39;m i don&#39;t know if in this religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">moment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">really a capacity for absolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">if there is i haven&#39;t seen it yet like i</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen the capacity for absolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">and so it is a little frightening to uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">to watch this happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">and so it&#39;s going to continue uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">going to continue because</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">it this year&#39;s way it&#39;s far from being</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">over there&#39;s still an election</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">and now you have this fool character</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">kanye west who really does play the role</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:03.440" style="s2">of a fool uh who is now tossed in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:05.760" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.440" end="00:19:07.280" style="s2">so what he so he is the real trump card</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.760" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">way more than donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.280" end="00:19:10.559" style="s2">he is way more a trump card than trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">and so and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.559" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because people are saying</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">steal the votes from trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">because he is he who knows because</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">people he&#39;s presenting himself as like a</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">important to realize that black lives</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.000" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">matter</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">wanted to signal</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">that it is about inclusion and it is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">just about</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">not just about uh racism there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a bigger aspect to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">that is not just</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not only captured by racism mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">yes so what i was going to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">is it a positive value like conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">or is it like a negative value like you</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:52.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">not this like anti-racism or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">and you think it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">inclusion positive value that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">being gestured in this ecstasy</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">well it&#39;s inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">inclusion is not a positive value</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">it can be positive and it can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">negative it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">the function of the margin and the</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">to be equal to the rule</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t work that type of</p>

<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">will break the system it&#39;ll break</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">because in order to crea in order to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">take something marginal and try to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">it equal to the rule</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">the only way to do it is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">flip to make it upside down is to</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">is to make the margin the rule it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">because it naturally it just it just</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">there are things in the world which are</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">just naturally marginal that are just</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">that are just freaky that are just</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">happen once in a while that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">and and they have a power which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.240" end="00:23:33.120" style="s2">useful in the world like they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">useful for society</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.120" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">that we have these that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">freak shows that we have the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">things that are that are strange on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">on the edges but if you try to make so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:43.279" style="s2">here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">let me phrase it in a way let me phrase</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.279" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">it in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">that is easy to understand but is scary</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">in its implications</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:56.080" style="s2">and so you have a a country</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">right and this country has a limit</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.080" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">right and then on the outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">country then you have everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">strange all the strangers all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:03.520" style="s2">foreigners now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">innumerable and they have they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.520" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">multiple identities</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">they have an indefinite amount of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">identities because the outside is always</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">bigger than the inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">and so what happens when you want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">make the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">more important than that which is inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">or if you want the stranger to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">equally included on the inside as the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">then you it things get loopy very fast</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">because you end up having you end up ha</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">because the the one who&#39;s inside has a</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">has a natural advantage on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">because they&#39;re on the inside they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">part of the group they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">identity it doesn&#39;t matter which</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">which type it could be a knitting club</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">or it could be a soccer club or it could</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">be a country</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">or a sadly it can also be things like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:52.320" style="s2">race or</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">things like a religion it can be all</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.320" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">kinds of things now</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">if you want now to include everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">you have to do it in a way to you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:05.840" style="s2">prioritize that which is outside because</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">that which is outside</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.840" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">inside naturally has advantage so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">end up prioritizing that which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.120" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">and then things get crazy loopy things</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">start because then what is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s all gonna fall apart it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">inevitably gonna fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">i always kind of joke like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">knitting group</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">and then and then there&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know like betty has a friend in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">her knitting group who comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.480" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">knitting group but she doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">knit right she&#39;s just there</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:36.400" style="s2">to hang out or maybe to talk to others</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">because she likes people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.400" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">totally fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">uh but then what if you you want her to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">be equal to all the other members of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">knitting group</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">it&#39;s going to get really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">because then she says well i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">to knit</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">i want to do something else like i want</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">to play play</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">bowling or something so it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">well once in a while we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">bowling event because</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">we want to include you in the group but</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">at some point it&#39;s going to start to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">break down you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">anyways that that&#39;s that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">of the of the oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">that can be that&#39;s the danger of equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">inclusion it just it just</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">can&#39;t just can&#39;t work in terms of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to pivot to some</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">questions a lot of good questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">popping up</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.159" end="00:27:34.559" style="s2">is that the fool is the one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">who turns things you know so the image</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.559" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">of the clown is perfect he&#39;s on a ball</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">he&#39;s rolling a ball he&#39;s juggling</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">uh and so the fool is the one who turns</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">things and so when</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">when things are going well what the full</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">tia tends to do is to turn things upside</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.200" style="s2">right to show the upside down of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">something so the king is all pompous and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.200" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">is is extremely proud of himself and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">the king will lift up</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">the his skirt and will point to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">thing that&#39;s hidden right he&#39;ll point to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:03.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">to the to the hidden things which are in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.440" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">the shadows let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">and so the clown is always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">turning things right and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">emphasizing excess</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">caricature all of that now</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">the the problem is that when the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">is upside down</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">then what&#39;s the role of the clown when</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">everything is already topsy-turvy</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">what does the clown do well the clown</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">keeps turning</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">the clown will turn things and so what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve been trying to point out is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">when the world is is upside down watch</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">the fools because the fools</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">are the ones who are actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">turn things right side up</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">um who are going to turn things back</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:48.240" style="s2">towards order</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">and so i saw that already in kanye</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.240" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">a long time ago in 2004 he did this song</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">called jesus walks</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">which was a really strange song because</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a song about</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">about street life and hustling and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">but then he&#39;s he he talks about how</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">jesus walks with the lowest basically so</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">you know he&#39;s talking about he needs to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">go do a drug deal and he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">leave his mom to do a drug deal</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">and he says i hope that jesus walks with</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">me and so he&#39;s connecting like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">highest thing with the lowest okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">um so i was really i&#39;ve been watching</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">him since then</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">and now he he basically became</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">like a conservative christian</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">he he had a conversion experience and uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">he&#39;s now he&#39;s all like pro family pro</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">ev he&#39;s he&#39;s all about uh he&#39;s ex</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">he&#39;s become super conservative um and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">he&#39;s not the first one for who that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve been watching certain characters in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">in the past few years one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">examples i give is gavin mcginnis who</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">obviously he&#39;s been really really kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">of thrown around in the media but</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">as a character he was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">because he founded vice news</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">and he was he was a he was a punk he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">a punk</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">pervert all this stuff and all this</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">at some point it&#39;s like the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">became like him what does a punk do when</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">the whole world is punk rock</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">and so he he actually he&#39;s like i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">stand this and then he started to point</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:20.000" style="s2">the to the to normalcy got married</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:21.360" style="s2">had kids became a knights of columbus uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.000" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">you know started wearing buttoned up</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.360" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">shirts and it&#39;s like he was just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">the when when the the world is</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">exceptional the exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">points back to the rule it happens very</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">naturally and so kanye i think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what kanye is doing so if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">look at his tweet it&#39;s crazy because he</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">we need i forget the exact wording but</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like we need to follow god and to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">our unifying principle or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m running for</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">president of the united states that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">kanye west</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">who is writing that like you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">guy</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">the guy who would dress up in a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">teddy bear suit that guy</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">that guy is saying we need to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">god and find our unifying principle</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what i mean when i talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">about the fool kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">watching the fool at the end because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">fool is the one who&#39;s going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">to bring back order for i mean whether</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">you agree with the order he brings back</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.919" style="s2">that&#39;s not even the point to watch it as</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">a phenomena is to to just see it happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.919" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">kanye west is more conservative than</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:22.880" style="s2">donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">that&#39;s how weird this world is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:33.600" style="s2">all right does that help i understand a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">little bit what i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.600" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">do you have any follow-up questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">no thank you okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">jacob you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s my mic working yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">hi jonathan um</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">so my question is to do with what</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">what is the relationship between the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:05.519" style="s2">um movement and the christian substrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">in the kind of unconscious layer</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.519" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">and just one more piece i want to attack</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">on to this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">if we&#39;re kind of stepping back to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">the mid 19th century around like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">um and if this movement has kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">marxist foundations</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">and what&#39;s the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">marxist foundations</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">and christianity as well with marxism</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:33.840" style="s2">kind of coming out of the same substrate</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">so any anything that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.840" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">what i would i&#39;ve tried to point to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">is that the modern world is basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">the breakdown of christianity and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s there historically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:49.279" style="s2">what it is you know it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">the rise of scientific atheism the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.279" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">rise of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">of uh just a basic cultural atheism you</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">could say</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:58.080" style="s2">or secularism and so what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.080" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">what happens in that breakdown of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.840" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">is that christianity starts to pull</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">apart and so certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">christianity start to manifest</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">there is an aspect of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">which is an attention to the little one</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">right attention to the poor um</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">and a desire for</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:25.840" style="s2">a form of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">i would say it that way i would say</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">right christ goes out finds the lost</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.640" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">sheep</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">yeah the the there&#39;s all these images in</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">christianity obviously just the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">beatitudes are</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">a lot about that and so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:47.760" style="s2">value in itself is good but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">dangerous if it&#39;s just taking taken on</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.760" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very dangerous um and that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:56.159" style="s2">one of the aspects of marxism is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.159" end="00:34:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a desire for when we</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">know it it&#39;s like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a utopian</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.039" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">desire it&#39;s a desire for</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">a certain aspect of utopia and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">their their vision of utopia is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">of equality</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">utopia and then there are other utopias</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">and we saw them in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:19.760" style="s2">which are hierarchical utopias</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">and so those two are gonna now those two</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.760" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">are what led to world war</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:27.599" style="s2">ii a hierarchical utopia and an</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.480" end="00:34:30.159" style="s2">an and an egalitarian utopia</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.599" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to see it happen again</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.159" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">because we never dealt with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same movements it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">hilarious it&#39;s it&#39;s not funny but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">because you you want to you go you go</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">online and look for antifa images from</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">the 1920s in germany</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">you&#39;ll be surprised that that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">the one of the things that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">to to where germany ended up was</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">the very same questions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">dealing with now</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:03.839" style="s2">and people are really struggling because</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a desire for a secular utopia</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.839" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">and so the idea in the religious context</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">if the highest thing is the highest</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">thing so i say it&#39;s like i say the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">highest thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.280" style="s2">is the infinite or the highest thing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.280" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">or the highest thing is love right being</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">infinite then</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not a value in terms of morality</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.800" style="s2">right it&#39;s something beyond the value in</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">terms of morality</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">morality will flow out of it um</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">but but it&#39;s not an absolute it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not a value</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re seeing now is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">there is definitely the blm is</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">definitely marxist like the the founders</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">are marxist</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">their desires are extremely marxist in</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">their formulations</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re using i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:56.800" style="s2">conscious it is but they&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">used</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">using kind of religious imagery to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">on board and to get people excited about</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">about their project and so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">but there is no there is no happy ending</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">to this to that story</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">like that there is no happy ending to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">what to what blm</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">is asking for it can&#39;t end well</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">so relatedly amy you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">yeah hi jonathan sorry it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:34.079" style="s2">thunderstorm here i hope uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to hear me yeah i had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.079" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">about the kind of uh what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">noticing about this kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship i see between</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">text and image and the pseudo-religious</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">um and i was wondering if you thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">that it connected to the past</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">and that there seems to be a dual uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">call to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.000" style="s2">for iconoclasm to destroy images in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.880" style="s2">form of statues</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.000" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">and also to worship certain new texts</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the right fragility is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">like the best-selling book in the united</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:06.839" style="s2">states right now so i wonder if we had</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">any thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.839" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">yeah well one of the when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">the end of something</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">one of the images of the end is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">iconoclasm</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">that is when something breaks down you</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:23.119" style="s2">you want to break down the memory of it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">because you the image i often give is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.119" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">if you if you buy a house and you when</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">you move into the house</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">you find that people have left pictures</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">of their family there</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">the first thing you&#39;re going to do is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">you&#39;re going to remove the pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">the people&#39;s family so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">settle</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">in now that has normal implications but</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">it also has very dark implications if</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">you play it out in terms of social</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.160" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">social questions now</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we&#39;re it&#39;s not like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">switch of house but it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:53.599" style="s2">people who are trying to break down the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">identity of the family break down the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.599" end="00:37:57.839" style="s2">identity of those</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">that have held the house until now and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.839" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">so when you see iconoclasm</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a it&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a transition towards other</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">statues</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a transition for you to put then</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:15.599" style="s2">other ideals up there for people to to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">venerate</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.599" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">so and some of the stuff that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">pulling down maybe should be pulled down</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.839" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">like there&#39;s some you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">there&#39;s some dark stuff in the u.s south</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">maybe i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not i&#39;m not it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:29.920" style="s2">not my thing i</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">i&#39;m canadian i&#39;m french canadian i have</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.920" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">other markers</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">you know there are people there are like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">there are people here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">curry label here in canada and there are</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">statues of him</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">and there are some dark aspects to his</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">story but to be honest i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">would be a good idea to pull down</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">his statue because he did found you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">large swaths of the north here</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:50.960" style="s2">but there are dark aspects and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.960" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">the way that i framed it too is the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">idea of of hiding</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">the nakedness of your father and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">in the world of all identities</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.240" style="s2">are no identity is perfect all</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">identities</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.240" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">are broken because they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">not let&#39;s say they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.440" style="s2">god right and so all identities have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">brokenness to them</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.440" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">and so in order in order for them to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">hold together one of the things you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">to do is you have to hide their</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">and i take that from the story in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">bible where noah</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:25.280" style="s2">the father the new father right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a flood everything&#39;s destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.280" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">now there&#39;s noah he&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">father of everybody else right the whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">world is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">is going to be related to noah and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">he gets drunk and he passes out naked in</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">his tent</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">and one of his sons sees him naked and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">makes fun of him</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:41.760" style="s2">because he&#39;s naked and then he&#39;s cursed</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">because of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.760" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">now his other sons go in and they hide</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">his nakedness they cover his nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">so you have to understand it as in order</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:53.920" style="s2">to preserve an identity you have to to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.920" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">hide the nakedness of your father</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">the the problem is always knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">is it too much</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">like when are you hiding too much but</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">everybody does it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">right imagine you have a basketball team</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">and your star player has some</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">negative aspects to them well you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">want to be publicly telling everybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">the bad habits of your star basketball</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:19.200" style="s2">player because you won&#39;t you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">your basketball team</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.200" end="00:40:22.400" style="s2">to be dismantled and you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">lose and it&#39;s the same for</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.400" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">any team any church any school any group</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:31.119" style="s2">and so we need to hide the nakedness of</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.319" style="s2">our father</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.119" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">but at some point and so at some point</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.319" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">you have to stop if it&#39;s too much right</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">because we saw too much of it like all</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">priests abusing children and then people</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">covering up for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">all the coaches abusing children all</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">that kind of stuff is when you do it too</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:47.119" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">now the problem is that if you hide the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.119" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">nakedness of your father</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s still there the scandal is hidden</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s still there</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">and at some point at in the end</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s going to appear it&#39;s going to show</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">the system is going to play itself out</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">the weakness of the system that you hid</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">at the beginning is going to be its</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">downfall</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">at the end and it&#39;s going to be what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">your enemies use to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s just inevitable it&#39;s just going</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">to happen that way and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">america has sins in its origin</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">it has hidden sins and the hidden sin is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">that that which they declared which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:32.880" style="s2">equality fraternity uh freedom</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">in their founding they hid a sin which</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.880" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">is that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">true for everything that they in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.880" style="s2">in in saying that they also hid their</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.880" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">sins and now they&#39;re coming out and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">they have been coming out</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">that happening at some point now i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">know when</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to happen but it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">for that to not to not happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.200" style="s2">but it and we have to be careful not to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">point fingers because</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.200" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">this what i&#39;m telling you is true of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">every system</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s true of every family and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">true of every</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">any organization has hidden since</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">um it&#39;s just part of a system</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">okay so we have a lot of questions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">not gonna get to all of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">but we&#39;ve got dominic you got a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.640" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">sure thanks hi jonathan hey can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">point us the stories</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">in anticipation of the inclusion or</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">of those who don&#39;t choose the side of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">either the breakdown or the clampdown</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">if i can find those that don&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.560" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">either or</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">it usually ends up in the stores usually</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">don&#39;t look they don&#39;t look very pretty</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">they don&#39;t end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">so okay i&#39;ll give you i&#39;ll give an</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">example where both sides are shown</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">next to each other okay um so</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">it&#39;s in the story of exodus in the story</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">of exodus</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">the israelites leave egypt</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">and when they leave egypt they gather</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">all the rabble with them</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">as these slay as these israelite slaves</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">are being freed and are leaving israel a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">bunch of people were like well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">getting in on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">and so they like gathered a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">of mixed</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:18.319" style="s2">people and who who knows like who they</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">were but just a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">and so they come into the desert and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">the the israelites complained that they</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have what they need they complain</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">they complain</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">and then at some point they complain too</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">much it doesn&#39;t matter for what</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">the idea is that they complain too much</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">and it says in scripture that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:39.839" style="s2">mixed multitude</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">that complained too much and you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.839" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">why that would happen because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">if you don&#39;t feel like this is yours</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:48.960" style="s2">like if you don&#39;t feel you&#39;re part of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.160" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.960" end="00:43:53.680" style="s2">then you have it&#39;s easier to complain</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.160" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">because you&#39;re not covered by the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.680" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">advantages of the group as much</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:59.200" style="s2">you have less cover from the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s easier for you to complain and</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.200" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">it&#39;s normal that you&#39;ll be the one who</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">complains the longest who are complains</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">right um and then in scripture what</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">is god ends up giving them what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">complain about</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">but he purges the edge of the camp</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a purr like a fire that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">burns the edge of the camp</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.640" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">okay that&#39;s some scary stuff man i told</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:25.599" style="s2">you it&#39;s scary stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">now right after that story like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.599" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">chapter right after that short</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">story there&#39;s a there&#39;s a balance to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">which is that moses is married to an</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">ethiopian</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:38.000" style="s2">which like in let&#39;s say in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">thinking the ethiopian was like</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.000" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">the ultimate foreigner right we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">even know exactly who what actual people</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">they were referring to</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">but it was like referring to those</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">people really that live like on the edge</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">of the world like they&#39;re so far we</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly like they&#39;re very far</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">and so he was married to an ethiopian</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">and the the idea is that she was dark</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">like she was dark skinned you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.119" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">in the story that she was dark skinned</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">moses&#39;s sister complains about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:06.079" style="s2">that he&#39;s married to a foreigner and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">married to an ethiopian</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.079" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">and then because of that she gets a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">disease which is that she becomes</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">too white her skin becomes white like</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">snow</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">and because she becomes white like snow</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.480" style="s2">she has to be excluded</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">from the group and she has to be cast</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.480" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">out of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">of the camp because of that so you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">see the two problems like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.599" style="s2">you could call it an excess of mixture</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.359" end="00:45:31.839" style="s2">and an excess of purity</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.599" end="00:45:33.200" style="s2">and those two things happening you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">one after the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.200" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">and almost being like uh like a call</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">upon each other because you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">that after the mixed multitude problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">the reason why miriam was complaining</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">was because well we just had this mixed</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">multitude problem now moses is married</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">to a a stranger</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it one led to the other and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">i would say that in terms of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">going on right now we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:59.200" style="s2">attentive to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">especially because things don&#39;t ever go</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.200" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">just in one direction</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.800" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna go in one direction and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">then they&#39;re gonna snap back</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.800" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">like when nazi when hitler was elected</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">in germany they were on the verge of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">communist revolution</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">it didn&#39;t just happen like it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">just happen</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">when everything was fine it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">pull the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">the pendulum here it gets pulled in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">other way and it&#39;s hard to know which</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">way is going to win</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">like it could have been the other way</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">maybe the com maybe hitler could have</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:30.079" style="s2">failed in his coup and then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">communists could have taken over and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">and and germany could have ended up you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:34.960" style="s2">know sending people to the gulag like</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:37.200" style="s2">who knows</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.960" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">but that&#39;s the problem is that one calls</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.200" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">so i hope that story is at least one</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">example of those two extremes</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:46.319" style="s2">kind of appearing in the story</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">maybe gray you had a question that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:54.160" style="s2">good to</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">piggyback on this one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.160" end="00:46:57.359" style="s2">hi jonathan thanks so much for being</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">here um</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.359" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">my question was about um i i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">know what your perception is but</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">my perception is that most people in</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">secular society don&#39;t really understand</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:10.079" style="s2">secular society to be like broken up</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:12.480" style="s2">cluttered down</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.079" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">christian commitments um and i was just</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.480" end="00:47:17.000" style="s2">wondering if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">that sort of ignorance is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.000" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">exacerbating</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">the sort of dangers that these</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">pseudo-religious events</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:28.240" style="s2">pose for us all yeah i totally think so</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">i think that that our our</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.240" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">the fact that we despise history and uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t know about history is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.559" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">a call for all of this to to keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:40.640" style="s2">getting worse because</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:42.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.640" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">everybody is is moving from one side to</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.880" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:50.319" style="s2">and nobody nobody knows what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not so it ends up having a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.319" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">being a caricature of liturgical events</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">a caricature of the surgical feast the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">of like the ancient celebrations that</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">people used to have but</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">no one knows what&#39;s happening and so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:03.760" style="s2">idea the idea is that these patterns</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:05.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.760" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">this is why like for example like i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.359" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">call out someone like stephen pinker</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">which is that people are saying people</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.280" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">are saying oh look at these</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">these you can see it people some of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">kind of atheist types they look at these</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">events and they&#39;re like oh here again is</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">manifestation of of our religious</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">tendency you know and so they they decry</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">it they&#39;re like oh this is horrible that</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:24.720" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">this is just another example of this</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.720" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">kind of horrible stuff but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s not going to go away because</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">you say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">you know those patterns are in you those</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">patterns are part of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">they&#39;re like the example i always use is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">you can complain that people sleep</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.480" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">because they&#39;re not productive</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">but they&#39;re still going to sleep you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">say if you didn&#39;t sleep you would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">more productive but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">it&#39;s still gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">the question is how does it happen does</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:54.160" style="s2">it happen haphazardly and chaotically</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">and we end up</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.160" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">scapegoating and sacrificing people and</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">and like</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.440" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">beating people in the street or do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">ordered version which is what religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:06.319" style="s2">offers</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:07.920" style="s2">which is what you know this is which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.319" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">what christianity offered but other</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.920" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">religions offer that as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">uh give a a place to funnel all those</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">desires into</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">a kind of dance where instead of</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">actually killing each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">we&#39;re dancing together</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">thanks so much okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">uh aaron rodgerson you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:35.520" style="s2">i feel like that question was just kind</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">healthy way of channeling tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">in a way and i was saying does religion</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">in some sense have the same effect</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:52.800" style="s2">and did religion evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">combat chaos and are we returning to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">pre-religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">time of collapse and chaos in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">well i think religion what religion does</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">is more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not about combating chaos it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">about integrating</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">it all together and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">one of the things that i that i talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:15.359" style="s2">about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">christianity for example like</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.359" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">christianity is a religion where we look</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">at someone who is nailed to a cross</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">what the hell i mean it&#39;s not a just</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">bringing order it&#39;s about integrating</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:32.319" style="s2">right it&#39;s about integrating the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">thing death to</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">all the bad stuff too how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">integrate the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">how do we bring it all together and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">you know as much the order and the light</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:47.359" style="s2">as the death and the darkness we have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:49.520" style="s2">be able to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.359" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">bring it all together or else it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.520" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">to appear in</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">in kind of other ways now this is why</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">this is why</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">the people who try to combat the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say the enlightenment that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">they have a shadow that&#39;s why they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.720" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">as as pika pinker says that counter</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just so hilarious as if you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">avoid it like as if</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">you could have just the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">and not have the counter enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just not how it works that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">how systems work and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">the counter enlightenment is just gets</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">stronger until it explodes</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">and then we have insanity and we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">crazy manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">so so yeah so i think it i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:34.839" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">offers more than just order it offers an</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.839" end="00:51:38.480" style="s2">integration it can be tribalistic too</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">like no doubt i don&#39;t want to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">and it can have tribal it can become</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:46.960" style="s2">tribal and it can have extremely</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">it can be dangerous of course it can but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.960" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:54.720" style="s2">choosing choosing which one is the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">is the least uh is the least going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">destroy everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">thank you all right um</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to read this on stephen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">behalf how could the absolution play out</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">in a culture that seems to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:11.920" style="s2">no one is redeemable</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">uh cancel culture what are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.920" end="00:52:15.920" style="s2">alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">ah i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think that it</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.920" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">can work i don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">i&#39;m really look i hate to say this</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">but the only way for it to work is</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s the way for it to work</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.119" style="s2">and uh and it seems like we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">um but it can escalate seriously</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">escalated to the two minutes of hate</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the only way out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">because the the only way for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">like the white liberal to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:53.680" style="s2">of their let&#39;s say guilt</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">is to find someone who&#39;s more guilty</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.680" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">than them and then turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:59.119" style="s2">scream at them</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">right there&#39;s no other way and so that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.119" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">that will you know that will</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:06.559" style="s2">like pile up if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">watch the the cultural revolution stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.559" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">like the maoist stuff you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">where this goes it&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">you&#39;ll have your people be dragged</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">dragged out into public</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">and publicly humiliated publicly</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know how far it can go in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">in north america but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s scary stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.119" style="s2">and what&#39;s the alternative like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">alternative is is confession the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.119" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">alternative is sacramentality</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">the alternative is real community uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">like one of the roles that let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">like for example i&#39;m orthodox like</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the roles a confession</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">plays</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">a confession is a way to to acquire</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">absolution uh but it involves</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.200" style="s2">accepting a form of hierarchy um</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">so uh i do have we&#39;re almost at the top</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:05.599" style="s2">of the hour can i sneak in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">one more question yeah i&#39;m totally fine</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.599" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m having fun so it&#39;s it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">cool cool cool so yeah on the orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">piece uh let&#39;s see if i can like</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">jam in two questions here so one</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">question is what do you think of our</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">buddies john&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">religion without a religion a religion</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.440" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion however he phrases</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:22.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">and then the other one um because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.319" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">baptized as orthodox christian uh and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">then you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:29.839" style="s2">um you know there&#39;s this reversal with</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">guys like gavin mcginnis or doing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.839" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">360 and kind of like rouge</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">we were talking about the pickup artist</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">that was a wild one he joined our</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.559" style="s2">our religion and then um and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:39.599" style="s2">just i don&#39;t really know this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.559" end="00:54:41.520" style="s2">the ortho bros</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.599" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">you you&#39;ve heard these like these yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.520" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s just rising up</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">um so yeah and so what&#39;s the the genre</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">i&#39;m curious your thoughts on that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">what is your thoughts in the orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">christianity and the role that it could</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.680" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">in this this sort of like ecstasy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.680" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">the ecstasy man well i i think i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">obviously i don&#39;t agree i don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">with the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">i i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">i think that there are certain aspects</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">of humanity which are inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t take them into account</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">because you don&#39;t like them</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">they&#39;re just going to come back it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t avoid it you can try but</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">they&#39;re going to come back and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:28.319" style="s2">and so i understand john&#39;s fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">like his fear of narrative for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.319" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">like i understand his fear of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">because because it can be exclusionary</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">you know because it&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">because it does create identity and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">creates exclusion so i understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">but there&#39;s no way around it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:48.559" style="s2">there&#39;s no way around it it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">come back and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.559" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">so for example so like john john talks</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:55.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">how he doesn&#39;t want narrative but he</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.119" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">does have a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">right he spent 30 hours in his podcast</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">giving us</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:03.280" style="s2">the narrative of his religion without a</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:06.400" style="s2">religion which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.280" end="00:56:09.599" style="s2">the narrative of the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.400" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">breakdown of christianity and the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.599" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">the rise of the enlightenment and now</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">reaching the end and now like in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:18.160" style="s2">post-enlightenment world so there is</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">there is a a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.160" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something of the tower of babel</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">in what he&#39;s trying to do which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">the desire to create a tower that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">includes everything</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have that doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:40.640" style="s2">and it just it&#39;s just not possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">now the idea is to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.640" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">to is to find a way to have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">outside or to have a margin which has a</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">role</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">and which you can encounter and that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">can engage with</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">rather than just try to not have one or</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">not have a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">or just be the margin or just be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">like you need to have the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">you need to have the whole thing so i</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:08.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that it can work um</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">uh i mean can it work individually like</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.319" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">to help people out</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">yeah i think so i think so i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">john has helped a lot of people and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:17.119" style="s2">seen a lot of people really</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">feel like he&#39;s helped them through the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.119" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">meeting crisis and everything and so so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">like i i take</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">anything that helps people get out of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">is great i think it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">so i agree but i i think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">i think that as a let&#39;s say as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">movement or as a kind of social thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say this way let&#39;s say it in</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:38.839" style="s2">evolutionary terms uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">if you have something which is too</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.839" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">something which is specific is going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:44.160" style="s2">come like a needle it&#39;s going to burst</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:46.880" style="s2">your thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.160" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s it and that&#39;s the same so so</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.880" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">if you don&#39;t want to have a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">and you you create this this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">amorphous like</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">uh emergent thing without a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">then those that have a narrative are</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">going to come in and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">slash you to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to take over your</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">territory and it&#39;s just going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">um yeah so as for orthodoxy look at what</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">role can orthodoxy play</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">uh i think like for me i can just talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:16.720" style="s2">for myself look guys like i just talked</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:20.480" style="s2">for myself like</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.720" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">i feel like i felt like i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.480" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">western christianity lost the plot at</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">some point</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">that they lost the higher aspects the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:30.880" style="s2">mystical aspects</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">they lost the the the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.880" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">system of traditional of sacred language</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">they lost they kind of lost it and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:43.280" style="s2">as our own system breaks down so</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">i talk about this idea of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.280" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">foreign or the mixed</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">the mixed multitude or the thing on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:49.680" style="s2">margin so you actually need that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">you need a little bit of it especially</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.680" end="00:58:52.079" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">the system is exhausted you actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.079" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">have to go outside</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">and get some fuel from the outside and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">so my</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">sense is that orthodoxy is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">strange but not too strange</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">in order to to revivify some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:12.319" style="s2">the west</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">you know and so i think that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.319" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">lot to offer and it has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">a lot to offer people who who want to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2">catholic or what even want to remain</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:20.880" style="s2">protestant or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:22.880" style="s2">i think that it can have a lot to offer</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">because it it has enough strangeness</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.880" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">like the evil system that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">fight and it ha</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">it has like that uh it has the the uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">the appeal of the orient you know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">that kind of cliche of like the golden</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:40.160" style="s2">turbine wearing uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">you know like that that imagery that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.160" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">saw you know pop up in the romanticism</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">of like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">the east full of treasures it has enough</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">um but it also has enough connection</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:55.520" style="s2">odd like it&#39;s not completely off you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">not just being an idiosyncrasy</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.520" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">in society you know that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">things that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">struggle with kind of the i call the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">california buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">is that it&#39;s so idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">to be a buddhist in in in america that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">i mean you can do it it&#39;s good it might</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">help you but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s your b you&#39;re still fragmenting the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">thing you&#39;re still participating in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">fragmentation by doing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:20.559" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">things i think orthodoxy can offer</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.559" end="01:00:23.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:27.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very very uh beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:28.799" style="s2">religion if you look into it just</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.280" end="01:00:31.040" style="s2">experience it go to church</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:32.880" style="s2">check it out um do you think it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.040" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">rise too because i i noticed</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.880" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">uh more people are talking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">on the website well</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.880" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s hard because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">hard because we&#39;re all in our bubble but</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">for sure in my perception i&#39;ve had a lot</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">interested and you know uh interested in</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">the mysticism christian just interested</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">in christian mysticism</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">reading the church fathers i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">like i think that some of the key saints</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">some of the key think</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">thoughts in orthodoxy offers really good</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:00:59.760" style="s2">solutions to the problems like i</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">i really think say maximus the confessor</p>

<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">the problems of relevance realization i</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.640" end="01:01:20.319" style="s2">think that uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">sa maximus offers the the most</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.319" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">integrated solution</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:26.319" style="s2">of both bottom up and top-down uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">approach at the same time so</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">from the top you have name identity</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">which kind of comes down</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:33.839" style="s2">and acts as an authority but from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">bottom you also have the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.839" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">of the elements so it&#39;s like the joining</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">the fitting together</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">in love happening at the bottom and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">also the naming the head this image of</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">the top so</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not just top down but it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">just a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">puzzling emergence where it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:51.520" style="s2">you use that word but i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.520" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">like how does it come together you need</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">those two to happen at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.680" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">um so we passed the hour do you want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">sneak in one more question or should we</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">end here it&#39;s up to you guys i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">i&#39;m cool if you still have attention</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s a a good question so</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll ask this one um uh he wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">read it</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:15.359" style="s2">on his behalf as well jordan peterson uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious to get your download on</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.359" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">your thoughts on how jordan&#39;s doing if</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">you watched his recent video with his</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">daughter</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">um so with points by jordan peterson and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:24.960" style="s2">yourself do you believe that the role of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:26.720" style="s2">symbols and myths could be recognized</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.960" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">and integrated in science as we know it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:31.280" style="s2">does science have room or does the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">boundaries of science have to be broken</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.280" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">to accommodate symbols and myths</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">so okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">the way that that myth and and religious</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.000" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">imagery is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.200" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">integrated into science is through</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:51.280" style="s2">the science of of the human being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:55.440" style="s2">through looking back at the human being</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.280" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">and not not ignoring</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.440" end="01:02:58.720" style="s2">the experience of consciousness right</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.720" end="01:03:03.440" style="s2">as we look back on consciousness as we</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">try to use consciousness to look back on</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.440" end="01:03:05.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:07.440" style="s2">then all of a sudden i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.920" end="01:03:10.799" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.440" end="01:03:14.319" style="s2">that these that science can</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.799" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">see the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.319" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">it won&#39;t be scientific right but it can</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">see the the reason for these stories and</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">these patterns and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">and these myths and also understand that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">science itself is always submitted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.720" end="01:03:36.160" style="s2">there&#39;s always a reason why you do</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.160" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">once you when you ask what that reason</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:41.520" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">that&#39;s when you start to see these</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.520" end="01:03:44.799" style="s2">stories come back in</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not in the d it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.799" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">analysis it&#39;s not in the thing but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">the reason why you analyze</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">which is subject to to mythological</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.200" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">right so let give you an example right</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">so we developed the atom bomb but</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">we just developed an atom bomb we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:04.480" style="s2">just develop an atom bomb</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:05.839" style="s2">we were in a war and we had these</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.480" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">enemies and there was a race</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.839" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">who was going to get the atom bomb first</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">and so finally the americans</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">took some of the enemy scientists</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">brought them to themselves</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">and then created this atom bomb so that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">they could defeat</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.039" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">the last remnants of the war and win the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">without that story there&#39;s no atom bomb</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">there is none why would you make an atom</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:28.480" style="s2">bomb</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.160" style="s2">you&#39;d have to be pretty insane to make</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.480" end="01:04:32.480" style="s2">an atom bomb to be honest</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.160" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">you need that narrative in order to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.480" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">to justify the research</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">and so that it so i gave you an extreme</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s like that for everything we</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">always have a reason to study things</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:48.319" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s really really well put</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:50.799" style="s2">um so i think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:52.839" style="s2">end it here uh do you have any closing</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:55.599" style="s2">thoughts for us at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.839" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">stowa well thanks i i</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.599" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">i&#39;m just happy to see people try to</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.920" end="01:05:01.680" style="s2">figure things out</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">and to to ask the hard questions and to</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.680" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">also be willing to talk about things</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:08.240" style="s2">without just letting ourselves be</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:10.559" style="s2">polarized try to see both sides</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.240" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">try to understand at least the reason</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.559" end="01:05:15.039" style="s2">why the two sides</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:16.640" style="s2">appear let&#39;s say in debates and so um</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.039" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">so i appreciate it and i wish you all</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.640" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">the best did you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">stoicism actually because you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:21.680" style="s2">of people say they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">proto-christians</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.680" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if you have any thoughts i</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">do have a thought on socialism</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:30.400" style="s2">my thought on sources is that stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">only works if it&#39;s integrated into</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.400" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">christianity</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">uh for the same reason as what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">talking about in terms of the religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">without a religion</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:43.680" style="s2">i think stoicism offers great</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">practice great advice great moral</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.680" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">uh teaching but because it never offered</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:50.880" style="s2">a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">that i think that it just it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.880" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">win and that&#39;s why i didn&#39;t win</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">and i think that once stoicism became</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:06:00.079" style="s2">integrated within</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">the christian story then that&#39;s when it</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.079" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">actually took on</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:05.359" style="s2">its best fruits that&#39;s when and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">why when people look at</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.359" end="01:06:08.960" style="s2">early christian saints and they say well</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.640" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s just a stoic i&#39;m like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.960" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t mind that i don&#39;t have a problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">because but it&#39;s a he&#39;s a stoic because</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">this is integrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:22.319" style="s2">into also a cosmic story and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.880" style="s2">a social story and a and a communion</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.319" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">a reason to commune and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.880" end="01:06:27.039" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:28.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what made the stoic that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.039" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">made stoicism flower</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.720" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">in the christian age um so that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">think of sources</p>
