<p begin="00:18:31.720" end="00:18:36.840" style="s2">meditate by myself there&#39;s a need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.340" end="00:18:46.450" style="s2">check the time is almost fear-based</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.840" end="00:18:49.090" style="s2">thoughts so I&#39;m wondering what the fear</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.450" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">is the fear that your timer is not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.090" end="00:18:56.200" style="s2">go off appear that you&#39;re wasting your</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.160" end="00:18:58.390" style="s2">time doing this practice there could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.200" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">two different fears for the first one</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.390" end="00:19:06.220" style="s2">the thing you do is and it sounds kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:07.960" style="s2">of silly but it works get your timer</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.220" end="00:19:10.840" style="s2">don&#39;t be meditating set it for 10</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.960" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">minutes just sit there goes up do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.840" end="00:19:16.210" style="s2">again and again and again and again and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:18.580" style="s2">again so that you know I know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.210" end="00:19:23.440" style="s2">mean the intellectual or reflective part</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.580" end="00:19:27.820" style="s2">of you but the more primitive part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.440" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">your brain knows because your limbic</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.820" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">system learns a much slower rate than</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:36.100" style="s2">your cortex and you have to do basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:40.150" style="s2">a lot of training over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.100" end="00:19:46.330" style="s2">again I just know si si si si si si si</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.150" end="00:19:47.500" style="s2">si si if it&#39;s resistance that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.330" end="00:19:49.390" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.500" end="00:19:51.400" style="s2">meditation that you need to apply the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.390" end="00:19:53.800" style="s2">five factors of inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.400" end="00:19:55.300" style="s2">you need to realize that that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.800" end="00:19:56.760" style="s2">meditate immediately on the resistance</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.300" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">in your means you&#39;re already meditating</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.760" end="00:20:01.900" style="s2">and you really need to work on</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.120" style="s2">cultivating the Buddha the Dharma and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.900" end="00:20:08.290" style="s2">the Sangha to build up the inner boot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.120" end="00:20:12.490" style="s2">the momentum also can you taste any</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.290" end="00:20:16.150" style="s2">sense of being centered calm at peace in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.490" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">yourself that in contrast to the part</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.150" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">that serve nervous and anxious</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:23.140" style="s2">and can you bring that into more</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:26.260" style="s2">awareness and nurture it with your</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.140" end="00:20:28.120" style="s2">attention if it&#39;s that you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.260" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">you&#39;re somehow wasting your time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.120" end="00:20:33.030" style="s2">meditation and there&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.380" end="00:20:33.030" style="s2">things you need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.850" end="00:20:42.370" style="s2">then but seriously reflect on maybe talk</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.780" end="00:20:45.549" style="s2">to somebody about the framing you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.370" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">about befriending yourself I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.549" end="00:20:51.460" style="s2">you and I don&#39;t want to be too intrusive</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:53.650" style="s2">but um I know I can fall prey to this as</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.460" end="00:21:00.039" style="s2">well so I&#39;m speaking with experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.650" end="00:21:01.750" style="s2">where I because especially the religious</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.039" end="00:21:04.929" style="s2">bringing I was brought up and I can</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.750" end="00:21:09.250" style="s2">confuse self-care with being selfish or</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.929" end="00:21:11.260" style="s2">I can consider right this kind of taking</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.250" end="00:21:13.030" style="s2">care of myself not really important</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.260" end="00:21:14.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s not producing anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.030" end="00:21:16.690" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re given all kinds of messages</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.980" end="00:21:18.610" style="s2">that conflict with what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.690" end="00:21:21.070" style="s2">and these are missed messages that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.610" end="00:21:23.380" style="s2">bound up with time but if you read for</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.070" end="00:21:25.570" style="s2">example Hans book on the scent of time</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.380" end="00:21:27.700" style="s2">our culture has basically eroded time</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.570" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">it&#39;s become he calls it it&#39;s autumn eyes</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.700" end="00:21:32.380" style="s2">and just buzzes and whiz and we have it</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the capacity to linger with</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.380" end="00:21:37.809" style="s2">things and therefore to be transformed</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.549" style="s2">by touching their depths so you might</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.809" end="00:21:41.770" style="s2">also want to take a look at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.549" end="00:21:45.309" style="s2">work that&#39;s being done on the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.770" end="00:21:46.750" style="s2">cognitive grammar surrounding time again</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.309" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the particulars and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.750" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">trying to answer many different</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:53.530" style="s2">possibilities at once and give you sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">of an overall integrated way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.530" end="00:22:01.090" style="s2">responding here the time timer will not</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">go off or fear of being lost and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.090" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">okay so the first one is like I said</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:09.159" style="s2">practice that that was another question</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:11.470" style="s2">from time one so practice just show over</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.159" end="00:22:13.330" style="s2">and over and I mean ad nauseam over and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.470" end="00:22:18.789" style="s2">over again the timer works it works it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.330" end="00:22:21.880" style="s2">works it works right and then a fear of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.789" end="00:22:24.429" style="s2">being lost and avoid have you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.880" end="00:22:26.230" style="s2">experienced the void</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.429" end="00:22:29.559" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m not I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.230" end="00:22:32.230" style="s2">facetious I mean what is your fear of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.559" end="00:22:35.710" style="s2">are you imagining something then</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.230" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">remember to not confuse your imagination</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.710" end="00:22:40.299" style="s2">of something with the thinking you step</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.740" style="s2">back and look at the imagery and feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.299" end="00:22:43.740" style="s2">how your body what your mind about</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.740" end="00:22:46.210" style="s2">you&#39;re doing a look at no imagining</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.740" end="00:22:47.299" style="s2">imagining and not doesn&#39;t matter that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.210" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">you&#39;re imagining the void</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.299" end="00:22:54.860" style="s2">you&#39;re imagining take a look at it oh if</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:57.649" style="s2">you&#39;ve had moments perhaps you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.860" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">practicing for a long time where that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.649" end="00:23:02.509" style="s2">narrative voice drops way and you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:04.759" style="s2">the silence yes that can initially be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.509" end="00:23:07.940" style="s2">startling and what you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.759" end="00:23:09.409" style="s2">trust it&#39;s a kind of faith here you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.940" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">to trust the traditions when they tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.409" end="00:23:16.669" style="s2">you that if you keep going that this</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:19.549" style="s2">goes it does an aspect shift it flips it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.669" end="00:23:21.619" style="s2">goes from being right to a realization</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.549" end="00:23:25.129" style="s2">of the opposite so try to taste through</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.619" end="00:23:27.499" style="s2">your day the fever hunger of that of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.129" end="00:23:29.809" style="s2">constantly feeding that self-referential</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.499" end="00:23:33.259" style="s2">talking might have just keep consuming</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.809" end="00:23:37.789" style="s2">words and stories it&#39;s our moral and</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.460" end="00:23:45.409" style="s2">but it&#39;s like when that fever hunger</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.950" end="00:23:49.460" style="s2">goes away this should go to&#39; but also</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.619" end="00:23:59.269" style="s2">right you&#39;ll get an aspect shift the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.489" end="00:24:02.539" style="s2">fundamental inversion now there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.539" end="00:24:07.779" style="s2">experienced trauma and this is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.659" end="00:24:12.169" style="s2">and the fear of the void is the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.779" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">that of a dissociation then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.169" end="00:24:17.359" style="s2">perhaps talk to somebody with</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.840" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">professional expertise about that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.359" end="00:24:23.299" style="s2">maybe slow down this practice until that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:25.639" style="s2">tendency towards dissociation is more</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.299" end="00:24:27.230" style="s2">properly therapeutically addressed I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.190" end="00:24:35.119" style="s2">speak out of what I know in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.600" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">experience of teaching in of other</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.119" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">people have done this but everybody also</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.070" end="00:24:44.029" style="s2">has their own idiosyncratic situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">and so I hope I helped Dimitar what does</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.029" end="00:24:47.659" style="s2">surrendering to the experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:50.690" style="s2">practically mean in terms you use in</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.659" end="00:24:52.190" style="s2">this course a lot vocal people</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.690" end="00:24:54.109" style="s2">emphasized the importance of surrender</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.190" end="00:24:55.519" style="s2">and psychedelic trip and it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.109" end="00:24:58.530" style="s2">like some kind of surrender is important</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.519" end="00:25:02.370" style="s2">in order to gain the systematic insight</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.530" end="00:25:11.400" style="s2">so for me I don&#39;t use the term surrender</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.370" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">a lot and that&#39;s that that&#39;s partially</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.400" end="00:25:19.020" style="s2">because of my own religious upbringing</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:22.260" style="s2">in the way it harmed me but also also do</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.020" end="00:25:25.860" style="s2">my ignorance of Islam which means of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.260" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">course to surrender but I I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.860" end="00:25:28.500" style="s2">much deeper understanding I think of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:32.190" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.500" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">especially from on Taoism and also from</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.190" end="00:25:36.780" style="s2">the Buddhist practices also from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">Neoplatonic tradition the way I</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:41.220" style="s2">understand it is and this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.710" style="s2">the cognitive science of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.220" end="00:25:45.390" style="s2">mode you need to be in in order to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.710" end="00:25:47.490" style="s2">an insight if you try to force it inside</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.390" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to have an insight you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.490" end="00:25:53.310" style="s2">won&#39;t have one in fact that very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">tight hard focus and grasping will</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.310" end="00:25:57.570" style="s2">thwart what you have to do is you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:26:00.510" style="s2">to let go of that you have to move out</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.570" end="00:26:03.380" style="s2">of modal confusion and to move into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.510" end="00:26:07.770" style="s2">being mode and then what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.380" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">we are trying to sensitize ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.770" end="00:26:12.450" style="s2">afford the fact that our minds are</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:17.970" style="s2">ultimately dynamically self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.450" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">and we are trying to let so we do all</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.970" end="00:26:23.070" style="s2">this plan it but we forget that all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.250" style="s2">our planning actually depends on our</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.070" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">moment-to-moment ability to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.250" end="00:26:30.990" style="s2">situations and dynamically self organize</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:33.240" style="s2">and adjust and then below the coping</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.990" end="00:26:35.010" style="s2">what grounds the coping is how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.240" end="00:26:37.650" style="s2">actually dynamically coupled to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:39.420" style="s2">world and how that can go go bad and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.650" end="00:26:41.070" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing or open up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.420" end="00:26:44.460" style="s2">reciprocal opening and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.070" end="00:26:46.440" style="s2">below the coupling is is that the kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.460" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">of conformity that that there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.440" end="00:26:51.330" style="s2">there are principles at work within that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:55.470" style="s2">are also at work without principles and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.330" end="00:26:59.550" style="s2">patterns and so surrendering means to</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.470" end="00:27:02.910" style="s2">stop trying to run the whole show from</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.550" end="00:27:05.670" style="s2">the planning mode to recognize and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.910" end="00:27:09.270" style="s2">accept that ok now is the time where I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.670" end="00:27:12.180" style="s2">cope and then below that the coping</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.270" end="00:27:14.700" style="s2">depends on now is a time in which I</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.180" end="00:27:18.060" style="s2">allow myself to be dynamically coupled</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.700" end="00:27:21.300" style="s2">to the world etc and so that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.060" end="00:27:24.620" style="s2">understand the surrendering in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.300" end="00:27:27.540" style="s2">process ultimately to acknowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.620" end="00:27:30.630" style="s2">recognize recognize acknowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.540" end="00:27:34.530" style="s2">recognize the fact that most of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.630" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">cognition is not ultimately in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.530" end="00:27:38.340" style="s2">planning although it gets a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:40.230" style="s2">attention because that planning depends</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.340" end="00:27:42.600" style="s2">on the coping which depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.230" end="00:27:45.510" style="s2">coupling which ultimately depends on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.600" end="00:27:47.310" style="s2">deep kind of ontological conformity and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.510" end="00:27:51.930" style="s2">the surrendering is a deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.310" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">acknowledge a lived enacted recognition</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.930" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">of that I hope that was a hopeful answer</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:01.680" style="s2">here a hi Kara here Crowther I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.210" style="s2">relisting to the routing list and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.680" end="00:28:05.130" style="s2">noticed it&#39;s much easier to do reading</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.210" end="00:28:07.320" style="s2">what really what I&#39;m listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.130" end="00:28:08.700" style="s2">going through it that&#39;s helped me notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.320" end="00:28:10.530" style="s2">that my inner coach doesn&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.700" end="00:28:12.300" style="s2">authority and so monkey mind comes up</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.530" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">big time how can I increase the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.300" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">authority without being punishing you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">have to cultivate you Buddha you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:23.430" style="s2">celebrate it more you have to note keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:26.580" style="s2">a journal in the moments and this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.430" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">self aggrandizing and right and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.580" end="00:28:33.000" style="s2">course that&#39;s why all the hero myths are</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:35.010" style="s2">paired with hubris myths but right you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.000" end="00:28:37.830" style="s2">can there&#39;s there there&#39;s vices of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.010" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">excess and there&#39;s vices of deficit as</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.830" end="00:28:42.800" style="s2">Aristotle would say you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">you need help with literally</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.800" end="00:28:49.050" style="s2">encouragement so you need to more</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.110" end="00:28:51.240" style="s2">actively water your Buddhas celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.050" end="00:28:54.390" style="s2">your Buddha perhaps read more stories of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.240" end="00:28:57.150" style="s2">the historical Buddha right try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.390" end="00:28:58.140" style="s2">notice moon or what I saw I sort I</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.150" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">apologize there shouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:06.120" style="s2">perhaps your inner sage is Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.570" end="00:29:07.920" style="s2">perhaps your Taoist and right it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.120" end="00:29:10.470" style="s2">loud say I don&#39;t want to be presumptuous</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.920" end="00:29:13.290" style="s2">but that&#39;s what I mean by the inner</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.470" end="00:29:18.630" style="s2">Buddha right and so if you&#39;re that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:05.669" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">is to be a teacher that awakens within</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:20.429" style="s2">when I meditate no sorry Matthew</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.179" end="00:30:27.659" style="s2">practices shouldn&#39;t be done for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.649" end="00:30:29.700" style="s2">such as special powers gaining more</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.659" end="00:30:31.799" style="s2">power in the world being content getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.700" end="00:30:33.659" style="s2">rid of negative and all emotions like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.799" end="00:30:35.460" style="s2">stone Buddha or making us feel unique</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.659" end="00:30:37.289" style="s2">and special what is right motivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.460" end="00:30:40.260" style="s2">viable for why we personally need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.289" end="00:30:44.279" style="s2">transform our awakening using these</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.260" end="00:30:54.330" style="s2">practices yeah so the right motivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.279" end="00:30:57.929" style="s2">is right motivation well what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">say I&#39;m afraid of it being misheard or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.929" end="00:31:01.799" style="s2">miss framed as a special power the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">motivation is the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.799" end="00:31:07.710" style="s2">which is the Buddhist said you know no</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:12.000" style="s2">matter where you put your cup in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.710" end="00:31:15.029" style="s2">ocean it has the same taste right salt</p>
