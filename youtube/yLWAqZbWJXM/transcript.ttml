<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.529" style="s2">just getting started here I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.890" end="00:00:16.170" style="s2">an introduction and kind of get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.529" end="00:00:22.710" style="s2">on just what is Magellan course by way</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.170" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">of an overall introduction and I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">that for some of us we&#39;ve been in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:31.830" style="s2">now for about twelve weeks but we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.560" end="00:00:35.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t really talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">directly so when I think about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.640" end="00:00:39.210" style="s2">question what is the Magellan course</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:41.850" style="s2">what is the project</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.210" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">what is this voyage we&#39;ve embarked on</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">the first thing I think of is that first</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">and foremost it&#39;s an experiment and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">experiment is ongoing and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">co-created by those who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">participating at many different levels</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">in many different scales if I ask myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">what kind of experiment is it I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">say perhaps to give it a color or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:23.670" style="s2">flavor I would say it&#39;s an experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">what we might call post post modernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.670" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">or post post modern ways so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">something new and emerging post post</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">modern ways of what we might say post</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">post modern ways of thinking post post</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">modern ways of being and this could also</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">mean being together not just an</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">individual aspect post post modern ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:10.429" style="s2">because this is a course of learning and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:10.429" style="s2">we talked about the learning circle and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.790" end="00:02:20.519" style="s2">co-creating new and emerging type</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:23.400" style="s2">learning so I think that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.519" end="00:02:26.870" style="s2">start but I think that for me the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:32.459" style="s2">experiment really has a different</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.870" end="00:02:34.980" style="s2">frontier because I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.459" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">being done in many different forms and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.980" end="00:02:40.519" style="s2">so the frontier aspect of it I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">and this is what gives the Magellan</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.519" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">voyage makes it a metaphor for us</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">because Magellan went into unknown</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:52.859" style="s2">territories and that is it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:03:04.769" style="s2">experiment in not only post-postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.859" end="00:03:07.919" style="s2">but a post dialectic engagement and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.769" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">I mean by that the possibility of a post</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.919" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">dialectic reasoning the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">post dialectic language the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">of post dialectic modes of inquiry the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:38.549" style="s2">possibility of post dialectic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:43.909" style="s2">and these are not only a frontier but</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.549" end="00:03:53.629" style="s2">these are all have to be innovations</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.909" end="00:03:53.629" style="s2">they have to be designed and co-created</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.530" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I would say is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:04.730" style="s2">frontier aspect of the magellan course</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">but I think that in addition to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.730" end="00:04:17.549" style="s2">there&#39;s even another trajectory that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">envision and that trajectory has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.549" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">with this notion of a process ontology</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.980" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">and the idea of an until logics and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">these I think are really something</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">totally brand-new and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:05:04.170" style="s2">working hypothesis so in subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:09.230" style="s2">videos I would like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.170" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">exactly this what kind of experiments</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.230" end="00:05:17.960" style="s2">leads it&#39;s post-postmodern ways that may</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">be already emerging and how do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">impacts ways of thinking being and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">learning and these are things that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:30.419" style="s2">might be seeing elsewhere and then to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:33.720" style="s2">look at this boundary this edge or this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.419" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">frontier that the magellan course is</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.720" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">hoping to cross and what could it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:47.340" style="s2">possibly mean to have a host dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:50.790" style="s2">or a trans rational kind of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.340" end="00:05:52.740" style="s2">and how that would look like in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.790" end="00:05:55.200" style="s2">the way we reason what types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.740" end="00:05:58.140" style="s2">languages are needed what types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.200" end="00:06:00.930" style="s2">enquiries need to be designed and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.140" end="00:06:07.860" style="s2">types of discourse need to be co-created</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.930" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">so this could be a first video this area</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.860" end="00:06:11.350" style="s2">could be a second video</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:13.930" style="s2">with the different subsets gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.350" end="00:06:16.690" style="s2">more complicated and then lastly this</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.930" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">whole notion of this trajectory where we</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.690" end="00:06:23.050" style="s2">are going in terms of a process ontology</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">that would inform for example our</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.050" end="00:06:30.000" style="s2">cosmology the really big ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.070" end="00:06:41.500" style="s2">spirituality and how we make meaning for</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.530" end="00:06:45.880" style="s2">example would be one of these big ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.500" end="00:06:49.180" style="s2">and then whether this notion of aanchal</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.880" end="00:06:52.900" style="s2">objects can be facilitated and developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.180" end="00:06:56.320" style="s2">and actually taught so to me that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.900" end="00:06:59.560" style="s2">the magellan course is all about both as</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.320" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">it arises today and looking at its</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.560" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">frontiers and its trajectory</p>
