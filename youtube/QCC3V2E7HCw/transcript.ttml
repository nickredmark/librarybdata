<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">very much like a lot of what i saw</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">that led to a long</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">insurgency um</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">an insurgency that wasn&#39;t made up of a</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">that mirrored the nation state in terms</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">it organized itself with the political</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">wing and economic wing et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">this insurgency was made up of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">dozens of different groups in the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">of iraq it was 70 different groups and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.759" style="s2">they all</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">seemed to be able to work together in</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">fight the united states and the iraqi</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">and they uh did this using an open</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">source dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">um it made it really tough to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">eliminate so when the counter insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">you know found a low-level member of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">typically that would result in flipping</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">them and then going up the chain of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">command up the pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">until you hit the planting cell and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">you&#39;d wipe them out and the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">would collapse</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">in this case they&#39;d go up a level maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:58.560" style="s2">two and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">group would evaporate could be gone that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.560" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">was the extent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">the group&#39;s depth um and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">there were 69 other groups to take their</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">place and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">another group would emerge almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">instantaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">and the way they operated together was</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">through uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">kind of an open source innovation</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">tinkering approach</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">uh instead of a master strategy or</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">master plan coming down from on high</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">they tinkered at the low levels and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">tried things out and whatever stuck</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">against the wall you know you throw</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">works and then every if that works uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">everybody copies it</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">it was like a chemical trail being left</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">and the press would then be the chemical</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.600" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">open source insurgencies became open</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:30.720" style="s2">eventually in egypt and and led to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">civil war in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.720" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">syria uh open source protests don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:43.919" style="s2">i got going</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">they grew very very rapidly and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.919" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">were impossible to shut down um</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">and uh most recently in the states we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">saw them in the uh the election</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">uh in in 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">uh just before that we had occupy and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">had the tea party movement both open</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">source movements</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">um mostly in reaction to the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">uh and that led to uh something a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">formal uh you know an open source</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">insurgency that that took over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">republican party</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">and used trump as a weapon to take over</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">the white house um</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">so uh that kind of set us up into the</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">i approached the whole thing as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">of a breakdown of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:28.880" style="s2">you know my way into this was uh through</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.880" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">breakdown of the nation state kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.759" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">um they weren&#39;t able to deliver the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">political goods and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">groups would arise within the nation</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">dominance and they would use these</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">methods to to take it on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">so you know open source insurgencies fit</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">within that framework for me it was my</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">way in is</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">it it proved that it was capable of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">taking down</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">states directly through external force</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">uh taking down even a governor in puerto</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">lost to an open source protest</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">and then also taking over the government</p>

<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">and then as i got into the topic and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.519" style="s2">started the global uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">rulers report i started finding other</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">um two other ones uh in particular uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">one was uh the mcluhan perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">that social technology kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">social technology i helped build back in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:17.760" style="s2">2001 that became social networking</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">uh had rewired our brands</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.760" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">and um we think differently than we used</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.600" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">uh very similar to what happened back in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.600" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">with the printing press when the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">printing press hit</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">it rewired us uh it made</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">for instance in in terms of religion it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">made bibles accessible</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">i mean even priests and in the 1500s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a full bible</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">i mean they had excerpts and they only</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">tiny portions of it it was all uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">largely taught by uh through an oral</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">so um that rewiring that</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">that that went on in with the printing</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">press was occurring now</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">with us and online and it was changing</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">the way we were thinking and because it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:06.000" style="s2">was changing the way we were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">it would change the way we organized</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.000" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">socially</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">as kind of an after effect and some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">the ways it changed us</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">is that we started to think it less as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">kind of you read something in its</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.079" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">entirety</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">uh and you know in isolation</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">as an individual inform your opinions</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">through that reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">the kind of long-form approach to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">kind of short</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">staccato rhythm of lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">too much information the process is</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">flowing over you and what you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">is you just pick the pieces out of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">that makes sense and they you can fit</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">into a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">that you are curating um that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">pattern making that pattern matching is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">constant now i mean we are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">pattern matching</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">we can&#39;t handle the flow of information</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">that&#39;s coming over us</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">and the social consequences of that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">pattern matching turns into kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">pattern curation it becomes a shared</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">that millions of people are are curating</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">forms the basis of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">um a third one is they came out of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">uh david roenfeld&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">uh timid analysis uh tribes institutions</p>

<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">we are on the verge of a new social</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:32.800" style="s2">decision making system</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">which is a kind of a positive way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.800" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">look at it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:40.560" style="s2">that this network piece could become a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">something to rival the existing</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.560" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">decision-making systems that got us out</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">of the the middle ages things like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">tribes</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">tribes became nationalism uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">institutions you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">basic bureaucracy became the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">powerhouse behind science behind</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">technology behind corporate structures</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">behind government</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">and that markets stitched it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">together graded information finding you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">know graded</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:08.959" style="s2">allocation of resources those three</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">started off very rough and they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:15.680" style="s2">refined over time to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">largely beneficial because we&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.680" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">on a macro level we&#39;re certainly a hell</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">of a lot better off now than we were 500</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">um so uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">what do networks add and and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:29.920" style="s2">with the new</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">social decision making system is that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.920" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.519" style="s2">it&#39;s really rough and it can be abused</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">and it could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.519" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">emerging malformed and cause all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">of problems um</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">i mean think of the kind of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">case scenario with bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">bureaucracy is great</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">at mobilizing resources and getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">things done at scale</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have any moral compass</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just a set of procedures that work</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">in a in a hierarchy with with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">many many people following uh wrote</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">descript job descriptions and and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">orders that come down from on high</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:09.959" style="s2">um and the abuse of that ended up in say</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">concentration camps or ended up in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.959" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">totalitarianism of communism where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">had a single bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">running everything um</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">and you know the same thing would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">with markets i mean early markets were</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">definitely very</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">brutal in terms of how unequal the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">income distribution</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">and the wealth distribution</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">was so you&#39;d starve even though the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">market was free</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.199" style="s2">um so network decision making what is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.199" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">well we got a little taste of it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">you know piece it together as i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">along but it was this</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">it operates differently than the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s to a certain extent more</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">powerful than the other three</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">uh it works on a dynamic between</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">consensus and descent</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">a functional network decision making</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">system consensus is that we all agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">to do something and if it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">correctly that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">that something is very narrow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">situation specific and it lasts</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">for a short period of time until that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">task is done or to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">goal is achieved um we got that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">initially with</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">the coven response uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">we all pretty much agreed that we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">to stop it from taking root in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">united states</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">um and that we took a lot of action as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">individuals that slowed it down we</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">pretty much used that network consensus</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">to shut down the country to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">move to work from home to uh reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">ourselves in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">that muted the response well before the</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">the the state the bureaucracy actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">made the decision to do anything and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">that was all done with an absence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">information even though the fda</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">cdc screwed up and didn&#39;t get any tests</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">produced i mean we had no feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">through all of february and into late</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">march</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">uh because we did at beginning march we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">only had 300 tests</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">a day in a nation of 330 million because</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">of that screw-up</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:13.680" style="s2">and even that didn&#39;t stop the network</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">from responding effectively</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.680" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">not effective enough but it shows the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">power of the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">and the descent and the other part is</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">the descent the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">the set will actually constantly pick</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">away at the consensus and make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">persist beyond its shelf life you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">uh or that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">exceed its reach and we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">with the covered response</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">consensus flailed at actually solving</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">the problem the descent grew and grew</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">and grew and it continues to grow</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">um the dissent prevents the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">from locking things in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">and that you know that&#39;s a functional</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:57.040" style="s2">decision-making system and refinement</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.040" end="00:16:00.320" style="s2">maybe over decades maybe over a century</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">we could get that thing working in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.320" end="00:16:04.480" style="s2">in a way that actually yields some</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">benefit i mean just the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.480" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">combine markets with bureaucracy that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">use the markup system to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">to elect leaders that ran bureaucracies</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">through you know elections</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">that kind of combination that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">cross fertilization could be beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">the problem is is that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">when it is dysfunctional that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">consensus</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">can lock everything in it can lock</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">everything down</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">into a single cohesive view um</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">and and it could be so total</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.920" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">and it&#39;s using network technologies</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">using interconnections</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">um the way we run our economy way we run</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">our society that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">will prevent anything else from</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">the opposite being true is that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">descent could win and we end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">in just perpetual chaos um</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">my fear is more the total lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">and and if you look internationally you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">could say maybe china is more the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">consensus consensus-driven</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">approach they&#39;re moving towards a total</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">lockdown for</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">in order to make themselves more capable</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">of handling the expresses of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">globalized environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">um but at a massive reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">freedom of movement and innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.079" style="s2">then the descent</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">side would be more like russia where</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.079" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">everything is just chaotic constantly</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">and the only people that benefit is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.760" style="s2">the the core of interlocked</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">uh corrupt companies that are at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.760" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">center of things</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">um network tribes emerge out of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">out of the consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.760" end="00:17:45.200" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re seeing now is is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.200" end="00:17:51.520" style="s2">uh through pattern matching has built up</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:53.520" style="s2">tribes that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.520" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">dominate the conversation they&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.520" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">to the streets and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:18:02.480" style="s2">rolling up uh political power</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">and the fear is that over time</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">maybe even just a year or two that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">could end up in a consensus lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">into a tribal lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">because these tribes aren&#39;t just a you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">know an opinion they</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">start to become cohesive social units</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">due to the dynamics of tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">tribalism works really really well</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">online and even mcluhan would say that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">we could when we became global villagers</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.760" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve re-tribalized we&#39;ve you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">global village always was seemed so</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">hopeful is that we&#39;re all together</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually global villagers are</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">backbiters they&#39;re constantly monitoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">each other&#39;s behavior they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">in each other&#39;s business and they kill</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:44.559" style="s2">outsiders they kill people who deviate</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">i mean some of the worst things happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.559" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">of course at the tribal level</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.160" style="s2">at the village level when somebody does</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.160" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">conform so um that kind of gives you a</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">people that are watching this on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">youtube channel um something that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">your edge of your thinking ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">you would like to stress test</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">throughout these four weeks at this</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">series that we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">um at the very edge</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">well there&#39;s a you know a big</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">debate in my head in terms of how this</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">conflict rolls out</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">right and so i&#39;m working through that um</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">and what that means for the us uh coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.799" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">up through the election and after this</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.440" style="s2">the election is it&#39;s both more important</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:02.000" style="s2">and less important than many people</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.440" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.000" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">that this tribal conflict is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">dominant underneath the scenes and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">uh i have some thinking that i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">been doing in terms of you know it kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">of reforms or</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">or tweaks to the system that we could</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">make that that would give us a path out</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">and that not only out of this but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">would set in motion</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">a a a set of changes in a set of uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">uh social dynamics that that would</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">you know improve our lives over the long</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:39.520" style="s2">term and that has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">data ownership and thinking in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.520" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">data ownership and kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">creating a version of that online that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">that moves your interests forwards but</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">you can&#39;t get that without ownership</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of questions about</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">that maybe that would be the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:59.760" style="s2">right and um so the question i had is uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:01.440" style="s2">kind of the current players in this sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">of culture 2.0 or there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">there&#39;s just tribal warfare that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">like antifa um black lives matter uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">q anon you have any thoughts on how that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">is playing out with the current election</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">yeah um well the the tribes and this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">interesting um typically in the past</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">tribalism um was driven forward by a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">you know a positive narrative a positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:29.039" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">this is why you know a story that says</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.039" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">this is why we are better together</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">uh this is why you are special this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">why you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">we uh should stick together</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">and this is all here are all the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done together in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">overcome adversity tribes in the online</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">um don&#39;t form based on this positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">they form on based on a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">that describes their enemies a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">of behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">is descriptive of what they oppose</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">so um that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">becomes the basis of fictive kinship</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">fictive kinship is a way to extend uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">your connection to people beyond uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">actual blood relationship it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">basis of nationalism it&#39;s the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">of of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">any kind of large-scale group cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">and thing is you need that victim</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:31.919" style="s2">kinship in order to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">make things work because without that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.919" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">fictitionship there&#39;s a chance</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">and and it becomes almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">self-fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">is that um you won&#39;t trust or people</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">won&#39;t trust what other people are saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">because they don&#39;t think that they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">connected they&#39;re not kin</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:50.640" style="s2">in any even a loose sense that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">they say is false</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">even the most basic fact even the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">basic observation that they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">uh is seen as something malicious and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">at that stage now as the nationalism our</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">former form</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">of victim kitchen dissolves is weakened</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">as we punch holes in it we&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">trusting of everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">uh we don&#39;t even attract we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">agree on the basic facts because we</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">don&#39;t trust that the other person</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">presenting those facts</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">those observations are being truthful so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">in the case of online tribes um these</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">negative patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">uh are curated by millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">and they go out and they find examples</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:35.840" style="s2">and that if they can find a video of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">or or something that has some</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">kind of empathic content they post it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">and then everyone goes i knew it</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">that&#39;s example what this pattern means</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">or you know this is everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">um the big patterns i&#39;ve seen right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">i put those in my most recent reports</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">you have the anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">the anti-fascists you have on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">right tribes you have more the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">anti-terrorists</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">uh the anti-anti-americans which are</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">basically the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.960" style="s2">you know anti-traitors right um and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">there are a lot of other little minor</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.960" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">tribes that are less effective</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">below that um so far the left tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.799" style="s2">stronger</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">i mean granted they have more of a of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.799" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">driver they see trump in the white house</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">and he poses</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">they&#39;ve been cast as an existential</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">threat and that has driven tribe growth</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">the right tribes are have been slower to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">form um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">largely because they you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">trump in the white house which serves</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">kind of as a bullwork as long as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">kind of like the canary in the coal mine</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a as long as he&#39;s still in</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">the existential threat from what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">on in portland and other places doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">seem as dire</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:51.279" style="s2">um then once he&#39;s removed that could</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">change and also</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.279" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">trump is not sticking to the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">he jumps around and that jumping around</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">means he&#39;s not you know helping</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">the tribes form at all he throws out</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">things every once in a while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.679" style="s2">tribal specific and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">like for instance when he sent the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.679" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">security forces security detail to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">portland</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">that was to try to get this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">anti-terrorist</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">you know anti-anarchist kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">tribal movement going it wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">that effective because people didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">them as</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">existential threats to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:31.760" style="s2">necessary to get that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">rolling um but there may be some</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">mechanisms that he may be able to play</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">to do that but i in general he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">helping the tribalization on the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">yeah i could keep on going you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">switch a question or</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">yeah um okay i&#39;ll just sneak in one</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">follow-up question because it was really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">uh because i agree that the my read on</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">culture 2.0 is that people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">the tribes on the right are more</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">than the tribes on the on the left which</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">makes them less i guess potent or</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">um with one exception that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">rising is the q anon</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">tribe um could you speak a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">on that i think q anon for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">is i mean they&#39;re driven by pattern</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">matching right</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">and they uh uh a pattern of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">that&#39;s arrayed against them</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">right and that they are a malformed</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">tribe of the right largely but they can</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">cross uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s because the right tribalism hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:34.640" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.600" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">flourished hasn&#39;t really taken off</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.640" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">uh and people would say oh yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">trump&#39;s in office but</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s really he&#39;s he&#39;s not leading a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">tribe per se he led an insurgency the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">open source insurgency to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">into power he he&#39;s more of a weapon they</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">placed in power to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">kind of a grenade that constantly goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">off and disrupts things</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">but he&#39;s not a tribal leader</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">in that regard so q anon is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">you know formed out of itself i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">would be eaten up</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">once the the tribes on the right start</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">to form</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;ll just be absorbed right in it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2">disappear</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">right now it is it&#39;s just out there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it shows the power of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">pattern matching and how</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">you know identifying with it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">constantly adding to it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">growing a pattern can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">powerful it makes helps people make</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">sense it helps people</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">deal with the overload of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">and the chaos around them</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">cool let&#39;s let&#39;s switch to some uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:41.039" style="s2">questions in the chat uh benita</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">roy you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.039" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">if you can unmute yourself um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">um so i actually have two questions that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">kind of like wrapped in one question</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">so um maybe you can help me suss it out</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">and that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">uh what kind of recommendations can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">make or that people are making to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">change the way the algorithms on social</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">either contribute to a functional</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">uh kind of decision making</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">or uh detract or obstruct that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">um it seems to me that we&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">social media that has doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">incentivized to have a functional</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">network intelligence right and yet still</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">some of these some of these effects so</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">how consciously could we</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">uh what it so just to come on that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">uh what what tags along with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">because you guys were talking about q</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">and on</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">is if the level of pattern recognition</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">that is creating</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">tribes is of such low bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">isn&#39;t that a potential threat for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">ai to capitalize on creating the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:57.840" style="s2">illusion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">of pattern inside some of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.840" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">and kind of kind of igniting and flaring</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.279" style="s2">up tribes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">not really coming from a human-centric</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">or human response</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">so i just have questions on that level i</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">hope that somehow they make sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">know it makes a lot of sense um</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">okay from a mcluhan perspective okay he</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">he said that uh in order for us to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:24.080" style="s2">survive</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">what we&#39;re going through right now we</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.080" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">may eventually need to uh</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">all right there&#39;s kind of a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.760" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">offhand comment that he made but it made</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">a lot of sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">that something that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">mediate</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">the conversation in a way that turns it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">positive just like we you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">you know harness bureaucracies and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">put place rules for them</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">put in place rules for markets and how</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">that works but to do this on a network</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">scale you actually have to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">can handle you know billions of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">interactions and billions of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">and that can only be done through ai</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">and if you look at it from that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">perspective a lot of what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">the battle</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">between the tribes is over who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">how that technological artifact is built</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">who gets to set what is trained against</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">what is trying to optimize and</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">it that that means it&#39;s kind of a battle</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">for the future right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">so if one tribe dominates and it can</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">dictate and force uh all the big</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">social networks and the technology</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.600" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">companies to come after that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">into alignment and that they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">constantly seeking out</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">behaviors that they find objectionable</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">or an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:47.679" style="s2">uh whether it&#39;s other tribes on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:49.440" style="s2">right or tribes on the left then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.679" end="00:30:50.880" style="s2">lock down time and and that we get</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.440" end="00:30:54.640" style="s2">locked in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.880" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">using this technology into a single</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.640" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">way of of thinking a single approach to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s opaque and it&#39;s hidden and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:05.679" style="s2">not something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">you can you can avoid because it&#39;s baked</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.679" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">into all the technology platforms</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">and ai will be into you know every</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">single product that we touch</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">within the next 10 to 20 years every</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">single one</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s in all the services that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:20.799" style="s2">touch so that&#39;s kind of the great</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:21.919" style="s2">lockdown that&#39;s what i call the lock the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">long night</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.919" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">you know one of the mechanisms for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">long night is that once that locks down</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">and then once you see it propagated</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">across you know countries</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">is that you just get this narrower</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">orthodoxy that doesn&#39;t innovate</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change uh or people keeping</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:41.279" style="s2">their heads down</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">for fear of ever crossing into</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.279" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">into the territory that would eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">their jobs and eliminate their future</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">um i don&#39;t see how you get rid of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">at that point</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s so pervasive and uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">like a civilization killer</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">it&#39;s end game so um</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">that asks you a question i mean it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">yeah i think i answered it yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">makes me realize like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">persistent confusion</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">like we&#39;re all there&#39;s all this like war</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">but you there&#39;s this there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.240" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">that i&#39;m hearing from you and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">it&#39;s really a thought that i have is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">that our persistent need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">make the whole ecology information</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">ecology makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">pushes us toward wanting this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">lockdown you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">right and i think the challenge is so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">because there are all these people</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">figure out cracked enough make sense out</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">of this and i think what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">we have to uh shift our way of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">a much broader information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">where the dissenting and the noise is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">part of the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s this other need this hangover</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.679" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">now that we see all of it to want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">lock it down and make sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">is the danger and this is like what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:18.640" style="s2">been trying to say about all these other</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">war on sense making uh factions is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">that whole impulse is in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">of the threat you&#39;re naming</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">right yeah and uh that a functional</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">using network decision making it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">network social decision making system</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">has consensus and descent right it has</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:35.840" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got to have that descent in</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">order to make sure that the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.840" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kill us</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:42.000" style="s2">yeah and it works like the brain this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:45.039" style="s2">why you can go in and see competing</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.000" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">competing uh uh intentions all the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.039" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">because some are a sub</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">threshold because if the intention you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">have starts to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">not evolutionarily contextual anymore</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">then the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">other one comes and so this is i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">a message that i you know i&#39;m very happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">to hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">you know you know this needs to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">be made because the same people that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">are making this mistake right they just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">wanted to be locked down in</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">their direction correct that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">yep thank you hey you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">cool uh michael underwood you had a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">questions um</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">feel free to pick which one uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">most alive right now for you</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:41.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna mute yourself michael</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">oh yeah i don&#39;t think i have a well</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:46.560" style="s2">prepared enough question so i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">pass</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.560" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">um i&#39;ll just add that i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">the if you look at you reframe the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">problem a bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">around truth and you have this consensus</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">in the mainstream media and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">insurgency in the net various tribes you</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">know you could consider</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">a popular streamer to be his own network</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">tribe and they can be co-opted and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:14.480" style="s2">directed wherever you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">but uh that&#39;s the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.480" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">versus these tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s the narrative is like a football</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">and directionally um i think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">so like for example q anon some of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">predictions are directly more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">than cnn</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">and i just think that&#39;s interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:34.160" style="s2">terms of we were told that</p>

<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">it didn&#39;t happen so i think that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">of the interesting thing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">there used to be three news agencies</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">that could really trick the population</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">now the population has more of a chance</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">to</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">screwed up i mean particularly in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">united states more so than almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">everywhere else</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">of actually being solved i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">17 years of saying that in afghanistan</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">and that it would be universally good</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">for all of us if if we just let it go</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">um when you know you had al gore in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2">you know in front of congress saying you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">know hey we should</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">get them into the wto and open things up</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">and then here we are a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">totally unmanaged relationship and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">know china&#39;s accelerated</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">global warming even if you may not or</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">may or may not agree with that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">accelerated global warming by 20 to 30</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">through its uh pollution-heavy</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">uh industrial expansion</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">and exactly the opposite of what gore</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">was intending but it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">it shows that kind of screw up um and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">that uh now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:56.560" style="s2">peer competitor a technological peer</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">competitor that&#39;s that&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.560" end="00:38:00.800" style="s2">increasingly tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s got a tyrant&#39;s got a guy who</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.800" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">says he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">president for life so um and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">lock that you know they&#39;re locking down</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">their society</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">and then you have the financial crisis</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">which i think really you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">really stuck got got this whole ball</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">moving is that you have a crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">cost about 22</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.200" style="s2">23 trillion dollars in in economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">damage um</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.200" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">and if you dug into it and you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">watching that at the time it was just</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">fraud as high as a mountain of fraud and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">people selling direct to pension</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">funds i mean it was just everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">having their way with the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">and nobody</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">was held accountable for it none of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">no no none of the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">who brought this on us uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">were sent to jail from</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">i mean it was intentional</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">you know hiding of what had actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.359" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">gone on and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">and burying it uh you know after the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">fact and saying well you know we all</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">you know blood on our hands let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">let&#39;s not look at this</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">and that caused the tea party and occupy</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">to go it kicked them off</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.839" style="s2">and that brought open source to you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">movements into the united states</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.839" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">and those morphed over time and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">become tribes</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">since then so uh you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">dysfunction of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">you know that blue church that liberal</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">establishment of the existing decision</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">making systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s their inability to get things done</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">and done in an effective way</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">i mean even the current crovid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">you know with the fda</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">giving the cdc monopoly production</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">rights over the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">the uh the testing and then they flubbed</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">and then the slow release of power to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">the rest of the public health labs</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">to ramp up production and that put us</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">behind</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">by about a month and a half and that was</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">i mean almost all the casualties the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">has suffered um</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.280" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">you know the high rates were all in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">those early days because we didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">have a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have any mechanism to you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">to screen people or respond</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">because there was no way of knowing who</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">was sick</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">300 tests a day in march one that&#39;s nuts</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely nuts but again</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">and i can understand the thinking of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">know the fda to do that i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">was doing it because it was emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.440" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">quality over quantity it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">recognizing that the imminence of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">threat but</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">nonetheless again bureaucratic failure</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">bureaucratic decision making failure</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">and then the coverage afterwards by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">media is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:36.839" style="s2">they&#39;re not even focusing on what really</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">went wrong they&#39;re focused on other</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.839" end="00:40:42.079" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">so um yeah i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a decision</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.079" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">failure across the board</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">boy there&#39;s a lot of questions it seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">like i&#39;ve been watching this chat go</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">very effective at</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">forcing people into certain ways of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.560" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">thinking and not allowing people to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">deviate</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:13.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in some parts of the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">religions are still very good at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.040" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">the question is in the united states do</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">you think it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.720" style="s2">for any mainstream religion outside</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">let&#39;s say uh mormonism that still has a</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.720" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">pretty good lock on people</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">to reassert itself as being the primary</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:31.599" style="s2">source of truth in the network age</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:32.720" style="s2">yeah um there are a lot of religious</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.599" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">aspects to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.720" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">the tribalism we see um</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">there is you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">you could describe a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:44.480" style="s2">tribalism on the left is is very</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">puritanical</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.480" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">uh and that is uh it fights</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">using a moral warfare very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">uh religions fight um</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">and that that that&#39;s definitely playing</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">a part i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">you know religion is to a large extent</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">you know a tribal decision-making system</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">um it&#39;s the guardian of the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">moral infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">kind of the ethical infrastructure the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">key of you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">who we are um and that we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">subsumed by</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">tribes i mean you know that happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">with the printing press is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">i mean you know when martin luther</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">challenged the catholic church he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">alone in that there have been plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">challenges doing the exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.359" style="s2">thing that he did</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">except that when he you know nailed his</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.359" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">theses of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">on the uh on the door uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:38.720" style="s2">of the cathedral that was ripped off and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">then went out to printing presses and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.720" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">a hundred copies came back and then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">pamphlets</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:47.119" style="s2">and uh dissenting voices appeared</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.119" end="00:42:50.640" style="s2">vernacular bibles appeared everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.640" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">fragmented that universal church so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">there is a kind of a thing going on here</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">with with a network decision making</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s similar</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting who</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">whoever takes up the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">kind of moral warfare banner and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">uh in network tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:18.880" style="s2">is kind of a replacement for uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">a lot of what the traditional religions</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.880" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">have done in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">you know creating an orthodoxy and</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">creating a view of the world that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">coheres people</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:38.720" style="s2">so i don&#39;t really have a full answer on</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">what happens to the traditional churches</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">i do see that mainstream protestantism</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">has been under</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">undergoing a you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">kind of universal collapse um and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">there are some churches that have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">relatively effective at retaining their</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">flocks but uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.119" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see very soon how well</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">they can</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.119" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">move into the online world into the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:05.599" style="s2">network world and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">if they can&#39;t it&#39;ll be tough</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.599" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">for them</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">brian do you have a follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">yeah i was just wondering about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">catholic church as a microcosm of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">big question</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.640" style="s2">where we see some people in the catholic</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">church like let&#39;s say if you read ann</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.640" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">barnhart</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:25.359" style="s2">who is very traditionalist hardline</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:26.079" style="s2">saying the current pope is not the real</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">pope</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.079" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">uh the real pope is still the previous</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">pope and very dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">zealous uh and in promulgating a view</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.160" style="s2">catholicism that is very specific</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">and very here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.160" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">behave in the way we think of old tribes</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">and then you have most catholics that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">are not like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">and it may be that in catholicism we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">the fight between the small we retain</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">the real truth fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:58.720" style="s2">the modernization like where uh the pope</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">the current official pope is far more</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.720" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">liberal than catholics in the past</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">and so i&#39;m curious john if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">opinion about what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">catholic church in particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">um in general</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:15.440" style="s2">i think it&#39;s much harder to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">maintain cohesion based on something</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.440" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">you&#39;re for</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">in this environment something you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">a shared ideology or a shared uh view of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">the world and that applies to religion</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s so easy to pick apart and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">so easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">uh to snipe at and it caught is a source</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:33.680" style="s2">of so much</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">disagreement and there&#39;s a reason all</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.680" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">the tribes don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t uh held together by</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">a shared doctrine or a shared uh view of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">in sense of what they&#39;re for because uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">for instance say you&#39;re in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">justice well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">no one can agree on what justice</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">actually means somebody says this is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">good example and everybody else would</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">say wait wait that&#39;s not the example</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">this is the example this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2">networking kind of fragments that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">but they can&#39;t agree on what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">against um</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">so maybe that&#39;s the way out for the for</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">for traditional churches is to focus</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:16.800" style="s2">less on what they&#39;re for more about what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">they&#39;re against</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.800" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">and building up cohesion from there</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">tyler you had a question about the long</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">night i copied and pasted it below for</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:29.760" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">you can admit yourself and read it to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.760" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">john</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">oh great thanks i was just scrolling up</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">to get it um so in regards to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">potentially countering the long night um</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">would it be possible uh in principle to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">build something that functions</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">as the inverse of the social credit</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">system uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">instead of centralized coercion and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">group think from above</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:53.040" style="s2">like in china uh something that could</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">potentially be decentralized support for</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.040" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">individualism from below</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">i think that the first thing you got to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:06.160" style="s2">do is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">slow down the pressure to censor</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.160" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">that you know our current moves is you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">know censor everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">spouting nonsense or anything that they</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.599" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">you raise the amount of chaos that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">there but you</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:04.800" style="s2">preserve that descends function</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s really a question of how do you</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">open sourced it and made it possible for</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">the world to kind of do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">got the new york times to sign on uh to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">using</p>
