<p begin="00:00:07.799" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">some years fast got involved because we</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.929" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">we were sent the letters that dr.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s Dean and then vice provost</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:27.630" style="s2">him and they worried us so tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:30.949" style="s2">as people concerned about academic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.630" end="00:00:36.090" style="s2">freedom and the integrity of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.949" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">the the letters warned dr. Peterson to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">stomp saying publicly that he would</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:47.010" style="s2">refuse requests to use non-gendered or</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.510" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">or you know additional pronouns and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.010" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">is for us that was that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">serious matter very seriously incursion</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">on the freedom of teachers to teach as</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:04.619" style="s2">they will teaching has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">the rapport between the professor and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.619" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">the students between classroom dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:11.670" style="s2">and the honesty and sincerity that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">teaching requires we thought were</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.670" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">infringed by by these orders and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">especially orders coming from from</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">Dean&#39;s and department that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">department had and so we wrote two</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">letters to University of Toronto about</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">this so we&#39;re very privileged to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:34.310" style="s2">dr. Peterson with us today to talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">about these things maybe also some more</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.310" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">theoretical and abstract things than his</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">own particular case he&#39;s going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:48.970" style="s2">to us about why freedom of speech is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:55.720" style="s2">just another value Lex Peterson thanks</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.970" end="00:01:59.290" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.720" end="00:02:01.790" style="s2">so I thought I&#39;d start I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.290" end="00:02:04.220" style="s2">approach this from three directions but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.790" end="00:02:08.180" style="s2">I went three sections I thought I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.220" end="00:02:11.420" style="s2">start by just letting you know why I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.180" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">objecting specifically to Bill c16 I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.420" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">made three videos in late September and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:23.510" style="s2">one of them criticized Bill c16 one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:25.790" style="s2">them criticized the University of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.510" end="00:02:28.790" style="s2">Toronto administration&#39;s the Human</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.780" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">which I thought was and still think was</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.240" end="00:02:46.490" style="s2">reprehensible and I don&#39;t even remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.230" style="s2">what the other one was about but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.490" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter those were it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.230" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">the first one the one on Bill c16 that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:55.450" style="s2">caused most of the furor surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:03:01.880" style="s2">enough and I said I wouldn&#39;t use the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.450" end="00:03:05.959" style="s2">made-up what I consider neologisms that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.880" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">purport to describe the status the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.959" end="00:03:12.770" style="s2">status of people whose sexual identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:15.290" style="s2">is ambiguous because that isn&#39;t how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.770" end="00:03:18.920" style="s2">looked to me it looked to me like these</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.290" end="00:03:21.380" style="s2">words like Z and Z and so forth were the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.920" end="00:03:24.830" style="s2">linguistic vanguard of a intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.380" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">movement that I would say detest is</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.830" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">probably the right description and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:33.880" style="s2">that&#39;s this strange blend of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:36.440" style="s2">post-modernism and Marxism that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.880" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">emerged to occupy the bulk of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.440" end="00:03:40.790" style="s2">humanities and a good chunk of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.970" end="00:03:43.310" style="s2">social sciences and so that was the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.790" end="00:03:45.140" style="s2">first thing is that I&#39;m not using those</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.310" end="00:03:47.300" style="s2">words that was the first thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.140" end="00:03:49.250" style="s2">personal right is that that&#39;s not a form</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.300" end="00:03:52.220" style="s2">of linguistic game that I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.250" end="00:03:55.880" style="s2">play and I have my reasons for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.220" end="00:03:59.270" style="s2">the second was I regard the any</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.880" end="00:04:01.400" style="s2">legislation that compels people to use a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.270" end="00:04:02.490" style="s2">certain kind of language as a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.400" end="00:04:03.990" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.490" end="00:04:05.820" style="s2">of all dangerous piece of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.990" end="00:04:09.960" style="s2">directly but also a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.820" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">precedent I mean there are limits on</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.960" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">free speech that are already reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.970" end="00:04:16.890" style="s2">well instantiated in the law you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">incite a crime you can&#39;t threaten</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.890" end="00:04:22.980" style="s2">someone bodily in a believable manner</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">you can&#39;t libel someone we already have</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.980" end="00:04:28.530" style="s2">reasonable restrictions on on what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:31.290" style="s2">can&#39;t say but we&#39;ve never had</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.530" end="00:04:33.150" style="s2">legislation that required you to use a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.290" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">certain language except in certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:36.750" style="s2">commercial applications so for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">if you sell tobacco you have to put a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.750" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">warning on it but the United States</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:44.100" style="s2">Supreme Court decided I believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:46.770" style="s2">in the 1940s that similar attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.100" end="00:04:48.770" style="s2">compel speech on the part of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.770" end="00:04:51.450" style="s2">in non-commercial settings was</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.770" end="00:04:53.010" style="s2">unconstitutional and and I know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.450" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have any direct bearing on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">Canadian law but certainly the principle</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:05:00.750" style="s2">does and then I was also very see one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:03.000" style="s2">the problems with a piece of legislation</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.750" end="00:05:04.590" style="s2">and this is I suppose the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.000" end="00:05:06.150" style="s2">interpreting a text as the post</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.590" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">modernists would say is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:10.230" style="s2">easy to get the level of interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">right right because interpreting a text</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.230" end="00:05:13.800" style="s2">you can look at this look at the letters</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:15.570" style="s2">that happens with biblical</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.800" end="00:05:17.040" style="s2">interpretation very often you can look</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.570" end="00:05:18.450" style="s2">at the individual words you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.040" end="00:05:20.070" style="s2">the phrases you can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.450" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">sentences you can look at the paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.070" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">you could look at the work as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">and then you also have to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:28.230" style="s2">context within which the work is being</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:29.700" style="s2">interpreted in order to come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.230" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">interpretation of anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.700" end="00:05:34.980" style="s2">complex and so when you see a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">legislation it isn&#39;t obvious what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.980" end="00:05:40.650" style="s2">legislation is actually intended to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">despite what it&#39;s purported to do and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.650" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t obvious what level of analysis to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">pick when you&#39;re going to criticize it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">and in some ways bill c16 you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.430" end="00:05:51.600" style="s2">regard it as innocuous just as an</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.290" end="00:05:59.040" style="s2">about the whole notion of ascribing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">rights to groups to begin with we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.040" end="00:06:04.200" style="s2">already far down that path but and you</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.810" end="00:06:56.980" style="s2">validated my fears and so that was a</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.040" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">absolutely reprehensible and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.290" end="00:08:03.370" style="s2">because it&#39;s designed to cast the</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.830" end="00:09:16.960" style="s2">that makes me a racist so the first part</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.950" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">of the argument about what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.960" end="00:09:20.860" style="s2">my videos was actually whether or not I</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:23.740" style="s2">was racist at transphobic and all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.860" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">that but the point that I was making the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.740" end="00:09:29.530" style="s2">technical specific technical point was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:31.720" style="s2">that they claimed that those four</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:37.960" style="s2">patently false and it is by any</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.140" end="00:09:39.940" style="s2">reasonable definition of false and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.960" end="00:09:42.610" style="s2">know that it&#39;s part of a much broader</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.940" end="00:09:44.650" style="s2">propaganda exercise as evidenced by the</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.360" end="00:09:57.339" style="s2">their sexual proclivity and you can look</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.339" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">cartoon and decide for yourself by its</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:19.210" style="s2">well god only knows but as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.780" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">concerned having analyzed the context</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:24.550" style="s2">within which this bill arose and within</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:27.280" style="s2">which it will be interpreted I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.550" end="00:10:30.010" style="s2">to go for the furthering the postmodern</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.010" end="00:10:34.030" style="s2">that&#39;s thoroughly disproved I would also</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.780" end="00:10:36.490" style="s2">like to inform you that I&#39;ve had plenty</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.030" end="00:10:38.680" style="s2">of letters from transgender people at</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.490" end="00:10:40.900" style="s2">least thirty and only one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.680" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">critical of what I&#39;m doing because they</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.900" end="00:10:44.300" style="s2">they acclaim and as have</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:48.710" style="s2">as have many of the people I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.300" end="00:10:53.660" style="s2">to that the idea that a group of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.710" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">activists self can self nominate as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.660" end="00:10:57.500" style="s2">representatives of a given group and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:11:00.980" style="s2">then speak for them as if they have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.500" end="00:11:03.520" style="s2">modernist voice is absolutely absurd and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.980" end="00:11:06.110" style="s2">it is it is completely ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.520" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">most of the transsexual people that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.110" end="00:11:10.820" style="s2">been contacting me have said the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.660" end="00:11:11.450" style="s2">thing which is these people don&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.820" end="00:11:13.400" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.450" end="00:11:15.890" style="s2">I wish they&#39;d shut up because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.400" end="00:11:18.940" style="s2">doing a lot more harm than good and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.890" end="00:11:23.270" style="s2">don&#39;t buy what they&#39;re doing anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.940" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">you know I think that the claim of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.270" end="00:11:27.500" style="s2">activist types to speak on behalf of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">groups that they purport to represent is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.500" end="00:11:31.339" style="s2">weak at best and I don&#39;t know why we</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.320" style="s2">ever assumed that it that their</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.339" end="00:11:35.060" style="s2">representation is valid except that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.320" end="00:11:37.100" style="s2">we&#39;re afraid to criticize that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.060" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">particular presupposition you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.100" end="00:11:41.000" style="s2">mean there&#39;s nothing more ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:42.650" style="s2">than assuming that someone is because</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.000" end="00:11:45.080" style="s2">someone is black that they speak for</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.650" end="00:11:46.120" style="s2">black people I mean I think I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.080" end="00:11:48.110" style="s2">think of anything that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.120" end="00:11:50.360" style="s2">particularly indicative of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.110" end="00:11:52.190" style="s2">fundamentally racist attitude than that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.360" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">you know well those people they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.190" end="00:11:58.520" style="s2">the same it&#39;s like yeah well sorry it</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:12:00.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t work out that way so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.520" end="00:12:02.780" style="s2">clarify all that so that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.710" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">have a little bit clearer idea about why</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.780" end="00:12:07.280" style="s2">I was doing what I was doing I mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:09.770" style="s2">people have asked so to speak why I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.280" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2">chose to die on that particular Hill and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.770" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">the answer is every every massive</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:19.550" style="s2">conflict of ideas let&#39;s say manifests</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">itself in the minut and that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.550" end="00:12:23.690" style="s2">often difficult to gain any headway</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">because no matter where you draw the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.690" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">line it&#39;s arbitrary and and subject to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:31.280" style="s2">criticism and you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:33.830" style="s2">this happens to be about gender-neutral</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.280" end="00:12:36.200" style="s2">pronouns regarding transgender people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.830" end="00:12:37.940" style="s2">me is just more or less an accident it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.200" end="00:12:39.529" style="s2">could have been about almost any number</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.940" end="00:12:41.750" style="s2">of other things and but I would also</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.529" end="00:12:43.490" style="s2">like to suggest that what should have</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.750" end="00:12:46.670" style="s2">happened with what I did was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.490" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">right I made some videos that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.670" end="00:12:52.339" style="s2">relatively obscure academic and I made</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:54.170" style="s2">some videos in my private time that were</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.339" end="00:12:55.850" style="s2">you know pretty badly produced because</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.170" end="00:12:57.410" style="s2">they&#39;re just amateur and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:12:59.209" style="s2">I was trying to straighten out my</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.410" end="00:13:01.370" style="s2">thinking about a couple of issues the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.209" end="00:13:04.490" style="s2">anti unconscious bias training for</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.370" end="00:13:07.910" style="s2">example and also this legislative mess</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.490" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">and obviously it struck a major chord</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.910" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">and that to me is indication that my</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:15.079" style="s2">original supposition was correct and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">that there was far more going on under</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.079" end="00:13:18.920" style="s2">the surface than there was at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.509" style="s2">surface I mean I you know like I said</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.920" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to pick the proper</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.509" end="00:13:25.639" style="s2">level of analysis but one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:27.800" style="s2">you justify your choices by observing</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.639" end="00:13:29.750" style="s2">the impact of your choice of level of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.800" end="00:13:31.490" style="s2">analysis and seeing if it&#39;s if the</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.290" end="00:14:01.550" style="s2">from a practical perspective why I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.649" style="s2">believe that the idea of freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.550" end="00:14:05.889" style="s2">speech is not just another value among</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.649" end="00:14:09.490" style="s2">other values and I would say that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.889" end="00:14:13.339" style="s2">simplest reason for that is that speech</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.490" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t precisely a mechanism it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.350" end="00:14:27.439" style="s2">speech is the process by which all ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.930" end="00:14:29.269" style="s2">are generated and and I want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.439" end="00:14:31.699" style="s2">clear why I believe that to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.269" end="00:14:34.250" style="s2">with speech specifically because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.699" end="00:14:36.290" style="s2">might say well no that&#39;s thought but but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.250" end="00:14:38.839" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right because</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.290" end="00:14:40.670" style="s2">the thing is that thought is a far more</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.699" end="00:15:01.509" style="s2">case you know are the very linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.850" end="00:15:04.699" style="s2">mechanisms by which we formulate our our</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.180" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">not produce and so it doesn&#39;t mean they</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.510" end="00:15:40.610" style="s2">can&#39;t further the ideas but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">is that you know we&#39;re born into a</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.299" end="00:18:29.870" style="s2">often someone who&#39;s reading for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:32.029" style="s2">it&#39;s much more difficult to listen to</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.029" end="00:18:36.110" style="s2">because there&#39;s a deadness about reading</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.070" end="00:19:13.880" style="s2">because you&#39;re just not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.020" end="00:19:16.130" style="s2">thinking and so you have to stumble</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.100" end="00:19:28.909" style="s2">improve upon that performance is by</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.510" style="s2">improve their focus and find out where</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.290" end="00:21:02.870" style="s2">and there&#39;s tremendous social pressure</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:04.550" style="s2">generally speaking to manifest that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:07.010" style="s2">implicit ideal as closely as possible</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.550" end="00:21:09.170" style="s2">because otherwise people disapprove of</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.170" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">or criticize your and so on you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.560" end="00:21:17.180" style="s2">be allowed to be exposed to that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:20.330" style="s2">corrective feedback because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.180" end="00:21:22.700" style="s2">you drift and and you become subject to</p>

<p begin="00:21:22.700" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">and I mean I&#39;ve seen that very many</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.260" end="00:21:27.800" style="s2">times in my clinical practice because</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.540" style="s2">well first of all I have some isolated</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.800" end="00:21:32.990" style="s2">people that come to see me and all they</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.540" end="00:21:34.670" style="s2">do is talk I just listen I mean because</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.990" end="00:21:37.220" style="s2">they don&#39;t have anyone else around and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.670" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">they need someone to run their narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.220" end="00:21:41.060" style="s2">by to keep their minds organized they</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:42.800" style="s2">can&#39;t do it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.060" end="00:21:45.170" style="s2">they can&#39;t do it without listening to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.800" end="00:21:47.350" style="s2">themselves talk even because for most</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.170" end="00:21:49.730" style="s2">people talking is how they think and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.350" end="00:21:51.380" style="s2">talking socially is even more how they</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.730" end="00:21:52.850" style="s2">think and I mean that literally</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.380" end="00:21:54.260" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that metaphorically is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.850" end="00:21:56.870" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s true for almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.260" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">everyone you know I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.870" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">people who are trained academically who</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">can actually think but to think you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:05.990" style="s2">to divide yourself into sub</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:07.670" style="s2">personalities I suppose each of which</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.990" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">has a different opinion a well</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:11.450" style="s2">elucidated differing opinion and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:13.250" style="s2">you have to let those different elements</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.450" end="00:22:14.540" style="s2">of your personality have an internal</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.250" end="00:22:16.520" style="s2">dialogue and you have to draw</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.540" end="00:22:18.200" style="s2">conclusions from that it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.520" end="00:22:19.910" style="s2">difficult for people to do that and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.200" end="00:22:23.390" style="s2">radically overestimate the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.910" end="00:22:25.430" style="s2">which they do young said at one point</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.390" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">that people don&#39;t think so much as as</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.430" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">thoughts appear in their head and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:31.960" style="s2">believe them which i think is a much</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:35.210" style="s2">more accurate way of describing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.960" end="00:22:36.740" style="s2">general because true thought is not only</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.210" end="00:22:39.170" style="s2">that the thoughts arise in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.740" end="00:22:40.850" style="s2">it&#39;s that you look at the thought and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.170" end="00:22:42.440" style="s2">then you critique it right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.850" end="00:22:44.390" style="s2">separate yourself from the thought and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.440" end="00:22:46.490" style="s2">decide whether or not it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.390" end="00:22:48.200" style="s2">that&#39;s more like an editing function and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.490" end="00:22:50.270" style="s2">you know it takes a long time to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.200" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">good editor a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.270" end="00:22:56.120" style="s2">and it just doesn&#39;t happen generally</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:58.160" style="s2">speaking so well so I would say well</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.120" end="00:23:00.200" style="s2">without free speech there&#39;s no true</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.160" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">thought and then you might say well who</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.200" end="00:23:04.670" style="s2">the hell cares whether or not we think</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:06.410" style="s2">and I think the answer to that is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.670" end="00:23:07.670" style="s2">straightforward I mean you might think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.410" end="00:23:09.650" style="s2">it&#39;s so obvious that it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.670" end="00:23:11.180" style="s2">explanation but there very few things</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.650" end="00:23:14.600" style="s2">that are so obvious they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.180" end="00:23:16.460" style="s2">explanation so the reason you think is</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.600" end="00:23:18.440" style="s2">so that the world doesn&#39;t smack you as</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.460" end="00:23:20.060" style="s2">hard as it might fundamentally you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.440" end="00:23:22.550" style="s2">and I really mean this technically</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.060" end="00:23:24.560" style="s2">because the way that people evolve the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.550" end="00:23:27.230" style="s2">capacity to thought for thought was that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.560" end="00:23:30.110" style="s2">the prefrontal cortex which mediates a</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.230" end="00:23:32.150" style="s2">lot of voluntary linguistic ability</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.110" end="00:23:33.800" style="s2">actually emerged over the course of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.150" end="00:23:35.990" style="s2">evolutionary history out of the motor</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">cortex and so that&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.990" end="00:23:40.220" style="s2">thing to understand because it means</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:42.530" style="s2">that you know animals basically think by</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.220" end="00:23:44.000" style="s2">moving and the problem with that is if</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.530" end="00:23:46.250" style="s2">you think by moving and you make the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.000" end="00:23:48.550" style="s2">wrong move then you&#39;re dead whereas what</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.250" end="00:23:51.320" style="s2">human beings can do is they can generate</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.550" end="00:23:53.210" style="s2">fictional avatars of themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.320" end="00:23:55.820" style="s2">fictional worlds and they can run the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.210" end="00:23:57.590" style="s2">avatars as simulations and the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.820" end="00:23:59.540" style="s2">get killed they don&#39;t express in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.590" end="00:24:01.610" style="s2">behavior and I mean you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.540" end="00:24:02.930" style="s2">with words too although people you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.610" end="00:24:04.430" style="s2">originally would have done it mostly</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.930" end="00:24:04.700" style="s2">with images they&#39;d do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.430" end="00:24:07.880" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.700" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">drama and so the reason that you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.880" end="00:24:12.950" style="s2">and I think it was George was a Alfred</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:15.020" style="s2">North Whitehead that said this I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.950" end="00:24:16.550" style="s2">that I&#39;m not absolutely sure the reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.020" end="00:24:18.710" style="s2">you think is so that your thoughts can</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.550" end="00:24:21.410" style="s2">die instead of you and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.710" end="00:24:24.440" style="s2">brilliant brilliant brilliant phrase and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.410" end="00:24:27.620" style="s2">absolutely the case so if you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.440" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">properly then you kill off the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.620" end="00:24:32.060" style="s2">that if you acted out would kill you or</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:33.860" style="s2">at least cause you suffering or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.060" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">cause suffering to the people around you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.860" end="00:24:39.020" style="s2">and since it&#39;s more or less obvious a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.070" end="00:24:40.670" style="s2">priority that suffering is worse than</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.020" end="00:24:43.940" style="s2">not suffering under most circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.670" end="00:24:45.740" style="s2">it seems reasonable to act in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.940" end="00:24:46.790" style="s2">that will minimize it to the degree that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.740" end="00:24:49.160" style="s2">that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.790" end="00:24:51.560" style="s2">and so you need clarity of thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.160" end="00:24:54.110" style="s2">because that helps guide you through a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.560" end="00:24:56.660" style="s2">world that&#39;s enshrouded in fog and full</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.110" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">of sharp objects and if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.660" end="00:25:01.880" style="s2">to stumble into them and impale yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.250" style="s2">then you should have sharp vision and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.880" end="00:25:05.810" style="s2">sharp capacity to communicate you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.250" end="00:25:07.160" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things I tell students</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.810" end="00:25:08.780" style="s2">when I&#39;m trying to teach them to write</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.160" end="00:25:10.760" style="s2">because they no one ever tells them why</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.780" end="00:25:12.920" style="s2">they should learn to write it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.760" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">learn to write so you can think and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.920" end="00:25:16.040" style="s2">learn to think so that the world doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:18.800" style="s2">treat you any more harshly than it</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.040" end="00:25:20.900" style="s2">absolutely has to and that&#39;s no joke you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.800" end="00:25:22.850" style="s2">know and if you if you&#39;re a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.900" end="00:25:24.590" style="s2">been around a bit you see very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.850" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">that people who sharpen their arguments</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.590" end="00:25:29.690" style="s2">properly and can articulate their</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:31.940" style="s2">position and defend it are always always</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.690" end="00:25:34.460" style="s2">the people who are most successful and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.940" end="00:25:37.010" style="s2">most compelling in that and that changed</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.460" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">the way structures function and and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.010" end="00:25:40.550" style="s2">also helped things continue in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:42.740" style="s2">proper path when they&#39;re running down</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.550" end="00:25:45.290" style="s2">the proper path it&#39;s no joke to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.740" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">articulate and to be able to think there</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.290" end="00:25:49.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s more powerful than</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:52.370" style="s2">that and that&#39;s a good segue into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.790" end="00:25:58.730" style="s2">second or the third part of what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.370" end="00:26:02.060" style="s2">wanted to talk to you about see since I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.730" end="00:26:05.870" style="s2">made those videos I&#39;ve become I guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.060" end="00:26:08.570" style="s2">the word is popular on yeah well in many</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.870" end="00:26:09.920" style="s2">ways by about November by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.570" end="00:26:12.550" style="s2">November last year there were more than</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.920" end="00:26:14.810" style="s2">200 newspaper articles about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.550" end="00:26:16.970" style="s2">consequences of the videos that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.810" end="00:26:18.290" style="s2">produced and and that those were like in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.970" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">press printed Artic</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.290" end="00:26:22.490" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about anything that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:24.590" style="s2">happened on YouTube and YouTube is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.490" end="00:26:27.370" style="s2">very strange phenomena let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.590" end="00:26:30.410" style="s2">it&#39;s far more powerful than you think so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.370" end="00:26:30.830" style="s2">just as an aside I was on a program last</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.410" end="00:26:32.810" style="s2">week</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.830" end="00:26:34.610" style="s2">hosted by a guy named Joe Rogan I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.810" end="00:26:37.610" style="s2">know how many of you know who Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.610" end="00:26:40.490" style="s2">is Joe Rogan gets 1.2 billion downloads</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.610" end="00:26:42.770" style="s2">of his podcasts a year you think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.490" end="00:26:45.740" style="s2">that like that&#39;s absolutely unparalleled</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.770" end="00:26:47.240" style="s2">and everybody under 30 is getting their</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.740" end="00:26:48.950" style="s2">news from either Facebook or from</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:51.230" style="s2">YouTube the old conventional media</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.950" end="00:26:54.410" style="s2">sources they&#39;re dead is they are so dead</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.230" end="00:26:56.330" style="s2">you can hardly believe it so YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.410" end="00:26:58.850" style="s2">one of the reasons I&#39;m bringing it up is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.330" end="00:27:01.520" style="s2">because YouTube is the first platform</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.850" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">that&#39;s produced for people the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.520" end="00:27:07.910" style="s2">to make the spoken word as far-reaching</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:10.010" style="s2">and permanent as the written word right</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.910" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a complete cultural revolution</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.010" end="00:27:13.490" style="s2">it&#39;s the first time it&#39;s ever happened I</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.710" style="s2">mean it wouldn&#39;t have to be YouTube it</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.490" end="00:27:17.900" style="s2">just turns out that that&#39;s the platform</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.710" end="00:27:26.750" style="s2">that got there first but it&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.900" end="00:27:29.150" style="s2">and anyways the reason that that that my</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.750" end="00:27:31.940" style="s2">that I became popular I think was partly</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.150" end="00:27:34.670" style="s2">because of the political philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.940" end="00:27:37.310" style="s2">videos that I made but then when people</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.670" end="00:27:39.830" style="s2">came to my website to watch them they</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.310" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">stayed generally speaking to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.830" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">lectures that I had been posting on</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:49.610" style="s2">there since 2013 and those were derived</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:51.980" style="s2">from work I did on a book called maps of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.610" end="00:27:53.930" style="s2">meaning which I published in 1999 and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.980" end="00:27:56.780" style="s2">see what I was trying to do with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.930" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">book was to sort something out that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.780" end="00:28:02.510" style="s2">very complex and that was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:06.860" style="s2">growing up and the Cold War was raging</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.510" end="00:28:08.780" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t understand precisely why we</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.860" end="00:28:10.910" style="s2">had divided into two armed camps around</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.780" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">our respective ideological positions</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.910" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">either why those ideological positions</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">were so important that people would risk</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:20.150" style="s2">the destruction of the world to protect</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:22.310" style="s2">them let&#39;s say or why it was those two</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.150" end="00:28:24.820" style="s2">particular ideologies or whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.310" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">this was just a difference of opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.820" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">right which would be that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:30.560" style="s2">more postmodern view as there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:32.300" style="s2">ways that you can organize societies in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.560" end="00:28:34.040" style="s2">the West we haven&#39;t organized</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.300" end="00:28:36.200" style="s2">society one way but that&#39;s one of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.040" end="00:28:38.570" style="s2">plethora of potential ways of organizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.200" end="00:28:40.220" style="s2">society and let&#39;s say the Communists had</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.570" end="00:28:41.900" style="s2">decided to organize their society</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.220" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">another way and human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.900" end="00:28:47.590" style="s2">infinitely malleable and so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">social structures that we occupy are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.590" end="00:28:52.010" style="s2">arbitrary in some sense and matter of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:53.450" style="s2">opinion and may be collective opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.010" end="00:28:56.030" style="s2">but nonetheless still a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.450" end="00:28:58.370" style="s2">opinion and I thought well is it the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.030" end="00:29:01.250" style="s2">case that the values that we hold to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.370" end="00:29:03.890" style="s2">true in the West are merely based upon</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.250" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">opinion and so I started to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.890" end="00:29:10.760" style="s2">that and and the conclusion that I came</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.050" style="s2">to as a consequence of hitting the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.760" end="00:29:14.510" style="s2">question from multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.050" end="00:29:17.290" style="s2">perspectives was that that was not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.510" end="00:29:19.220" style="s2">reasonable way of formulating of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.290" end="00:29:22.340" style="s2">interpreting the evidence and so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.220" end="00:29:24.850" style="s2">looked at neural evidence from neuro</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.340" end="00:29:30.470" style="s2">psychology and neuroscience mostly</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.850" end="00:29:31.970" style="s2">mostly based at least in part on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.470" end="00:29:33.470" style="s2">work of someone named Geoffrey gray it</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.970" end="00:29:35.890" style="s2">was a very good psychologist very</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.470" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">interested in anxiety I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.890" end="00:29:41.330" style="s2">general behavioral psychology looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:44.840" style="s2">literature and I looked at mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.330" end="00:29:46.820" style="s2">I could see a pattern emerging across</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.840" end="00:29:48.260" style="s2">all of those which i think is a nice way</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.820" end="00:29:49.790" style="s2">of determining whether or not something</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.260" end="00:29:52.040" style="s2">exists like it&#39;s one thing to see a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.790" end="00:29:53.810" style="s2">pattern in one set of data but if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.040" end="00:29:55.610" style="s2">can see the same pattern and another set</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.810" end="00:29:57.530" style="s2">that&#39;s quite historically distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.610" end="00:29:59.900" style="s2">the first and then see the same pattern</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.530" end="00:30:01.670" style="s2">in another set and then another set then</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.900" end="00:30:03.830" style="s2">the probability that that&#39;s a spurious</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.670" end="00:30:05.840" style="s2">pattern starts to decrease quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.830" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">radically and so I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.840" end="00:30:15.290" style="s2">pattern was spurious and so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.860" end="00:30:15.710" style="s2">tell you what I think I what would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.290" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.710" end="00:30:21.020" style="s2">extracted this is very complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:25.540" style="s2">makes a difficult transition in the talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.020" end="00:30:25.540" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to read something first</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.260" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">this is from the from the Gospel of John</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.650" end="00:30:35.450" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most famous lines in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.510" end="00:30:37.670" style="s2">Bible in the beginning was the word and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.450" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">the Word was with God and the Word was</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.670" end="00:30:41.900" style="s2">God</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:43.670" style="s2">it&#39;s very strange idea because from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.900" end="00:30:45.880" style="s2">cosmological perspective because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.670" end="00:30:49.250" style="s2">posits that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.880" end="00:30:51.890" style="s2">conscious or cognitive about the origin</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.250" end="00:30:54.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a necessary cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.890" end="00:30:56.840" style="s2">element to the origin and I think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.920" end="00:30:59.150" style="s2">that essentially as something associated</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.840" end="00:31:00.620" style="s2">with consciousness and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.150" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.620" end="00:31:05.630" style="s2">between consciousness and being we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:07.400" style="s2">understand consciousness at all but it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.630" end="00:31:09.230" style="s2">seems integrally associated at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.400" end="00:31:11.300" style="s2">with our individual beings because one</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.230" end="00:31:13.100" style="s2">of the things that we seem to not doubt</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.300" end="00:31:15.320" style="s2">is that we are in fact conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.100" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">that&#39;s or other people and if I treat</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.320" end="00:31:18.470" style="s2">someone as if they&#39;re not conscious well</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:20.780" style="s2">they tend not to be very happy about</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.470" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">that so they&#39;ll certainly object to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.780" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">so despite what we might say we believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:28.990" style="s2">we certainly act as if we regard all</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:32.090" style="s2">other human beings as conscious and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.990" end="00:31:34.280" style="s2">the consciousness is that prerequisite</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.090" end="00:31:39.830" style="s2">further for the existence of their</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.280" end="00:31:44.059" style="s2">experience so anyway so that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.830" end="00:31:47.270" style="s2">this emphasis in in this book that is at</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.870" end="00:32:09.950" style="s2">pointing that out because you can take</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.940" end="00:32:11.450" style="s2">this particular perspective and you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.950" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">look at it from very a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.450" end="00:32:16.010" style="s2">different intellectual sources and still</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.340" end="00:32:21.110" style="s2">derive an analog of the of the claim</p>

<p begin="00:32:21.110" end="00:32:24.980" style="s2">I want you to keep that in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.059" end="00:32:26.780" style="s2">your mind for a moment now that idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.980" end="00:32:28.490" style="s2">that that the word was there at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.780" end="00:32:30.550" style="s2">beginning of creation that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.490" end="00:32:33.920" style="s2">old idea it&#39;s older than the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.550" end="00:32:35.720" style="s2">judeo-christian context from which I</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.920" end="00:32:37.790" style="s2">extracted it so for example in Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.720" end="00:32:39.620" style="s2">there was a god named Fatah who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.790" end="00:32:41.750" style="s2">major god I may be pronouncing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.620" end="00:32:43.580" style="s2">wrong but as far as the Egyptians were</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.750" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">concerned he was the original creator</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.580" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">and he created as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:49.429" style="s2">thinking but more specifically as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:50.990" style="s2">consequence of speaking so again there</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.429" end="00:32:53.960" style="s2">was this idea that there was this</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.990" end="00:32:56.540" style="s2">primacy of speaking as a force that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.960" end="00:32:58.250" style="s2">brings being into existence and then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.540" end="00:32:59.360" style="s2">see the same thing in the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.250" end="00:33:01.400" style="s2">context too</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.360" end="00:33:04.760" style="s2">their creation myth was called the ANU</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.400" end="00:33:07.940" style="s2">malysh and there&#39;s a God in that story</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.760" end="00:33:09.860" style="s2">and that story apparently is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.940" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">places from which the creation story in</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.860" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">the in that Bible was extracted that God</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:19.250" style="s2">is named Marduk and mardik is a God that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:21.650" style="s2">fights chaos and creates the world out</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.250" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">of the consequences and he he has a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.650" end="00:33:25.730" style="s2">variety of different attributes one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:27.410" style="s2">which his head is ringed with eyes so he</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.730" end="00:33:29.750" style="s2">can see in all direction so there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.410" end="00:33:32.510" style="s2">much emphasis among the Mesopotamians on</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.750" end="00:33:35.030" style="s2">the primacy of attention let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.510" end="00:33:36.470" style="s2">he can also speak magic words and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.030" end="00:33:38.299" style="s2">the fact that he&#39;s equipped with this</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.470" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">massive capacity for tension and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.299" end="00:33:42.410" style="s2">ability to speak magic words that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">enables him to go and fight the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.410" end="00:33:46.610" style="s2">of chaos roughly speaking and to cut her</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:49.040" style="s2">into pieces and make up the world one of</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.040" end="00:33:53.630" style="s2">makes ingenious things out of the combat</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.770" end="00:33:55.880" style="s2">with time out and time at is this</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.880" end="00:34:00.770" style="s2">represents the sort of the formless</p>

<p begin="00:34:00.770" end="00:34:06.140" style="s2">consciousness extracts structure no</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.590" end="00:34:08.840" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it so</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.140" end="00:34:10.399" style="s2">that idea is quite widespread to vary in</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.840" end="00:34:12.260" style="s2">fact it&#39;s an idea that informs</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.399" end="00:34:14.570" style="s2">mythological structures everywhere as</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.260" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">far as I can tell there&#39;s this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.570" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a dynamic between what you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:22.280" style="s2">and what you don&#39;t know you can think</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:23.720" style="s2">about those as different domains of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.280" end="00:34:25.399" style="s2">reality what you know and what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.720" end="00:34:27.379" style="s2">know and the thing that mediates between</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.399" end="00:34:29.859" style="s2">what you know and what you don&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.379" end="00:34:32.270" style="s2">this thing that has the attribute of of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.859" end="00:34:34.369" style="s2">spoken wisdom it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.270" end="00:34:36.379" style="s2">and here&#39;s here&#39;s a way that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.369" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">complicated idea it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.379" end="00:34:40.730" style="s2">understand and it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.820" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">difficult to understand but the I can</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.730" end="00:34:46.070" style="s2">give you some sense of it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:49.580" style="s2">phenomenological idea I suppose imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.070" end="00:34:52.399" style="s2">that you that I don&#39;t know maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.580" end="00:34:54.290" style="s2">have it yeah maybe you&#39;re a medical</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.399" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">student the medical pre-med student</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.290" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">right you want to go to medical school</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.580" end="00:34:59.869" style="s2">and so you&#39;re busily beetling away on</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:02.119" style="s2">your on your courses you&#39;re doing all</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.869" end="00:35:03.890" style="s2">right you know then you go take the MCAT</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.119" end="00:35:07.130" style="s2">and you score it to say twentieth</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.890" end="00:35:10.090" style="s2">percentile which of course 20% of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.130" end="00:35:13.000" style="s2">do and that will</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.090" end="00:35:15.490" style="s2">as quite a shock to you no doubt because</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.000" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">you go in there in the world that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.490" end="00:35:20.500" style="s2">understand and in that world you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:22.690" style="s2">competent let&#39;s say to become a medical</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.500" end="00:35:25.060" style="s2">doctor and when you open the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.690" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">and you look at the number then well</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.060" end="00:35:30.370" style="s2">then your world crumbles and collapses</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:32.590" style="s2">and what it collapses into I would say</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.370" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">is equivalent to this formless chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.590" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">that the ancients believed was the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:39.010" style="s2">ground of being and it&#39;s this place</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:41.800" style="s2">where confusion reigns right in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.010" end="00:35:43.990" style="s2">word for the chaos that God orders with</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.800" end="00:35:46.680" style="s2">the word at the beginning of Genesis is</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.990" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">often translated as chaos or confusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.680" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">now when you think well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">formulated a world that you inhabit with</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.400" end="00:35:55.270" style="s2">a particular link with grass and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:57.700" style="s2">logical structure it&#39;s predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.270" end="00:35:59.710" style="s2">certain axioms of belief like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.700" end="00:36:02.080" style="s2">you&#39;re competent to be a medical doctor</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.710" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">and then you receive a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.080" end="00:36:07.720" style="s2">information that makes not only your</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.660" end="00:36:10.180" style="s2">present understanding of yourself no</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.720" end="00:36:13.270" style="s2">longer relevant or correct but also your</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.180" end="00:36:17.860" style="s2">past understanding of yourself and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.270" end="00:36:21.070" style="s2">your future who gone right long gone</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.860" end="00:36:23.560" style="s2">where gone into what well gone into</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.070" end="00:36:25.420" style="s2">chaos roughly speaking and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.560" end="00:36:27.310" style="s2">in very rough shape as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.420" end="00:36:29.650" style="s2">that and if you do manage to lever</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.310" end="00:36:31.420" style="s2">yourself out of that chaotic condition</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.650" end="00:36:33.130" style="s2">that you now find yourself in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.420" end="00:36:35.170" style="s2">going to essentially do it with thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.130" end="00:36:36.970" style="s2">and dialogue right because you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.170" end="00:36:38.440" style="s2">to talk to people what did I do wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.970" end="00:36:40.780" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with the way I thought how</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.440" end="00:36:42.910" style="s2">could I have been so misled by what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.780" end="00:36:45.630" style="s2">believed what should I do now who</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.910" end="00:36:47.620" style="s2">actually am I all of that is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.630" end="00:36:50.980" style="s2">reconstructing yourself from the ashes</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.620" end="00:36:53.800" style="s2">so to speak I would say that and you do</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.980" end="00:36:56.530" style="s2">that with with with with speech and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.800" end="00:36:59.830" style="s2">do that with true speech and so through</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.530" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">speech is what what redeems you from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.830" end="00:37:04.390" style="s2">chaos of unstructured being and so so</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.340" style="s2">then that&#39;s that&#39;s another thing to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.390" end="00:37:10.710" style="s2">think about for a moment and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.340" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">going to bring up this final piece and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.710" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">we can think about it too</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.180" end="00:37:28.130" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.990" style="s2">these ideas came to be because they came</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.130" end="00:37:32.599" style="s2">to be over a very long period of time so</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.990" end="00:37:35.990" style="s2">the god Marduk for example he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.599" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">assembled you could say as the empires</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.990" end="00:37:40.970" style="s2">of the ancient Middle East as the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.170" end="00:37:42.740" style="s2">people of the ancient Middle East came</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.970" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">together and they each had their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.740" end="00:37:46.220" style="s2">deities that represented their highest</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.630" end="00:37:48.819" style="s2">values and when they came together those</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.220" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">deities had to be amalgamated and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.819" end="00:37:53.329" style="s2">tribe a has its highest value and tri B</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.309" style="s2">has its highest value and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.329" end="00:37:57.050" style="s2">embodied that&#39;s the deity element and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.309" end="00:37:59.300" style="s2">they come together and then the deities</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.050" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">and some sense have to have a war to</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.300" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">figure out who&#39;s the top god and so if</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:06.559" style="s2">you assemble a few hundred tribes out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">that comes a conceptualization of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.559" end="00:38:11.990" style="s2">top god that was Marduk for example in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:14.390" style="s2">Mesopotamia and he usually absorbs the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.990" end="00:38:15.800" style="s2">names of all the previous gods and as he</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.390" end="00:38:18.290" style="s2">sort of emerged as the king of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.800" end="00:38:20.270" style="s2">hierarchy and so so you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.290" end="00:38:22.730" style="s2">if you think about the expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.270" end="00:38:25.579" style="s2">deity as the projection of the highest</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.730" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">ideal of the tribe and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.579" end="00:38:29.240" style="s2">that&#39;s being worked out over perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:30.770" style="s2">millennia especially with people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.240" end="00:38:31.880" style="s2">have an oral tradition and then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.770" end="00:38:34.130" style="s2">bring those different tribes together</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.880" end="00:38:36.410" style="s2">what happens is the highest ideals in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.130" end="00:38:38.630" style="s2">their embodied form have what you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.410" end="00:38:40.220" style="s2">think of metaphorically as a war and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.630" end="00:38:43.220" style="s2">war of gods in heaven by the way is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.220" end="00:38:45.829" style="s2">very ancient and widespread mythological</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.220" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">motif and out of that war arises what</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.829" end="00:38:50.630" style="s2">you might describe as a met have value</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:53.270" style="s2">and so the meta value would be the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.630" end="00:38:54.890" style="s2">highest value among a set of values and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.270" end="00:38:56.359" style="s2">the question would be well what would</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.890" end="00:38:58.040" style="s2">that value be what would that highest</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.359" end="00:39:00.109" style="s2">value be is there something about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.040" end="00:39:01.940" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s recognizable and say</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.109" end="00:39:04.220" style="s2">somewhat constant so that if you took a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.940" end="00:39:05.480" style="s2">hundred tribes here and amalgamated</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.220" end="00:39:07.250" style="s2">their ideals and you took a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.480" end="00:39:09.859" style="s2">tribes here to Malaga mated their ideals</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.250" end="00:39:11.450" style="s2">if the two sets of amalgamations would</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.859" end="00:39:13.400" style="s2">have a structural similarity to one</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.450" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">another and as far as I can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.400" end="00:39:17.450" style="s2">answer to that is yes and it&#39;s a logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.380" end="00:39:20.299" style="s2">answer because you&#39;d expect structural</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.450" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">similarity if you extract out a common a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.299" end="00:39:25.700" style="s2">common element from a very large number</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:27.720" style="s2">of constituent represented so for</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.700" end="00:39:30.390" style="s2">example if you take</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.720" end="00:39:32.280" style="s2">a large number of female faces and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.390" end="00:39:34.080" style="s2">average them so I&#39;m not talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.280" end="00:39:36.840" style="s2">the average face I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.080" end="00:39:39.510" style="s2">average face it&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.840" end="00:39:43.020" style="s2">the averaged female face is attractive</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.510" end="00:39:44.520" style="s2">and so is the averaged male face and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.020" end="00:39:47.010" style="s2">because it kind of constitutes the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.520" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">central human form and if it takes 64</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.010" end="00:39:52.170" style="s2">women and you extract out an averaged</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:54.510" style="s2">face and you take another 64 you get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.170" end="00:39:56.369" style="s2">same face well then maybe it takes more</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.510" end="00:39:59.640" style="s2">than 64 but you get the point</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.369" end="00:40:03.859" style="s2">and so well so I was I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.640" end="00:40:07.530" style="s2">about how that that process came to be I</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.859" end="00:40:09.030" style="s2">decided to look at it even like to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.530" end="00:40:11.849" style="s2">back farther in time to try to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.030" end="00:40:15.720" style="s2">understand how it is that we formulated</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.849" end="00:40:17.970" style="s2">our values per se and especially given</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.720" end="00:40:19.980" style="s2">that at some point we weren&#39;t linguistic</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.970" end="00:40:22.109" style="s2">creatures at all right we separated from</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.980" end="00:40:24.390" style="s2">the common ancestors between us and</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.109" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">chimpanzees about 6 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.390" end="00:40:28.800" style="s2">sometime during that six million year</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:31.680" style="s2">process we started to be able to imitate</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.800" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">ourselves first and then represent</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.680" end="00:40:36.420" style="s2">ourselves in image and action and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:39.270" style="s2">only after that to start to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.420" end="00:40:41.400" style="s2">ourselves and so a lot of the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.270" end="00:40:43.770" style="s2">that we have is grounded in our</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.400" end="00:40:46.410" style="s2">embodiment but also in the shaping of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.770" end="00:40:49.500" style="s2">that embodiment across extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.410" end="00:40:52.589" style="s2">long periods of time so like there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.500" end="00:40:54.660" style="s2">implicit way of being in your form in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.589" end="00:40:56.760" style="s2">your embodied form but more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.660" end="00:40:59.609" style="s2">there&#39;s an implicit way of being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.760" end="00:41:02.310" style="s2">a consequence of the fact that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.609" end="00:41:05.820" style="s2">existed within hierarchical social</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.310" end="00:41:08.369" style="s2">structures for far longer than we were</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.820" end="00:41:10.920" style="s2">even sharing a common ancestor say with</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.369" end="00:41:12.599" style="s2">great apes so that&#39;s for maybe hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.920" end="00:41:15.570" style="s2">of millions of years with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.599" end="00:41:18.810" style="s2">being embedded in a hierarchy so then</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.570" end="00:41:20.580" style="s2">the question is something like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.810" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">embedded in a hierarchy and we have been</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.580" end="00:41:25.619" style="s2">forever that&#39;s about 350 million years</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.250" end="00:41:28.050" style="s2">by the way is there a set of attributes</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.619" end="00:41:30.510" style="s2">that tends reliably to move you up the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.050" end="00:41:33.060" style="s2">hierarchy because if there is you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.510" end="00:41:37.349" style="s2">being going up the hierarchy increases</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.060" end="00:41:39.060" style="s2">the probability of repres accesing more</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.349" end="00:41:41.340" style="s2">important to determine over the course</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.060" end="00:41:43.740" style="s2">of three hundred and fifty million years</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.340" end="00:41:45.510" style="s2">in sign of hierarchy then how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.740" end="00:41:48.270" style="s2">you ratchet yourself up the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.510" end="00:41:51.050" style="s2">reliably and you can think about that in</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:53.700" style="s2">some sense as the source of ideals um</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.050" end="00:41:55.590" style="s2">here&#39;s a kind of a concrete way of</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.700" end="00:41:58.290" style="s2">thinking about that you know if you get</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.590" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">a hundred men together they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.290" end="00:42:03.000" style="s2">they&#39;re going to organize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.740" style="s2">into a hierarchical structure they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.000" end="00:42:05.940" style="s2">to where they&#39;re going to stay chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.740" end="00:42:10.410" style="s2">and fight that that&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.940" end="00:42:12.450" style="s2">alternative and so but the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.410" end="00:42:14.520" style="s2">the people who are going to rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.450" end="00:42:16.590" style="s2">top they might rise to the top because</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.520" end="00:42:18.780" style="s2">of their sheer physical prowess and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.590" end="00:42:20.460" style="s2">power but they also might rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.780" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">top because they&#39;re very competent at</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.460" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">certain things and it&#39;s as if all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">men are going to get together and vote</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:29.460" style="s2">and maybe that would actually happen to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:31.020" style="s2">determine who best embodies the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.460" end="00:42:32.820" style="s2">of the group and who should be granted</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.020" end="00:42:34.980" style="s2">leadership and in an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.820" end="00:42:36.750" style="s2">context by the way that would also help</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:38.750" style="s2">ensure that that person would propagate</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.750" end="00:42:41.640" style="s2">their genes into the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.750" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not a trivial effect especially</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:46.020" style="s2">among men it&#39;s a big effect because</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:48.690" style="s2">roughly speaking half half of all men</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:50.630" style="s2">are are not represented ly successful so</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.690" end="00:42:54.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a wicked there&#39;s a wicked</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.630" end="00:42:56.370" style="s2">culling let&#39;s say among men well you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.510" end="00:42:58.680" style="s2">see this among chimpanzees as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.370" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">they have dominance hierarchies some</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.680" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">sort of chimps rise to the top you might</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:04.650" style="s2">think well that&#39;s the like caveman chimp</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:06.540" style="s2">who&#39;s best at pounding out all the all</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.650" end="00:43:08.310" style="s2">the rivals but it turns out that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.540" end="00:43:10.530" style="s2">not exactly the case and Fran&#39;s de Waal</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.310" end="00:43:12.870" style="s2">has done a very good job of detailing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.530" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">this with his work on chimpanzees in</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.870" end="00:43:17.400" style="s2">particular and he&#39;s found that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:19.740" style="s2">power-hungry tyrant sort of chimp can</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.400" end="00:43:22.620" style="s2">rule for a while but he tends to have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.740" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">very unstable Kingdom and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.620" end="00:43:26.610" style="s2">that is is he got very good at mutually</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:28.920" style="s2">grooming he&#39;s not that it&#39;s socially</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.610" end="00:43:30.990" style="s2">connecting with other males and he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.920" end="00:43:33.630" style="s2">popular among the females and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.990" end="00:43:35.790" style="s2">attend to the to the young essentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.630" end="00:43:38.580" style="s2">and so what happens is even if he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.790" end="00:43:40.920" style="s2">the meanest toughest guy on the block to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.580" end="00:43:42.660" style="s2">subordinate chimps team up they make</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.920" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">friends they groom each other and they</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.660" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">have each other&#39;s backs and in a one day</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:47.700" style="s2">he&#39;s having an off day because he ate</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:49.800" style="s2">too many fermented bananas the night</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.700" end="00:43:52.050" style="s2">before and like they just tear him into</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.800" end="00:43:54.609" style="s2">pieces and chimps are unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.050" end="00:43:57.150" style="s2">strong and unbelievably brutal</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.609" end="00:43:59.349" style="s2">they seem to have absolutely no internal</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.150" end="00:44:01.109" style="s2">regulation whatsoever of their</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.349" end="00:44:03.670" style="s2">aggression that all seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.109" end="00:44:05.289" style="s2">manifested outside in terms of dominance</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.670" end="00:44:07.180" style="s2">hierarchy control and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.289" end="00:44:08.650" style="s2">because they go on raiding parties into</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.180" end="00:44:09.999" style="s2">other chimp territories and when they</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.650" end="00:44:13.089" style="s2">find chimps that aren&#39;t part of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.999" end="00:44:15.670" style="s2">hierarchy they just rip them into pieces</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.089" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a scary thing if you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.670" end="00:44:19.180" style="s2">about our similarity with chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:21.039" style="s2">because we like to think we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.180" end="00:44:23.049" style="s2">internal controls over our aggression</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.039" end="00:44:25.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s not so bloody obvious I can</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.049" end="00:44:27.789" style="s2">tell you that anyways what do all found</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.480" end="00:44:31.989" style="s2">was that it&#39;s actually chimps that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.789" end="00:44:33.460" style="s2">more you might say humane although Jim</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.989" end="00:44:36.730" style="s2">Payne I don&#39;t know what the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.460" end="00:44:38.619" style="s2">is let&#39;s say humane that managed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.730" end="00:44:40.989" style="s2">produce hierarchies that are more stable</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.619" end="00:44:43.180" style="s2">and actually managed to stay alive on</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.989" end="00:44:45.130" style="s2">top of them for much longer periods of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.180" end="00:44:47.619" style="s2">time and he thinks about that is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.130" end="00:44:50.019" style="s2">emergence of an implicit morality right</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.619" end="00:44:51.430" style="s2">so morality that&#39;s acted out so then you</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.019" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">think well there there are different</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.430" end="00:44:56.019" style="s2">ways of climbing up a hierarchy there</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:57.789" style="s2">are worse in better ways the better ways</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.019" end="00:44:59.710" style="s2">allow you to live longer in a more</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.789" end="00:45:01.390" style="s2">stable hierarchy and the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.710" end="00:45:05.230" style="s2">payoff for that is that you leave more</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.390" end="00:45:07.569" style="s2">more descendants and so the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.230" end="00:45:09.880" style="s2">itself becomes a very powerful shaping</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.569" end="00:45:11.859" style="s2">mechanism that determines how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.880" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">people are going to adapt because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.859" end="00:45:15.789" style="s2">the primary method of selection so</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an ethic in there there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.789" end="00:45:18.970" style="s2">ethic that emerges from the social</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:21.339" style="s2">interactions but that&#39;s rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.970" end="00:45:24.220" style="s2">transformed into a biological selection</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.339" end="00:45:25.690" style="s2">device and so we&#39;re selected and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.220" end="00:45:30.039" style="s2">especially true among human beings</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.690" end="00:45:33.069" style="s2">because with chimps the females are</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.039" end="00:45:34.900" style="s2">indiscriminate mater&#39;s which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.069" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">that a female chimp in heat will mate</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.900" end="00:45:39.609" style="s2">with any male chimp</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:41.499" style="s2">now this the dominant males chase the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.609" end="00:45:43.150" style="s2">subordinate males away so they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.499" end="00:45:44.829" style="s2">more likely to leave offspring than the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.150" end="00:45:46.749" style="s2">subordinates but it&#39;s not because of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.829" end="00:45:50.859" style="s2">females but human females are different</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.749" end="00:45:53.049" style="s2">human females exert choice and quite</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.859" end="00:45:54.999" style="s2">brutal choice you might put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.049" end="00:45:56.380" style="s2">they&#39;re very choosy and it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.999" end="00:45:58.930" style="s2">things that seems to have distinguished</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.380" end="00:46:01.059" style="s2">us from chimpanzees and what roughly</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.930" end="00:46:03.309" style="s2">seems to happen is that the male</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.059" end="00:46:06.039" style="s2">dominance hierarchy elects men to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.309" end="00:46:08.300" style="s2">higher say rungs of the hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.039" end="00:46:10.100" style="s2">the females peel from the top</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.300" end="00:46:12.020" style="s2">and so that means that what you can say</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.100" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">is that human beings are the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.020" end="00:46:16.910" style="s2">of intense male dominance competition</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:18.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily dominance but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.910" end="00:46:22.370" style="s2">competition for the upper rungs of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.530" end="00:46:24.140" style="s2">hierarchy by female selection and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.370" end="00:46:27.170" style="s2">that&#39;s produced as far as I can tell a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.140" end="00:46:29.090" style="s2">powerful a powerful pattern of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.170" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">now the question is what&#39;s that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.090" end="00:46:35.120" style="s2">of behavior I would say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:38.030" style="s2">encapsulated in mythology in two forms</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.120" end="00:46:39.710" style="s2">and the question is well who should lead</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.030" end="00:46:42.230" style="s2">let&#39;s say that&#39;s the question who should</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.710" end="00:46:45.080" style="s2">lead that is the question who should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.230" end="00:46:47.960" style="s2">sovereign or maybe when it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.080" end="00:46:49.910" style="s2">abstracted what should be sovereign -</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.960" end="00:46:52.190" style="s2">the first question from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.910" end="00:46:55.700" style="s2">perspective is who should be sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.190" end="00:46:57.620" style="s2">but once you can abstract then the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.700" end="00:47:00.350" style="s2">principle of sovereignty can be detached</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.620" end="00:47:02.540" style="s2">from the leader and become a principal</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.350" end="00:47:04.790" style="s2">all on its own and that might be first</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.540" end="00:47:07.310" style="s2">expressed in mythological or imagistic</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.790" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">form dramatic form like the the good</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.310" end="00:47:11.420" style="s2">guys versus the bad guys or good versus</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:13.610" style="s2">evil we could say it like that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.420" end="00:47:15.590" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s embodied and acted out</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.610" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">far before it&#39;s extracted and turned</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.590" end="00:47:20.420" style="s2">into an abstracted representation well</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:22.360" style="s2">what seems to have happened is so one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.420" end="00:47:24.950" style="s2">the common themes for example in</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.360" end="00:47:26.810" style="s2">mythology is what&#39;s roughly being</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.950" end="00:47:29.800" style="s2">described as a hero myth and a hero myth</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.810" end="00:47:32.630" style="s2">involves someone who&#39;s part of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.800" end="00:47:33.170" style="s2">demolished community community under</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.630" end="00:47:34.670" style="s2">threat</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.170" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">the threats usually signified by</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.670" end="00:47:39.410" style="s2">something vaguely like a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">the dragon comes out it&#39;s eternal it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.410" end="00:47:43.730" style="s2">comes out to attack the village the hero</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:45.770" style="s2">comes out and confronts the dragon and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.730" end="00:47:48.290" style="s2">then frees the virgin for example or</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.770" end="00:47:50.150" style="s2">gets the gold and to me that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.290" end="00:47:52.220" style="s2">very well that is a very old story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.150" end="00:47:55.270" style="s2">in the annuity lish for example it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.220" end="00:47:58.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the story at the basis of very many</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.270" end="00:47:59.960" style="s2">what would you call it widely dispersed</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.070" end="00:48:01.700" style="s2">myths around the world the dragon for</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.960" end="00:48:03.650" style="s2">example is a very common symbol and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.700" end="00:48:05.090" style="s2">think the reason for that is it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.650" end="00:48:06.940" style="s2">complicated but I think the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.090" end="00:48:10.310" style="s2">that is something like this is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.940" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">human beings learned to understand over</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.310" end="00:48:15.290" style="s2">time that the most reliable leader was</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:17.120" style="s2">the person who could step outside the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.290" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">structure when it was damaged to</p>

<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:31.640" style="s2">mythological stories like the ANU malysh</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:34.010" style="s2">for example where the main hero Marduk</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.010" end="00:48:38.060" style="s2">characterized by this intense capacity</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.410" end="00:49:44.270" style="s2">and the other is the chaos that comes in</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.100" end="00:50:37.480" style="s2">is actually only king in so far as he</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.990" end="00:50:39.250" style="s2">can manifest that so in Mesopotamia your</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.480" end="00:50:41.170" style="s2">only Emperor if you were a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.250" end="00:50:43.900" style="s2">you&#39;d go out on New Year&#39;s Day and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.170" end="00:50:45.820" style="s2">reenact the entire cosmogony and you had</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.900" end="00:50:47.110" style="s2">to be a good representative of Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.820" end="00:50:49.270" style="s2">otherwise you didn&#39;t deserve your</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.110" end="00:50:52.090" style="s2">sovereignty and in Egypt unless you were</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.270" end="00:50:54.130" style="s2">a good avatar let&#39;s say of Horace and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.090" end="00:50:56.470" style="s2">Osiris the combination then you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.130" end="00:50:58.330" style="s2">get to be Pharaoh so you were embodying</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.470" end="00:51:01.240" style="s2">this principle this principle of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.330" end="00:51:03.460" style="s2">sovereignty and what happened in Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.240" end="00:51:05.020" style="s2">was that first of all the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.460" end="00:51:07.210" style="s2">sovereignty the images of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.020" end="00:51:09.550" style="s2">could only be used by the Pharaoh and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.210" end="00:51:11.530" style="s2">then it became the aristocracy and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.550" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">what seemed to happen after that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.530" end="00:51:13.690" style="s2">were using the symbols what seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:17.020" style="s2">happen after that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.690" end="00:51:18.910" style="s2">this was maybe a transmutation in part</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.020" end="00:51:20.980" style="s2">via the Greeks and in part via the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.910" end="00:51:24.760" style="s2">is that the idea that that&#39;s sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.980" end="00:51:26.560" style="s2">that was inherent in the Pharaoh and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.760" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">then in the aristocracy was actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.560" end="00:51:30.940" style="s2">something that could be attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:33.940" style="s2">everyone that was human and that was I</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.940" end="00:51:35.860" style="s2">think that that that manifested itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.940" end="00:51:37.750" style="s2">most completely in some sense at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.860" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">beginning of the Christian era because</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.750" end="00:51:41.950" style="s2">there was an emphasis then on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:44.440" style="s2">that every single individual carried</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.950" end="00:51:47.260" style="s2">within them a spark of the divine let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.440" end="00:51:49.240" style="s2">say and that was the proper source of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.260" end="00:51:51.010" style="s2">sovereignty and so then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.240" end="00:51:52.870" style="s2">well what is that source of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.010" end="00:51:55.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I read you that section</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.870" end="00:51:57.610" style="s2">from John to begin with because the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.570" end="00:52:00.850" style="s2">source of the divinity is the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.610" end="00:52:02.920" style="s2">to speak and transmute the world as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.850" end="00:52:04.780" style="s2">consequence of speaking and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.920" end="00:52:06.850" style="s2">proper principle of sovereignty and as</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.780" end="00:52:08.550" style="s2">far as I can tell it&#39;s also the reason</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.850" end="00:52:11.590" style="s2">why in the West people have an</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.550" end="00:52:13.180" style="s2">inviolable right the reason they have an</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.590" end="00:52:15.070" style="s2">inviolable right is because our society</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.180" end="00:52:17.910" style="s2">figured out and based on these</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.070" end="00:52:24.580" style="s2">unbelievably deep and decedent&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.910" end="00:52:26.500" style="s2">precedents that that each individual had</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.580" end="00:52:28.300" style="s2">the capacity to contribute something to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.500" end="00:52:31.300" style="s2">the group without which the group would</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.300" end="00:52:32.120" style="s2">be less it&#39;s something like that and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.300" end="00:52:34.130" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.120" end="00:52:37.490" style="s2">you&#39;re regarded at the base of our law</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.130" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">as the what as the avatar</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.490" end="00:52:40.940" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right as the avatar of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.340" style="s2">divine principle and that divine</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.940" end="00:52:45.710" style="s2">principle is the capacity to use your</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.340" end="00:52:47.930" style="s2">speech to give order to the chaos of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.710" end="00:52:49.370" style="s2">world and to criticize structures of</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.930" end="00:52:52.700" style="s2">order that have become corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.370" end="00:52:54.500" style="s2">reformulate them and so you you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.700" end="00:52:58.730" style="s2">this territory that surrounds you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.500" end="00:53:00.620" style="s2">in violet it&#39;s something about you that</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.730" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">transcends even the reach of the law</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.620" end="00:53:04.370" style="s2">which is a very strange thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">because in our society even if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.370" end="00:53:09.380" style="s2">murderer even if everyone knows it you</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:11.150" style="s2">still have inviolable rights but you</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.380" end="00:53:13.610" style="s2">think of all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.150" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">unlikely to have emerged as a concept</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.610" end="00:53:18.080" style="s2">that&#39;s got to be like number one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">been a very long long struggle for human</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.080" end="00:53:25.400" style="s2">beings to understand that we embody this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:27.380" style="s2">principle let&#39;s say that continually</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.400" end="00:53:29.420" style="s2">generates the world out of chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.380" end="00:53:32.270" style="s2">revitalizes it when it becomes corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.420" end="00:53:34.550" style="s2">and dead and that&#39;s the cut as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.270" end="00:53:36.530" style="s2">can tell that&#39;s what&#39;s expressed in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.550" end="00:53:39.080" style="s2">John is that there isn&#39;t any difference</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.530" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">between that and the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.080" end="00:53:43.910" style="s2">carefully articulate the nature of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">experience to other people and then to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.910" end="00:53:47.420" style="s2">respond to the corrective feedback</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:49.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.420" end="00:53:51.740" style="s2">progress through the world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.010" end="00:53:54.530" style="s2">the ultimate principle that should be at</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.740" end="00:53:56.860" style="s2">the top of what I think of as the set of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.530" end="00:54:00.190" style="s2">all human dominance hierarchies right</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.860" end="00:54:02.150" style="s2">something will move you up a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.190" end="00:54:03.590" style="s2">something slightly different will move</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.150" end="00:54:06.170" style="s2">you up a different hierarchy you take a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.590" end="00:54:08.180" style="s2">huge set of hierarchies and say well</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.170" end="00:54:10.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the principle that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.180" end="00:54:12.830" style="s2">work best over across all those</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.760" end="00:54:16.040" style="s2">hierarchies it&#39;s something like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.830" end="00:54:17.540" style="s2">capacity to speak the truth and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.040" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how it looks to me and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.540" end="00:54:21.140" style="s2">I think apart from the practical reasons</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:23.770" style="s2">that I already described I know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.140" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">tremendous amount of information to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.770" end="00:54:28.160" style="s2">process and my hope that made some sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:30.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a very difficult thing to boil down</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:31.910" style="s2">in a short period of time I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.530" end="00:54:34.360" style="s2">been trying to do that for like thirty</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.910" end="00:54:36.350" style="s2">years to get it coherent enough to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.360" end="00:54:38.750" style="s2">represent it in a short period of time</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.350" end="00:54:41.510" style="s2">but there&#39;s the practical issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:44.030" style="s2">that&#39;s how we encounter what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.510" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">understand and turn it into habitable</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.030" end="00:54:48.170" style="s2">space and how we communicate</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:50.119" style="s2">about it and reach consensus but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.170" end="00:54:52.730" style="s2">there&#39;s something much deeper underneath</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.119" end="00:54:55.099" style="s2">that which is that we know that and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.730" end="00:54:57.710" style="s2">know it really really deeply the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.099" end="00:54:59.510" style="s2">human race is being aiming at that for</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.710" end="00:55:01.160" style="s2">god only knows how long but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.510" end="00:55:02.900" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of years certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.160" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">and it might be far longer than that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.900" end="00:55:07.309" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not a principle that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:09.470" style="s2">dispense with and assume that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.309" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">construct something okay in this absence</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.470" end="00:55:14.089" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually an expression of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:16.010" style="s2">the fundamental nature of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.089" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">and we we mess with that are at our</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.010" end="00:55:22.869" style="s2">extreme peril and as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:25.690" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing now so</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.869" end="00:55:28.849" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.690" end="00:55:30.609" style="s2">objected to Bill c16 because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.849" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">think that it&#39;s reasonable for</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.609" end="00:55:36.049" style="s2">government authorities to put their</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:38.240" style="s2">goddamn words into their citizens mouths</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.049" end="00:55:40.220" style="s2">and as simple as that I think there</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.240" end="00:55:42.049" style="s2">isn&#39;t there&#39;s almost nothing you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.220" end="00:55:44.059" style="s2">embark on that would be more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.049" end="00:55:46.940" style="s2">than that and the fact that this had to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.059" end="00:55:48.890" style="s2">do with purportedly had to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.940" end="00:55:51.170" style="s2">rights of a small minority of people I</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.890" end="00:55:53.569" style="s2">think is a complete sideshow I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.170" end="00:55:55.940" style="s2">it&#39;s almost irrelevant in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.569" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">to the broader context and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.940" end="00:55:59.990" style="s2">if that wasn&#39;t the case then there</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:01.730" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been any furor whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.990" end="00:56:05.780" style="s2">about what I said because who the hell</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.730" end="00:56:09.619" style="s2">cares what I have to say so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.780" end="00:56:10.340" style="s2">that&#39;s my take on it so that&#39;s all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.619" end="00:56:20.050" style="s2">got to say</p>

<p begin="00:56:22.730" end="00:56:28.290" style="s2">so you mentioned the form of dialogue so</p>

<p begin="00:56:53.430" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">think sites like Facebook and not so</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.050" end="00:57:00.320" style="s2">much Twitter but basically Facebook</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.820" end="00:57:17.160" style="s2">what for you is lost I think it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.630" end="00:57:19.950" style="s2">of analogous to the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.160" end="00:57:21.660" style="s2">derivatives in the financial market you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.950" end="00:57:23.730" style="s2">know because like a derivative is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.660" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">something that can amplify the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.730" end="00:57:27.180" style="s2">which the market moves right because</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:29.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an abstraction from the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.180" end="00:57:31.770" style="s2">reality so it&#39;s more powerful for good</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.400" end="00:57:33.780" style="s2">and it&#39;s more powerful for evil and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.770" end="00:57:35.610" style="s2">would say so to speak you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.780" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">thinking about metaphorically well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.610" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">an amplifier and that can be a good</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:44.610" style="s2">thing but it can also be a bad thing and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:46.740" style="s2">I think it does often amplify the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.610" end="00:57:48.930" style="s2">proclivity of people to disappear into a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.740" end="00:57:51.450" style="s2">self-reflective bubble and that&#39;s aided</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.930" end="00:57:54.840" style="s2">by the algorithms that feed to you what</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.450" end="00:57:56.670" style="s2">you want to see so and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.840" end="00:57:58.320" style="s2">exactly what that&#39;s going to do it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.670" end="00:58:00.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a very dangerous thing because</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.320" end="00:58:02.490" style="s2">we&#39;re building an unconscious into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.840" end="00:58:04.770" style="s2">Internet and no one&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.490" end="00:58:06.420" style="s2">understand how it works because it gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.770" end="00:58:08.220" style="s2">more and more complex especially when</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.420" end="00:58:09.750" style="s2">any eye kicks in in a big way because</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.220" end="00:58:11.910" style="s2">you can&#39;t understand how those systems</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.750" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">work even though they work and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.910" end="00:58:15.510" style="s2">problem with that unconscious in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:17.340" style="s2">internet is it filters information and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.510" end="00:58:18.690" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what the filtering is</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.340" end="00:58:21.690" style="s2">maybe you don&#39;t know what your own</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.690" end="00:58:23.490" style="s2">filtering is you know because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.690" end="00:58:25.500" style="s2">conscious of your underlying processes</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.490" end="00:58:27.480" style="s2">but this adds a whole new dimension to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.500" end="00:58:30.090" style="s2">it and the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.480" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">self-fulfilling in some sense increases</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.090" end="00:58:38.670" style="s2">the probability of positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:41.100" style="s2">loops that will go out of control maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.670" end="00:58:42.900" style="s2">in your life because I&#39;m not a freak</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.250" end="00:59:31.230" style="s2">that&#39;s understandable because who wants</p>

<p begin="00:59:50.550" end="00:59:55.730" style="s2">more exposure to Facebook means more</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.310" end="01:00:03.420" style="s2">then in the political sphere you have</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.800" end="01:00:24.780" style="s2">incidentally I have a question that</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.240" end="01:00:31.410" style="s2">conversation you said how important it</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.580" end="01:00:34.380" style="s2">is for you as a speaker to get the</p>

<p begin="01:00:34.380" end="01:00:39.490" style="s2">grown up in East Germany we have learned</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.490" end="01:00:44.110" style="s2">no expression whatsoever it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.320" end="01:00:46.180" style="s2">outrageous stupid things because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.110" end="01:00:49.270" style="s2">consequences of like rolling your eyes</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.180" end="01:00:52.150" style="s2">when they were talking about us being</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.270" end="01:00:54.730" style="s2">well ahead economically of the West</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.150" end="01:00:57.820" style="s2">would be just very negative so we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.730" end="01:01:01.150" style="s2">do that and I see something very similar</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.820" end="01:01:04.300" style="s2">happening here in especially certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.150" end="01:01:06.820" style="s2">political lectures so if somebody tells</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.300" end="01:01:08.530" style="s2">you that what you are do or tells an</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.820" end="01:01:11.560" style="s2">audience what you are doing a solvable</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.530" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">and I&#39;m in that audience I wouldn&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.560" end="01:01:18.820" style="s2">my eyes unless I know what&#39;s that so the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">consequences are now of course in those</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.820" end="01:01:24.010" style="s2">are microaggressions yes yeah really I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:26.380" style="s2">not kidding you know it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.010" end="01:01:29.650" style="s2">it is yes I rolling in particulars is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.380" end="01:01:32.080" style="s2">sign of contempt exactly so but of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.650" end="01:01:34.900" style="s2">course if I if I never do that to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.080" end="01:01:37.540" style="s2">you now get the impression that what you</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.900" end="01:01:39.940" style="s2">say is just wonderful so you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.540" end="01:01:42.070" style="s2">the critical feedback that is as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.940" end="01:01:46.380" style="s2">pointed out lightly very important for</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.070" end="01:01:48.609" style="s2">you yes sir Klaus said goes both ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.380" end="01:01:51.010" style="s2">it&#39;s actually one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.609" end="01:01:52.960" style="s2">defenses of free speech is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.010" end="01:01:55.330" style="s2">deeply if you constrain it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.960" end="01:01:57.400" style="s2">depriving people of corrective feedback</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.330" end="01:02:00.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very bad thing because</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.400" end="01:02:03.730" style="s2">people people cannot maintain sanity in</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.670" end="01:02:06.420" style="s2">isolation you you outsource your sanity</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.730" end="01:02:09.310" style="s2">to other people if you&#39;re vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.420" end="01:02:11.290" style="s2">socially acceptable what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.310" end="01:02:13.540" style="s2">people can tolerate having you around</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.290" end="01:02:15.250" style="s2">and then they will provide you with</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.540" end="01:02:16.660" style="s2">corrective feedback and as long as you</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.250" end="01:02:18.700" style="s2">react to that you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.660" end="01:02:20.740" style="s2">about being sane because they&#39;ll keep</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.700" end="01:02:22.900" style="s2">you that way and you might think well no</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.740" end="01:02:26.530" style="s2">you can manage your sanity by yourself</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.900" end="01:02:29.410" style="s2">but no it&#39;s too complex you can&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.530" end="01:02:31.559" style="s2">not possible so the problem is not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.410" end="01:02:36.130" style="s2">and give it</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.559" end="01:02:38.289" style="s2">ultimately natural reaction</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.130" end="01:02:39.670" style="s2">absolutely while suddenness spontaneous</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.289" end="01:02:41.589" style="s2">reactions right because a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.670" end="01:02:43.479" style="s2">facial gestures those aren&#39;t those</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.589" end="01:02:44.969" style="s2">aren&#39;t precisely conscious and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.479" end="01:02:48.219" style="s2">actually good because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:02:54.009" end="01:02:57.219" style="s2">get all nervous it&#39;s like well you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.779" end="01:02:59.589" style="s2">trust that the dog doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.219" end="01:03:01.690" style="s2">agenda you know and people are like that</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.589" end="01:03:04.420" style="s2">in their initial responses too because</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.690" end="01:03:07.150" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re correct but at</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.420" end="01:03:09.969" style="s2">least it means that it&#39;s not mediated by</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.150" end="01:03:10.869" style="s2">like an ideological bias are not so</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.969" end="01:03:13.089" style="s2">straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.869" end="01:03:15.969" style="s2">just before we hear from eva i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.089" end="01:03:18.249" style="s2">mention that we let our hypothesis die</p>

<p begin="01:03:18.249" end="01:03:24.249" style="s2">favorite flower I first proper yes so</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.880" end="01:03:27.509" style="s2">just to talk a bit first of all I want</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.249" end="01:03:30.849" style="s2">to thank you for a most interesting</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.509" end="01:03:33.910" style="s2">presentation and on a line which a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.849" end="01:03:36.789" style="s2">of us here haven&#39;t heard before so I</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.910" end="01:03:39.009" style="s2">thank you for that and I&#39;ve did two</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.789" end="01:03:42.670" style="s2">things that I wanted to ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.009" end="01:03:46.329" style="s2">one the concept that you&#39;ve enunciated</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.670" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">of the emergence of an extremely long</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.329" end="01:03:52.839" style="s2">period of time of the idea that we all</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">have somewhat of the divine intervention</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.839" end="01:03:57.910" style="s2">I suppose also implies that we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:04:03.819" style="s2">somewhat of the opposite as well yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.910" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">also by that leads directly to the idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.819" end="01:04:09.849" style="s2">of individual rights versus group right</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">yes and a lot of the troubles that all</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.849" end="01:04:16.539" style="s2">of us here faced is that we have become</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">the target of these group demands for</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.539" end="01:04:24.549" style="s2">group types rather than individual</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:28.299" style="s2">rights at all attaining or not that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.549" end="01:04:30.729" style="s2">march towards the higher hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.299" end="01:04:33.190" style="s2">society based on our own efforts and our</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.729" end="01:04:35.170" style="s2">own performances and so on so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.190" end="01:04:37.239" style="s2">but that&#39;s also the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.170" end="01:04:39.130" style="s2">another thing that you raised which one</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.239" end="01:04:41.499" style="s2">really hears in any of these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.130" end="01:04:45.130" style="s2">meetings the biological basis of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.499" end="01:04:47.589" style="s2">behavior and I was really interested to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.130" end="01:04:50.109" style="s2">hear you bring this into the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.589" end="01:04:52.900" style="s2">because it is seemed to me over the</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.109" end="01:04:54.849" style="s2">years and I&#39;ve been around this business</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.900" end="01:04:58.299" style="s2">since the 60s I think when it all</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.849" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">struggles seem to have started if that a</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.299" end="01:05:02.859" style="s2">lot of the feminism nonsense is involved</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:07.599" style="s2">with the denial of differences between</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.859" end="01:05:09.549" style="s2">males and females a lot of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.599" end="01:05:10.599" style="s2">with the performance and affirmative</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.549" end="01:05:13.079" style="s2">action and so on</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.599" end="01:05:15.579" style="s2">if the denial that there may be</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.079" end="01:05:17.829" style="s2">biological basis to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.579" end="01:05:20.019" style="s2">performance differences that we see in</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.829" end="01:05:24.430" style="s2">various fields of activity around the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.019" end="01:05:25.989" style="s2">world and also this idea that we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.430" end="01:05:29.259" style="s2">decide what gender we are tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.989" end="01:05:31.059" style="s2">morning is edit III must have never</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.259" end="01:05:33.430" style="s2">heard of this so what did you call this</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.059" end="01:05:35.769" style="s2">the gender unicorn and I will say look</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.430" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">it up how when I go and the ice fairy</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.769" end="01:05:39.819" style="s2">instruction rolls and six-year-olds</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:42.700" style="s2">would be subjected to this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.819" end="01:05:46.779" style="s2">positively alarming so I just have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.700" end="01:05:48.880" style="s2">comment yeah well the they call that</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.779" end="01:05:51.160" style="s2">biological essentialism right and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.880" end="01:05:54.279" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a curse word</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.160" end="01:05:56.440" style="s2">essentially right it so and again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.279" end="01:05:58.529" style="s2">partly why I objected to the legislation</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.440" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">and surrounding policy because it</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.529" end="01:06:04.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t allow for a biological influence</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.079" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">and so which is preposterous in my</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.479" end="01:06:10.239" style="s2">estimation and I mean the biology</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">actually is much more useful than people</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.239" end="01:06:15.190" style="s2">even realize so you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:18.359" style="s2">things we were talking about earlier</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.190" end="01:06:20.799" style="s2">today was say the distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.359" end="01:06:24.609" style="s2">conservatives and liberals I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.799" end="01:06:26.619" style="s2">you one of the things that produces</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.609" end="01:06:28.059" style="s2">right-wing authoritarianism it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.619" end="01:06:30.549" style="s2">interesting and you wouldn&#39;t guess this</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.059" end="01:06:33.549" style="s2">in a million years prevalence of</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.549" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">infectious disease so there was a great</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.549" end="01:06:37.960" style="s2">paper published three years ago it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:40.509" style="s2">brilliant prevalence of infectious</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.960" end="01:06:43.299" style="s2">disease so it was published in a journal</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.509" end="01:06:45.549" style="s2">called plaus won and these researchers</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.299" end="01:06:47.589" style="s2">were interested in this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.549" end="01:06:49.719" style="s2">called the behavioural immune system and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.589" end="01:06:51.999" style="s2">so you know very frequently when</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.719" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">heretofore isolated human groups come</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.999" end="01:06:55.599" style="s2">into contact that</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.790" style="s2">either one group or the other dies like</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.599" end="01:06:59.260" style="s2">maybe maybe all of them or virtually all</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.790" end="01:07:00.550" style="s2">of them that&#39;s essentially what happened</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.260" end="01:07:02.710" style="s2">to the Native Americans when the</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.550" end="01:07:04.530" style="s2">Spaniards hit Central America right</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.710" end="01:07:07.750" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t have any built-in</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.530" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">immunity to smallpox or chickenpox or</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.750" end="01:07:12.339" style="s2">mumps or measles and like successive</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:13.869" style="s2">epidemics just wiped them out the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.339" end="01:07:19.210" style="s2">estimates vary but it could be as high</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.869" end="01:07:21.790" style="s2">as 95% and so it appears as though the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.210" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">the border idea the idea of thick</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.790" end="01:07:25.270" style="s2">borders let&#39;s say which is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:26.859" style="s2">fundamentally conservative idea the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.270" end="01:07:28.480" style="s2">liberals want open borders and lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.859" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">information flow and the Conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.480" end="01:07:33.070" style="s2">want close borders and more restriction</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:35.320" style="s2">and protection at every level of the of</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.070" end="01:07:36.820" style="s2">the conceptual hierarchy it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.320" end="01:07:38.890" style="s2">political borders its borders around</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.820" end="01:07:40.630" style="s2">everything but that seems to be tightly</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.890" end="01:07:42.849" style="s2">associated at least in part with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.630" end="01:07:44.770" style="s2">prevalence of infectious disease both at</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.849" end="01:07:46.510" style="s2">the country level and at the at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.770" end="01:07:48.849" style="s2">local level within countries and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.510" end="01:07:50.310" style="s2">correlations like 0.7 it&#39;s not trivial</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.849" end="01:07:52.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s not with governmental</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.310" end="01:07:55.000" style="s2">authoritarian attitudes it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.030" end="01:07:57.010" style="s2">individual authoritarian attitudes at in</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.000" end="01:07:59.020" style="s2">the locales where the infectious</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.010" end="01:08:00.700" style="s2">diseases are prevalent and it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.020" end="01:08:03.430" style="s2">be associated with the emotion of</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.700" end="01:08:05.170" style="s2">disgust so Hitler wasn&#39;t afraid of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.430" end="01:08:06.790" style="s2">Jews conservatives aren&#39;t afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.170" end="01:08:09.250" style="s2">others that isn&#39;t how it works</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.790" end="01:08:10.990" style="s2">they&#39;re disgusted that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.250" end="01:08:14.770" style="s2">thing it&#39;s associated with a personality</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.990" end="01:08:17.049" style="s2">trait called orderliness and so hit I</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.770" end="01:08:18.790" style="s2">read once this is being sorted out by</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.049" end="01:08:21.850" style="s2">psychologists over about the last 10</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.790" end="01:08:23.650" style="s2">years let&#39;s say and when I was plowing</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.850" end="01:08:25.000" style="s2">through the literature and working on</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.650" end="01:08:27.370" style="s2">the relationship between disgust</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.000" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">sensitivity and personality I happened</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.370" end="01:08:33.069" style="s2">to reread Hitler&#39;s table talk which was</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:36.130" style="s2">a collection of his spontaneous speeches</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.069" end="01:08:39.660" style="s2">collected at dinner time lunch times by</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.130" end="01:08:42.219" style="s2">secretaries from 1939 to 1940 two and</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.660" end="01:08:44.770" style="s2">one once I knew this other information</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.219" end="01:08:48.279" style="s2">just left out at me you know so Hitler</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.770" end="01:08:50.500" style="s2">was admirer of willpower that makes him</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.279" end="01:08:53.380" style="s2">a conscientious type of person very</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.500" end="01:08:57.339" style="s2">obsessed with order washed his hands</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.380" end="01:09:00.460" style="s2">continually was hyper clean and disgust</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.339" end="01:09:03.969" style="s2">sensitive and his primary metaphor for</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.460" end="01:09:07.150" style="s2">the German people was a body Arian body</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.969" end="01:09:10.449" style="s2">pure body under assault by Paris</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.449" end="01:09:14.589" style="s2">and it&#39;s mediated by disgust sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.519" end="01:09:16.779" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.589" end="01:09:18.579" style="s2">predicts that kind of right-wing close</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.779" end="01:09:20.769" style="s2">the border attitude and that&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.409" end="01:09:32.859" style="s2">everywhere to rid the world of it to the</p>

<p begin="01:10:05.050" end="01:10:08.380" style="s2">hierarchies is incredibly important I</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.610" end="01:10:11.079" style="s2">mean he&#39;s been looking at the emergence</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.380" end="01:10:12.699" style="s2">of proto morality among chimpanzees and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.079" end="01:10:14.739" style="s2">that seems to be driven in large part by</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.699" end="01:10:16.510" style="s2">the dominant hierarchy structure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.739" end="01:10:17.769" style="s2">not exactly a dominance hierarchy there</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.510" end="01:10:19.900" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not exactly the right</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.769" end="01:10:23.650" style="s2">way to think about because you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.900" end="01:10:25.090" style="s2">dominance implies pure power but lots of</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.650" end="01:10:26.380" style="s2">human hierarchies aren&#39;t dominance</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.090" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">hierarchies and all their competence</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.380" end="01:10:32.710" style="s2">hierarchies or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:36.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s very different I&#39;m a libertarian</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.710" end="01:10:38.079" style="s2">so I in favor of freedom but unlike a</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.250" end="01:10:41.619" style="s2">lot of libertarians I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.079" end="01:10:43.389" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a natural affinity to</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.619" end="01:10:46.230" style="s2">freedom among human beings that</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.389" end="01:10:47.920" style="s2">evolution has actually trained us to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.230" end="01:10:50.619" style="s2">conformists much more than</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:53.170" style="s2">freedom-loving individualist absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.619" end="01:10:54.849" style="s2">and and as a result of that I mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.170" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">because because in our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.849" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:11:01.510" style="s2">it was often much more important to roll</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:06.010" style="s2">all in the same direction the clan the</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.510" end="01:11:08.860" style="s2">roughly related genetically related</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.010" end="01:11:10.300" style="s2">clans that were roaming that it was much</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.860" end="01:11:11.829" style="s2">more important to row in the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.300" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">direction than to roll in the right</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.829" end="01:11:15.340" style="s2">direction as long as you didn&#39;t roll off</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:16.760" style="s2">the off the cliff or we&#39;re going to run</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.340" end="01:11:19.160" style="s2">off the cliff</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.760" end="01:11:21.320" style="s2">that would be as bad but but as long as</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.160" end="01:11:24.140" style="s2">you were muddling through it was better</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.320" end="01:11:27.350" style="s2">for everyone to be in the same and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.140" end="01:11:31.340" style="s2">therefore we evolved to be very much</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.350" end="01:11:32.870" style="s2">conformists and people like you and to</p>

<p begin="01:11:32.870" end="01:11:37.310" style="s2">are the disruptors we&#39;re the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.630" end="01:11:39.200" style="s2">are non conformists were the ones who</p>

<p begin="01:11:39.200" end="01:11:44.180" style="s2">right to me and and we&#39;re the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.090" end="01:11:45.590" style="s2">want to lead society back to chaos the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.180" end="01:11:48.200" style="s2">state of chaos where everyone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.590" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">their own little little view of how</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.200" end="01:11:51.080" style="s2">things should go instead of following</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">the leader and just doing what everyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.080" end="01:11:57.110" style="s2">else does and that&#39;s why people like you</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:59.450" style="s2">attract to meet to my way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.110" end="01:12:02.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why people like you attract such</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.450" end="01:12:04.970" style="s2">a visceral you know angry reaction is</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.840" end="01:12:07.370" style="s2">that you&#39;re leading us back into chaos</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.970" end="01:12:09.560" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t all ignore you and shut</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.370" end="01:12:12.860" style="s2">you down and you know we&#39;re all going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.560" end="01:12:14.900" style="s2">be you know in the state where the clan</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.860" end="01:12:17.120" style="s2">is fighting amongst each other instead</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.900" end="01:12:18.590" style="s2">of rolling in the same direction I mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.120" end="01:12:21.260" style="s2">I know if you have any thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.590" end="01:12:23.030" style="s2">well I think certainly one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.260" end="01:12:25.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve learned see I already knew before</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.030" end="01:12:27.380" style="s2">all this happened that people were</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.190" end="01:12:29.200" style="s2">primarily conforming I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.380" end="01:12:32.090" style="s2">have much of a problem with that because</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.200" end="01:12:35.600" style="s2">most of the time the tradition is</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.090" end="01:12:38.300" style="s2">correct but sometimes it&#39;s not correct</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.600" end="01:12:39.800" style="s2">at all that&#39;s the problem is that so you</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.300" end="01:12:41.600" style="s2">know one of the things I always tell my</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.800" end="01:12:44.470" style="s2">clients and my students for that matter</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.600" end="01:12:47.540" style="s2">is you should do what everyone else does</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.470" end="01:12:49.550" style="s2">unless you have a really good reason to</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.540" end="01:12:51.590" style="s2">vary and one of the things I learned</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.550" end="01:12:53.360" style="s2">from young Carl young was that and if</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.590" end="01:12:55.010" style="s2">you do vary you should try to only do it</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.360" end="01:12:56.510" style="s2">in a couple of directions because you</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.010" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">probably can&#39;t handle doing it more than</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.510" end="01:13:01.580" style="s2">that it&#39;s just too much - too much</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:03.200" style="s2">psychologically but you know the problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.580" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">is is that sometimes the group is</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.200" end="01:13:07.430" style="s2">rolling off a cliff and then it&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.840" end="01:13:09.740" style="s2">you know that&#39;s partly why the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.430" end="01:13:11.840" style="s2">individual in some sense is the eternal</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.740" end="01:13:14.930" style="s2">savior of the group because the group is</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:17.150" style="s2">it has the aspect of sheep let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.930" end="01:13:18.950" style="s2">the sheep are doing fine they&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.150" end="01:13:20.540" style="s2">whole herd thing going for them it</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.950" end="01:13:22.370" style="s2">decreases the risk of individual</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.540" end="01:13:24.230" style="s2">predation they&#39;ve got all their nervous</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.370" end="01:13:26.960" style="s2">systems in tune so there&#39;s real utility</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.230" end="01:13:28.580" style="s2">in the herd but they&#39;re also subject to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:30.030" style="s2">all the problems that herds have like</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.580" end="01:13:32.280" style="s2">herd panic</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.030" end="01:13:34.020" style="s2">and so so that&#39;s not good enough that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.280" end="01:13:35.310" style="s2">what human beings figured out was that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.020" end="01:13:37.140" style="s2">being part of the herd</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.310" end="01:13:40.020" style="s2">although necessary isn&#39;t good enough</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.140" end="01:13:43.470" style="s2">there has to be a balance between the</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.020" end="01:13:46.410" style="s2">tradition the old dead tradition and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.470" end="01:13:49.230" style="s2">revivifying force of the of the law of</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.410" end="01:13:51.030" style="s2">the living essentially that&#39;s those are</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.230" end="01:13:52.650" style="s2">actually how the God split up in need</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.030" end="01:13:54.750" style="s2">you because Horace was roughly a</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.650" end="01:13:56.580" style="s2">representation of the living and osiris</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.750" end="01:13:59.070" style="s2">was roughly a representation of the dead</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.580" end="01:14:00.570" style="s2">and it was the combined combination of</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.070" end="01:14:04.380" style="s2">those two that made up the sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.570" end="01:14:07.320" style="s2">very intelligent like dramatic political</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.380" end="01:14:09.210" style="s2">philosophy so but you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.320" end="01:14:12.150" style="s2">things I have seen since September is I</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.210" end="01:14:14.610" style="s2">mean I knew that people were conformist</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.150" end="01:14:17.370" style="s2">but I really had I really had no idea to</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.610" end="01:14:20.310" style="s2">what degree that was true you know like</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.370" end="01:14:22.200" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve got very very few letters of</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.310" end="01:14:24.960" style="s2">support from people who are academics</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.200" end="01:14:27.030" style="s2">for example and they I get secret</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:29.010" style="s2">reports really you know people come and</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.030" end="01:14:30.480" style="s2">say well we agree with what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.010" end="01:14:33.180" style="s2">but we wish you could be a little nicer</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.480" end="01:14:34.890" style="s2">about it which which you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.180" end="01:14:36.720" style="s2">funny thing for people to say because it</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.890" end="01:14:38.280" style="s2">implies that if they did what I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.720" end="01:14:40.680" style="s2">doing they would do a better job you</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.280" end="01:14:43.350" style="s2">know and which is fine but you know you</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.680" end="01:14:46.590" style="s2">can always try it out see how it goes so</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.350" end="01:14:48.240" style="s2">when I hate talks - on the climate</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.590" end="01:14:50.340" style="s2">definitely one of the most common</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.240" end="01:14:51.960" style="s2">comments I would get after the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.340" end="01:14:53.940" style="s2">over and people I find really around and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.960" end="01:14:56.460" style="s2">shaking amanda&#39;s I agree with everything</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.940" end="01:14:58.440" style="s2">you said that I would never yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.460" end="01:15:00.270" style="s2">well it&#39;s no wonder it&#39;s no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.440" end="01:15:02.100" style="s2">surprising you know I mean there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.270" end="01:15:05.910" style="s2">real reasons not to stick out from the</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.100" end="01:15:08.370" style="s2">herd if you if you mark a zebra so that</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.910" end="01:15:11.790" style="s2">you can identify it against the herd the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.370" end="01:15:13.980" style="s2">Lions will kill it right and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.790" end="01:15:16.230" style="s2">then I tell you knowing that you need to</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.980" end="01:15:17.490" style="s2">take this because they can&#39;t they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.230" end="01:15:21.420" style="s2">organize their hunt unless they can</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.490" end="01:15:23.280" style="s2">identify the individual that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.420" end="01:15:26.250" style="s2">well they&#39;re camouflaged against the</p>

<p begin="01:18:11.110" end="01:18:15.530" style="s2">you know I mean one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.850" end="01:18:18.590" style="s2">emerging right now although this is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.530" end="01:18:20.260" style="s2">fringe viewpoint is like imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.590" end="01:18:24.620" style="s2">you&#39;re dating</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.260" end="01:18:26.810" style="s2">well you&#39;re prejudiced because people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.620" end="01:18:29.000" style="s2">prejudices shine forth most clearly in</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.810" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">their choice of partners right they</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.000" end="01:18:35.150" style="s2">choose people who are sorry oh people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:38.690" style="s2">prejudices shine forth most brightly and</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.150" end="01:18:40.850" style="s2">their choice of of sexual partners right</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.690" end="01:18:43.730" style="s2">we prefer young people generally</p>

<p begin="01:18:53.210" end="01:18:57.230" style="s2">speaking and so though that&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.310" end="01:18:57.980" style="s2">prejudicial and one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.230" end="01:18:59.510" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.980" end="01:19:01.460" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say in the trans community</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.510" end="01:19:03.230" style="s2">because there isn&#39;t such a thing as far</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.460" end="01:19:05.720" style="s2">as I can tell but among certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.230" end="01:19:07.430" style="s2">individuals is their dubious of your</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.720" end="01:19:09.170" style="s2">right to choose your sexual partner</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.430" end="01:19:10.900" style="s2">based on their genitalia let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.170" end="01:19:14.120" style="s2">because that&#39;s a form of discrimination</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.900" end="01:19:16.640" style="s2">so yeah well you know look I could tell</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.120" end="01:19:18.800" style="s2">you in Huxley&#39;s brave new world and this</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.640" end="01:19:22.160" style="s2">is worth thinking about you didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.800" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">to it was it was a social faux pas to</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.160" end="01:19:26.120" style="s2">turn down a sexual request because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:27.350" style="s2">discriminatory it&#39;s like well it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.120" end="01:19:29.570" style="s2">discriminatory</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.350" end="01:19:31.970" style="s2">really I&#39;m not kidding man it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.570" end="01:19:33.980" style="s2">deepest form of discrimination you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.970" end="01:19:38.210" style="s2">you&#39;re basically saying you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.980" end="01:19:40.100" style="s2">saying yes exactly that&#39;s exactly it and</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.210" end="01:19:41.840" style="s2">that&#39;s what you had to do in Huxley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.100" end="01:19:43.690" style="s2">brave new world and you also weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.840" end="01:19:46.010" style="s2">allowed to have a long-term monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.690" end="01:19:47.390" style="s2">relationship because the exclusionary</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.010" end="01:19:50.690" style="s2">element of that was regarded as</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.390" end="01:19:53.570" style="s2">prejudicial which it is that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.690" end="01:19:56.540" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing and so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.570" end="01:19:58.790" style="s2">well I could say well I would I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.540" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">discriminate it&#39;s like well it depends</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.790" end="01:20:01.280" style="s2">on exactly</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:02.719" style="s2">what you mean by discriminate and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.280" end="01:20:04.580" style="s2">of course the argument is about exactly</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:07.130" style="s2">what right I have to discriminate and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.580" end="01:20:08.869" style="s2">increasingly the answer is none like</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.130" end="01:20:11.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve already sacrificed freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.869" end="01:20:13.310" style="s2">assembly we&#39;re pretty much on the way to</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.090" end="01:20:15.500" style="s2">sacrificing freedom of speech it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.310" end="01:20:17.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a logical conclusion to all of this</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.500" end="01:20:20.179" style="s2">that another issue they were very much</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.900" end="01:20:22.820" style="s2">on the same page I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.179" end="01:20:26.300" style="s2">psychology graduate yes what is your</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.820" end="01:20:28.670" style="s2">view of the authenticity that is some</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.300" end="01:20:30.320" style="s2">reason like I&#39;ve always identified the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.670" end="01:20:33.860" style="s2">opposite gender now a little much matter</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.320" end="01:20:35.360" style="s2">that I&#39;ve transitioned yes well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.860" end="01:20:36.770" style="s2">part that I&#39;m more skeptical about</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.360" end="01:20:38.420" style="s2">because the evidence isn&#39;t all that</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.770" end="01:20:41.630" style="s2">clear that people do feel better when</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.420" end="01:20:44.869" style="s2">they transition so but it&#39;s look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.630" end="01:20:47.000" style="s2">consumed yes it is first of all there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.869" end="01:20:49.159" style="s2">the fact that there are categories</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.000" end="01:20:51.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t exceptions</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.159" end="01:20:53.900" style="s2">okay there&#39;s exceptions now what those</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.679" end="01:20:55.489" style="s2">exceptions signify well that&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.900" end="01:20:57.710" style="s2">to be dealt with on an individual to</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.489" end="01:20:59.420" style="s2">individual basis and that&#39;s fine with me</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.710" end="01:21:01.429" style="s2">you know I&#39;m a clinician I&#39;ve dealt with</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.420" end="01:21:04.159" style="s2">all sorts of people who don&#39;t and who</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.429" end="01:21:06.530" style="s2">fits in the categories nobody like to</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.159" end="01:21:08.840" style="s2">become socialized what you do is you</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.530" end="01:21:10.969" style="s2">mangle your square peg into a round hole</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.840" end="01:21:13.520" style="s2">and I mean for some people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.969" end="01:21:15.619" style="s2">obviously far more of a sacrifice than</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.520" end="01:21:18.080" style="s2">for others but you know social being</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.619" end="01:21:20.690" style="s2">demands what would you call restriction</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.080" end="01:21:22.699" style="s2">of your at least of your individuality</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.690" end="01:21:24.260" style="s2">in all sorts of different aspects and</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.699" end="01:21:26.510" style="s2">for some people that&#39;s much more of a</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.260" end="01:21:29.179" style="s2">sacrifice than others the question is</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.510" end="01:21:32.270" style="s2">what does the existence of the exception</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.179" end="01:21:35.090" style="s2">imply for the general case and I believe</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.270" end="01:21:36.770" style="s2">that if you&#39;re a postmodernist and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.090" end="01:21:38.869" style="s2">Marxist underneath that it supplies the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.770" end="01:21:41.210" style="s2">excuse to take down the category of</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.869" end="01:21:43.040" style="s2">gender and why would you do that well</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.210" end="01:21:45.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a category used by the oppressive</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.040" end="01:21:47.659" style="s2">patriarchy to continue it&#39;s to continue</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.500" end="01:21:50.060" style="s2">its pathological power seeking</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.659" end="01:21:51.409" style="s2">distinction between you know leave me</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.060" end="01:21:54.590" style="s2">alone I want to get on with my life</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.409" end="01:21:56.810" style="s2">versus I&#39;m going to dismiss the category</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.590" end="01:21:59.090" style="s2">so that there&#39;s room for me yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.810" end="01:22:01.310" style="s2">precisely or I&#39;m going to dismiss the</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.090" end="01:22:03.170" style="s2">category on behalf of someone else who I</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.310" end="01:22:05.060" style="s2">claim to speak for which is even more</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.170" end="01:22:07.610" style="s2">commonly the case this is a general</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.060" end="01:22:08.970" style="s2">environment where oppression and</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.610" end="01:22:11.640" style="s2">identity are the currents</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.970" end="01:22:13.860" style="s2">status and advantage yes right right</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.640" end="01:22:16.530" style="s2">well I just don&#39;t see that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.860" end="01:22:18.630" style="s2">be all that useful kids are confused</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.530" end="01:22:21.180" style="s2">enough when they&#39;re growing up I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.630" end="01:22:23.580" style="s2">to add gender confusion to that which</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.180" end="01:22:26.340" style="s2">we&#39;re doing very very rapidly is going</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.580" end="01:22:29.310" style="s2">to destroy 15 people for every one it</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.340" end="01:22:30.870" style="s2">saves it might be more than that because</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.310" end="01:22:33.120" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of confused people out</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.870" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">there I would say like what two out of</p>

<p begin="01:22:56.640" end="01:23:02.280" style="s2">follow up on Grant Browns question</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.390" end="01:23:05.220" style="s2">Jordan is among that the top five or top</p>

<p begin="01:23:05.220" end="01:23:10.980" style="s2">the past year who&#39;s been a lightning rod</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.860" end="01:23:16.230" style="s2">a target of collective efforts at</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.980" end="01:23:18.810" style="s2">humiliation and being disgraced and my</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.230" end="01:23:21.390" style="s2">question is essentially if you could</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.810" end="01:23:24.660" style="s2">give as parsimonious an answer as you</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.390" end="01:23:31.740" style="s2">can which generally isn&#39;t very personal</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.660" end="01:23:35.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed yet of why you and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.740" end="01:23:36.840" style="s2">remarkable phenomenon when somebody is</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.070" end="01:23:39.780" style="s2">demonized to the extent that you have</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.840" end="01:23:43.440" style="s2">been in mainstream media I was reading</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.780" end="01:23:46.740" style="s2">just lately I picked up in a car</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.440" end="01:23:49.290" style="s2">mechanics office a copy of Toronto Life</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.740" end="01:23:53.130" style="s2">oh yeah there was this it did a nice job</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.290" end="01:23:55.230" style="s2">by by a kind of wide-eyed reporter who</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.130" end="01:23:57.540" style="s2">you know he doesn&#39;t seem like a demon</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.230" end="01:24:00.240" style="s2">you know he seems like a kind of nice</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.540" end="01:24:03.930" style="s2">guy he even seems a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.240" end="01:24:07.170" style="s2">left but he must be a deep and personal</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.930" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">so the question is just as briefly as</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.170" end="01:24:11.990" style="s2">you can why you because I said there was</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:15.530" style="s2">something I would do</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.990" end="01:24:18.300" style="s2">right I mean because like all these</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.530" end="01:24:21.270" style="s2">massive ideas as I said they manifest</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.300" end="01:24:22.230" style="s2">themselves in micro examples you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.270" end="01:24:24.060" style="s2">many my</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.230" end="01:24:26.489" style="s2">two examples but they&#39;re micro examples</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.060" end="01:24:29.040" style="s2">and so there&#39;s always a certain amount</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.489" end="01:24:31.950" style="s2">of arbitrariness when you decide to not</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.040" end="01:24:33.870" style="s2">go along with it and the arbitrariness</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.950" end="01:24:35.340" style="s2">is like well I said that I wouldn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.870" end="01:24:37.440" style="s2">these words for example and how to</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.340" end="01:24:39.930" style="s2">rationale for it and then people test</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.440" end="01:24:41.640" style="s2">you out when you when you put up your</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.930" end="01:24:43.380" style="s2">hand they test you out they think well</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.640" end="01:24:45.630" style="s2">are you just a monster well let&#39;s throw</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.380" end="01:24:47.460" style="s2">a bunch of monster words at you and see</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.630" end="01:24:48.840" style="s2">if they stick see if you can defend</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.460" end="01:24:50.040" style="s2">yourself because that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.840" end="01:24:51.960" style="s2">way of finding out whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.040" end="01:24:54.060" style="s2">actually a monster and so that was the</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.960" end="01:24:56.750" style="s2">first let&#39;s say two months of all of</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.060" end="01:24:59.700" style="s2">this was me just sort of fending off</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.750" end="01:25:02.640" style="s2">these different accusations now I was</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.700" end="01:25:05.640" style="s2">fortunate in many ways I was fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.640" end="01:25:10.230" style="s2">in that in the first demonstrations that</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.640" end="01:25:13.710" style="s2">followed the videos that the people who</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.230" end="01:25:15.810" style="s2">were supporting me behaved reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.710" end="01:25:18.150" style="s2">well compared to the people who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.810" end="01:25:20.489" style="s2">that was you could think about that as</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.150" end="01:25:22.050" style="s2">somewhat dependent on chance not</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.489" end="01:25:25.260" style="s2">entirely but things could have gone</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.050" end="01:25:27.210" style="s2">badly the other way and also I was</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.260" end="01:25:30.390" style="s2">protected by the fact that I already had</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.210" end="01:25:31.710" style="s2">about 400 hours of videos online and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.390" end="01:25:34.470" style="s2">virtually everything I had said to</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.710" end="01:25:36.540" style="s2">students in the last well over the span</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.470" end="01:25:38.550" style="s2">of 30 years really but particularly in</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.540" end="01:25:40.680" style="s2">the last five years was all recorded and</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.550" end="01:25:42.840" style="s2">so if anybody wanted to find out if I</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.680" end="01:25:44.580" style="s2">was a monster all they had to do is go</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.840" end="01:25:46.500" style="s2">through the painful process of listening</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.580" end="01:25:48.360" style="s2">to what I had to say and there were no</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.500" end="01:25:51.030" style="s2">smoking guns buried in there which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.360" end="01:25:53.460" style="s2">which is significant given that there</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.030" end="01:25:55.470" style="s2">were 200 hours of it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.460" end="01:25:56.910" style="s2">you&#39;d think there&#39;d be something in</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.470" end="01:25:58.620" style="s2">there that I said that could have been</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.910" end="01:26:01.380" style="s2">taken out of context that would have</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.620" end="01:26:04.800" style="s2">really walled me a good one but so far</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.380" end="01:26:08.010" style="s2">nobody seems to have extracted one so</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.800" end="01:26:08.850" style="s2">and I also think that I guess the next</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.010" end="01:26:11.340" style="s2">reason would be</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.850" end="01:26:13.350" style="s2">I didn&#39;t just apart from saying there</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.340" end="01:26:15.210" style="s2">was something specific I wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.350" end="01:26:17.489" style="s2">which like brings the abstraction down</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.210" end="01:26:20.550" style="s2">to a point of reality right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.489" end="01:26:22.830" style="s2">line that that makes it real rather than</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.550" end="01:26:23.880" style="s2">just an abstract critique I think the</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.830" end="01:26:26.310" style="s2">other thing that happened was that</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.880" end="01:26:27.960" style="s2">people came to my website because of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.310" end="01:26:29.430" style="s2">political material but that isn&#39;t where</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.960" end="01:26:31.260" style="s2">they stopped they started listening to</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.430" end="01:26:33.150" style="s2">what I had to say and I think that what</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.260" end="01:26:35.550" style="s2">I have to say is actually revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.150" end="01:26:35.880" style="s2">so and I think people have a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.550" end="01:26:37.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.880" end="01:26:39.780" style="s2">I mean it looks like it as far as I can</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.980" end="01:26:41.639" style="s2">tell the response seems to indicate that</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.780" end="01:26:44.610" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve shared some of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.639" end="01:26:46.400" style="s2">with you today that the idea that some</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.610" end="01:26:49.739" style="s2">of our values are grounded in in</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.400" end="01:26:51.870" style="s2">phenomena that are far more primordial</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.739" end="01:26:53.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say than our mere opinion like</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.870" end="01:26:55.949" style="s2">that&#39;s a big deal if it&#39;s if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.880" end="01:26:57.510" style="s2">anything about it that&#39;s true and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.949" end="01:27:00.989" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.510" end="01:27:03.719" style="s2">puzzle this out for a long time and it</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.989" end="01:27:05.580" style="s2">seems to cohere and when people try to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.719" end="01:27:07.679" style="s2">apply the principles that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.580" end="01:27:09.630" style="s2">discussing in their lives it makes their</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.679" end="01:27:11.190" style="s2">lives better you know and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.630" end="01:27:12.690" style="s2">interesting too because I&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.190" end="01:27:15.030" style="s2">around speaking publicly you know and</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.690" end="01:27:19.050" style="s2">most of my audiences man interestingly</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.030" end="01:27:21.330" style="s2">enough even in the live talks and all</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.050" end="01:27:23.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing with the men basically</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.330" end="01:27:25.020" style="s2">is talking to them about saying what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.070" end="01:27:26.580" style="s2">true and adopting responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.020" end="01:27:28.620" style="s2">they&#39;re so bloody hungry for that that</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.580" end="01:27:30.270" style="s2">it&#39;s just mind-boggling you know which</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.620" end="01:27:31.920" style="s2">is something really curious and</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.270" end="01:27:34.469" style="s2">interesting to me because that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.920" end="01:27:36.840" style="s2">saleable message you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.469" end="01:27:38.760" style="s2">because I&#39;m basically saying well find</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.840" end="01:27:40.500" style="s2">the heaviest load you can conceive of</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.760" end="01:27:42.389" style="s2">and try to pick it up and while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.500" end="01:27:44.610" style="s2">doing that you know try to engage in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.389" end="01:27:46.650" style="s2">least amount of deceit as possible and</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.610" end="01:27:48.600" style="s2">that that&#39;s also a pathway out of</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.650" end="01:27:51.170" style="s2">suffering you know for people in general</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.600" end="01:27:53.820" style="s2">well it&#39;s so interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.170" end="01:27:56.880" style="s2">unbelievably positively the people who</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.820" end="01:27:59.429" style="s2">who are following this are responding to</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.880" end="01:28:01.380" style="s2">they&#39;re responding to that it&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.429" end="01:28:03.330" style="s2">been talking to a lot of the potential</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.380" end="01:28:05.040" style="s2">leaders of the Conservative Party and</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.330" end="01:28:07.139" style="s2">you know one of the things I&#39;ve told</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.040" end="01:28:08.610" style="s2">them repeatedly is you guys have</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.139" end="01:28:10.170" style="s2">something to sell young people for the</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.610" end="01:28:12.600" style="s2">first time that I can remember and</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.170" end="01:28:14.310" style="s2">that&#39;s responsibility the left is</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.600" end="01:28:16.199" style="s2">selling freedom and rights it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.310" end="01:28:19.590" style="s2">well yeah where&#39;s the other half of this</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.199" end="01:28:21.330" style="s2">story freedom you know that&#39;s freedom to</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.590" end="01:28:24.570" style="s2">drown I mean I&#39;ve got nothing against</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.330" end="01:28:26.310" style="s2">freedom obviously but there&#39;s no rights</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.570" end="01:28:28.860" style="s2">without responsibilities and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.310" end="01:28:30.380" style="s2">freedom without tradition so somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.860" end="01:28:33.449" style="s2">got to tell the other half of this story</p>

<p begin="01:28:45.660" end="01:28:51.720" style="s2">conversation we had about a month ago</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.640" end="01:28:53.940" style="s2">yeah in a little cafe in Ottawa some of</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.720" end="01:28:58.410" style="s2">the issues we discussed then brought up</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.940" end="01:28:59.820" style="s2">again today it leads to certain we</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.410" end="01:29:02.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t resolve anything I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.820" end="01:29:04.830" style="s2">ultimately and I doubt if we ever will</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.070" end="01:29:06.630" style="s2">and it seems to me the real problem is</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.830" end="01:29:08.970" style="s2">something you mentioned today and we</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.630" end="01:29:10.770" style="s2">could go a little further with it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.970" end="01:29:12.660" style="s2">question that&#39;s Pontius Pilate question</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.770" end="01:29:16.230" style="s2">the first postmodernist what is truth</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.660" end="01:29:17.760" style="s2">and it was taken up many times but by</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.230" end="01:29:20.310" style="s2">Nietzsche and the genealogy of morals</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.760" end="01:29:21.600" style="s2">well truth this interpretation and of</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.310" end="01:29:23.310" style="s2">course this is not the case with</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.600" end="01:29:25.230" style="s2">Nietzsche and anybody who follows them</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.310" end="01:29:26.820" style="s2">as you pointed out because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.230" end="01:29:28.290" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s truth that there is no</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.820" end="01:29:30.510" style="s2">truth and therefore what do you do with</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.290" end="01:29:33.480" style="s2">that and you&#39;re into the problem of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.510" end="01:29:36.030" style="s2">Cretan liar but here is the problem for</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.480" end="01:29:38.370" style="s2">me even with your talk which is unusual</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.030" end="01:29:41.130" style="s2">brilliant and I think grounded in in</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.370" end="01:29:44.670" style="s2">tremendous amount of factual information</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.130" end="01:29:46.590" style="s2">I was asked once after a book of mine</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.670" end="01:29:49.140" style="s2">came out which was contested hotly by</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.590" end="01:29:50.970" style="s2">many people what gave me the right to</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.140" end="01:29:53.040" style="s2">think I had the truth this was an</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.970" end="01:29:56.370" style="s2">interviewer in Toronto for the Random</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.040" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">House thing and why did I think what I</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.370" end="01:30:01.290" style="s2">was saying was true who was I to say</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:04.080" style="s2">that I had the truth and I said I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.290" end="01:30:06.090" style="s2">have the truth I had to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.080" end="01:30:07.500" style="s2">some explanation quickly and some kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.090" end="01:30:09.570" style="s2">of phrasing it just occurred to me I</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.500" end="01:30:12.120" style="s2">said all I have is this credible</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.570" end="01:30:14.610" style="s2">verisimilitude what is credible</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.120" end="01:30:16.980" style="s2">verisimilitude he wanted to know I said</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.610" end="01:30:19.680" style="s2">eh it depends on gathering as much</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.980" end="01:30:21.750" style="s2">evidence as you possibly can even if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.680" end="01:30:23.790" style="s2">have to counter your own biases you just</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.750" end="01:30:27.150" style="s2">said with Leif at least the mouth of</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.790" end="01:30:30.300" style="s2">deceit or self-indulgence as possible</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.150" end="01:30:32.340" style="s2">and the second factor is common sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.300" end="01:30:35.070" style="s2">which seems to be not so common these</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.340" end="01:30:37.290" style="s2">days so if you can put evidence and</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.070" end="01:30:39.690" style="s2">common sense together and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.290" end="01:30:43.410" style="s2">time try and marshal and monitor your</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.690" end="01:30:45.030" style="s2">own proclivities I went right but that</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.410" end="01:30:47.790" style="s2">was hard with my book as I was left</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.030" end="01:30:49.500" style="s2">before I could go right and I had to</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.790" end="01:30:52.230" style="s2">make that decision do I want to go right</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.500" end="01:30:52.730" style="s2">and with all my friends or do I want to</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.230" end="01:30:55.430" style="s2">stay less</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.730" end="01:30:57.140" style="s2">you know have kept men and join my</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.430" end="01:30:58.640" style="s2">friends and socks I had to go right</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.140" end="01:31:01.760" style="s2">because that&#39;s where the evidence told</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.640" end="01:31:06.290" style="s2">me against my own desires so honesty if</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.760" end="01:31:07.880" style="s2">you can manage it evidence and common</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.290" end="01:31:11.300" style="s2">sense but here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.880" end="01:31:14.830" style="s2">truth it&#39;s still there how do you get</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.300" end="01:31:17.600" style="s2">from credible verisimilitude to truth</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.830" end="01:31:21.290" style="s2">where is the bridge how do you get there</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.600" end="01:31:23.480" style="s2">nobody can say that ultimately yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.290" end="01:31:24.860" style="s2">the problem I think you can you can say</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.480" end="01:31:26.510" style="s2">certain things are true soaring gains</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.860" end="01:31:27.860" style="s2">and tetris-like certain things have</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.510" end="01:31:30.500" style="s2">happened certain men have suffered as a</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.860" end="01:31:32.420" style="s2">result of feminists all this is true but</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.500" end="01:31:36.350" style="s2">where truth seems to founder is when you</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.420" end="01:31:40.130" style="s2">enter the realm of cause who has the</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.350" end="01:31:42.170" style="s2">truth to explain why feminism developed</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.130" end="01:31:44.270" style="s2">in the way it did or why climate warming</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.170" end="01:31:46.010" style="s2">or global warming developed in the way</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.270" end="01:31:47.540" style="s2">and it did we can point out the fact</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.010" end="01:31:49.570" style="s2">this is wrong the draught that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.540" end="01:31:53.720" style="s2">happening but when you get out of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.570" end="01:31:57.320" style="s2">elements the region of events and into</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.720" end="01:31:59.000" style="s2">the region of the causes that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.320" end="01:32:01.610" style="s2">bridge the gap from credible</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.000" end="01:32:04.489" style="s2">verisimilitude to truth and i frankly</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.610" end="01:32:06.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to manage that so the</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.489" end="01:32:08.090" style="s2">conclusion i&#39;m coming to is a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.410" end="01:32:10.160" style="s2">different from your conclusion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.090" end="01:32:11.989" style="s2">the one that i want to come to and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.160" end="01:32:13.730" style="s2">would like to resist it but the</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.989" end="01:32:16.450" style="s2">conclusion I&#39;m coming to is quite simply</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.730" end="01:32:18.890" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.450" end="01:32:20.840" style="s2">yes but that&#39;s always being true right</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.890" end="01:32:22.820" style="s2">says the apocalypse is always that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.840" end="01:32:24.320" style="s2">the apocalypse is eternal because the</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.820" end="01:32:27.080" style="s2">world is always coming to an end and</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.320" end="01:32:31.220" style="s2">it&#39;s actually true in small ways and in</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.080" end="01:32:33.710" style="s2">great ways I mean with regards to to</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.220" end="01:32:37.160" style="s2">your your ideas about truth I would say</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.710" end="01:32:41.150" style="s2">that like language truth is more like a</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.160" end="01:32:43.100" style="s2">process and I would say it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.150" end="01:32:46.580" style="s2">process that you actually embody rather</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.100" end="01:32:48.020" style="s2">than conceptualize abstractly to one of</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.580" end="01:32:50.540" style="s2">the ways I&#39;ve thought about it is that</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.020" end="01:32:52.220" style="s2">if you&#39;re seeking the truth and what you</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.540" end="01:32:54.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know is more important to you than</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.220" end="01:32:56.900" style="s2">what you know and that&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.400" end="01:32:59.239" style="s2">orientation right I mean what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.900" end="01:33:00.860" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been doing since September and</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.239" end="01:33:02.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve had friends have been helping me</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.860" end="01:33:03.560" style="s2">with this but I think I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.090" end="01:33:05.930" style="s2">this for a long time as I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.560" end="01:33:06.679" style="s2">figure out where I&#39;m wrong I&#39;m watching</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.930" end="01:33:07.969" style="s2">the audience too</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.679" end="01:33:09.380" style="s2">see if I&#39;m making a mistake i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.969" end="01:33:11.150" style="s2">listening to my friends who are watching</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.380" end="01:33:13.909" style="s2">my youtube videos telling me what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.150" end="01:33:16.729" style="s2">little too angry maybe or maybe too</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.909" end="01:33:18.320" style="s2">pompous or too noisy or you know all the</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.729" end="01:33:19.820" style="s2">different ways that you can fail in</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.320" end="01:33:20.150" style="s2">front of an audience i&#39;m listening to</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.820" end="01:33:22.249" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.150" end="01:33:24.829" style="s2">i&#39;m listening to the comments and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.249" end="01:33:27.199" style="s2">trying to modify myself accordingly you</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.829" end="01:33:28.610" style="s2">know and so you live in error and strive</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.199" end="01:33:30.349" style="s2">towards the truth and it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.610" end="01:33:32.389" style="s2">striving that the truth is most</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.349" end="01:33:33.889" style="s2">accurately embodied but then I would</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.389" end="01:33:35.929" style="s2">also say one other thing and this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.889" end="01:33:37.909" style="s2">what I like about the existentialists is</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.929" end="01:33:40.039" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.909" end="01:33:41.929" style="s2">emphasis on pragmatic truth among the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.039" end="01:33:43.639" style="s2">existentialists because they claim that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.929" end="01:33:47.179" style="s2">your truth is something that you should</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.639" end="01:33:49.639" style="s2">act out not merely hold because to act</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.179" end="01:33:51.739" style="s2">out is to believe it it&#39;s a definition</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.639" end="01:33:54.519" style="s2">right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not precisely a</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.739" end="01:33:57.469" style="s2">proposition it&#39;s a definition and so I</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.519" end="01:34:01.610" style="s2">found some things that I was confident</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.469" end="01:34:03.889" style="s2">and enough in to risk acting out and so</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.610" end="01:34:05.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing to the best of my</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.889" end="01:34:07.369" style="s2">ability and then I&#39;m watching what</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.360" end="01:34:08.929" style="s2">happens and and I&#39;m watching what</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.369" end="01:34:12.709" style="s2">happens if other people act out the</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.929" end="01:34:17.300" style="s2">propositions and as far as I can tell so</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.709" end="01:34:20.019" style="s2">far so good I mean I I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.300" end="01:34:22.579" style="s2">say that my position right now is to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.019" end="01:34:25.010" style="s2">what would you envied it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.579" end="01:34:28.670" style="s2">stressful I mean since September I</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.010" end="01:34:31.880" style="s2">basically be in the position of any</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.670" end="01:34:33.800" style="s2">mistake is fatal for all intents and</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.880" end="01:34:36.579" style="s2">purposes you know and that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.800" end="01:34:40.969" style="s2">stressful to be that hyper vigilant and</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.579" end="01:34:42.380" style="s2">but by the same token the public</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.969" end="01:34:43.849" style="s2">responds to what I&#39;ve been doing has</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.380" end="01:34:45.459" style="s2">been overwhelmingly positive you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.849" end="01:34:48.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve only got three pieces of hate mail</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.459" end="01:34:50.209" style="s2">which which just staggers me you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.139" end="01:34:53.570" style="s2">and and the comments on YouTube for</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.209" end="01:34:55.639" style="s2">example are like 50 to 1 positive and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.570" end="01:35:02.570" style="s2">mean who yeah maybe it&#39;s a biased sample</p>

<p begin="01:35:02.570" end="01:35:05.539" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been trying to rip holes</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.800" end="01:35:07.429" style="s2">in the ideas that I&#39;ve presented to you</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.539" end="01:35:09.439" style="s2">today for really like with all my</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.429" end="01:35:11.179" style="s2">intellectual capability for as long</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.439" end="01:35:13.099" style="s2">everytime a lecture I&#39;m trying to do the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.179" end="01:35:15.079" style="s2">same thing is like is there something in</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.099" end="01:35:16.309" style="s2">this that I haven&#39;t got right because</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.079" end="01:35:18.979" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to I was trying to look for</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.309" end="01:35:19.349" style="s2">some a rock at the bottom of things you</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.979" end="01:35:21.989" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.349" end="01:35:23.669" style="s2">and partly why I decided that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.989" end="01:35:25.499" style="s2">going to use those damn words is because</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.669" end="01:35:28.379" style="s2">I think the rock at the bottom of things</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.499" end="01:35:33.659" style="s2">is honest speech I really believe that</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.379" end="01:35:34.260" style="s2">it seems to me to be right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.659" end="01:35:36.149" style="s2">good enough</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.260" end="01:35:38.099" style="s2">so I&#39;ll act it out and see what happens</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.149" end="01:35:40.649" style="s2">as best I can I mean I&#39;m not claiming to</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.099" end="01:35:42.179" style="s2">be I&#39;m not claiming to be any more</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.649" end="01:35:44.550" style="s2">honest than anyone else you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.179" end="01:35:46.409" style="s2">seriously I&#39;m not I did that what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.550" end="01:35:47.969" style="s2">a big claim to make you better watch</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.409" end="01:35:50.099" style="s2">your bloody step if you&#39;re going to say</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.969" end="01:35:53.219" style="s2">that but that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.099" end="01:35:55.499" style="s2">believe that on speech is the pathway to</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.219" end="01:35:59.249" style="s2">redemption because I do believe that so</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.499" end="01:36:01.289" style="s2">I know that strange language but you</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.249" end="01:36:02.969" style="s2">know that&#39;s still it&#39;s the most accurate</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.289" end="01:36:11.729" style="s2">language for that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.969" end="01:36:14.489" style="s2">conceptualization so during your</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.729" end="01:36:20.879" style="s2">presentation your ear emphasis has</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.489" end="01:36:24.989" style="s2">always been on the truth I mean the man</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.879" end="01:36:30.599" style="s2">who strays from the group to find the</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.989" end="01:36:32.849" style="s2">truth and comes back to it etc oh all</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.599" end="01:36:37.949" style="s2">right his emphasis has been throughout</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.849" end="01:36:40.260" style="s2">on truth and my question is this I take</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.949" end="01:36:43.229" style="s2">it that truth is a necessary condition</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.260" end="01:36:45.599" style="s2">for an idea being important at some</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.229" end="01:36:47.909" style="s2">level it&#39;s not at all obvious that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.599" end="01:36:50.479" style="s2">a sufficient condition I mean some</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.909" end="01:36:55.769" style="s2">truths are surely uninteresting boring</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.479" end="01:36:59.399" style="s2">and others are really important and in</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.769" end="01:37:01.550" style="s2">particular ideas about value I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.399" end="01:37:04.739" style="s2">sure whether you wanted to classify</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.550" end="01:37:07.139" style="s2">claims above value as being susceptible</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.739" end="01:37:09.899" style="s2">or truth or falsity that&#39;s sort of been</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.139" end="01:37:12.780" style="s2">a long-standing you know question in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.899" end="01:37:15.149" style="s2">philosophical world but but which is the</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.780" end="01:37:18.510" style="s2">right thing to say about those let&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.149" end="01:37:22.289" style="s2">we suppose that we include those it</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.510" end="01:37:25.679" style="s2">would be a way of obscuring the contrast</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.289" end="01:37:29.309" style="s2">I&#39;m going to make which is surely we</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.679" end="01:37:31.020" style="s2">need an additional variable which is the</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.309" end="01:37:34.650" style="s2">value of these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.020" end="01:37:37.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s not I was wondering whether you</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.650" end="01:37:40.350" style="s2">were in we&#39;re supposing that you had at</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.980" end="01:37:42.930" style="s2">least implicitly some kind of general</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.350" end="01:37:45.240" style="s2">criterion of value of that kind that</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.930" end="01:37:47.630" style="s2">applies in your theory yeah or whether</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.240" end="01:37:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s open-ended no I have a criteria</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.630" end="01:37:51.060" style="s2">because it didn&#39;t mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.440" end="01:37:52.770" style="s2">fundamental question and I know I am</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.060" end="01:37:55.050" style="s2">talking about values rather than</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.770" end="01:37:57.840" style="s2">empirical facts of which there are an</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.050" end="01:37:59.670" style="s2">infinity right and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.840" end="01:38:01.770" style="s2">application of the facts to the problems</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.670" end="01:38:04.560" style="s2">of life that&#39;s the that&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.770" end="01:38:06.540" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of facts but I</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.560" end="01:38:08.670" style="s2">would say and I got this partly from</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.540" end="01:38:10.590" style="s2">Piaget because CPA one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.670" end="01:38:12.360" style="s2">that John Piaget was trying to do was to</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.590" end="01:38:13.890" style="s2">understand he was actually trying to</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.360" end="01:38:15.120" style="s2">mediate between religion and science</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.890" end="01:38:18.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what drove his entire</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.120" end="01:38:20.460" style="s2">intellectual career and he came up with</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.210" end="01:38:23.580" style="s2">this idea of the equilibrate state which</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.460" end="01:38:26.100" style="s2">is an idea I really like so imagine two</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.580" end="01:38:28.860" style="s2">teams of five people pursuing a goal</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.100" end="01:38:33.810" style="s2">it&#39;s the same goal for both teams but</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.860" end="01:38:36.180" style="s2">team a has been forcibly compelled to</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.810" end="01:38:39.060" style="s2">attain the goal and Team B is doing it</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.180" end="01:38:41.820" style="s2">voluntarily his proposition was is that</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.060" end="01:38:43.980" style="s2">in a in an even in a race that was even</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.820" end="01:38:45.600" style="s2">all other things considered that the</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.980" end="01:38:47.340" style="s2">team that was composed of voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.600" end="01:38:49.440" style="s2">participants would outperform the team</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.340" end="01:38:51.390" style="s2">that was compelled and I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.440" end="01:38:52.830" style="s2">Ben and he he basically said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.390" end="01:38:54.750" style="s2">enforcement costs that make the</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.830" end="01:38:56.820" style="s2">difference and that&#39;s a compelling</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.750" end="01:38:59.040" style="s2">argument for me and so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.820" end="01:39:01.830" style="s2">expanding on that partly it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.040" end="01:39:04.770" style="s2">Piaget via Jung I would say is the</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.830" end="01:39:07.500" style="s2">intellectual pathway it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.770" end="01:39:11.550" style="s2">proper aim for value is something like</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.500" end="01:39:14.580" style="s2">what&#39;s good for me in a way that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.550" end="01:39:16.590" style="s2">for me tomorrow and next week next month</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.580" end="01:39:19.650" style="s2">the next year because timeframe matters</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.590" end="01:39:21.750" style="s2">a lot so that&#39;s a serious constraint and</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.650" end="01:39:24.030" style="s2">then what&#39;s good for me now in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.750" end="01:39:26.190" style="s2">future me in a way that&#39;s also good for</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.030" end="01:39:28.620" style="s2">the other people around me if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.190" end="01:39:31.050" style="s2">possible and then also broader society</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.620" end="01:39:32.790" style="s2">if that&#39;s possible across multiple time</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.050" end="01:39:35.700" style="s2">frames that&#39;s sort of like the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.790" end="01:39:38.580" style="s2">equilibrated state and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.700" end="01:39:39.870" style="s2">hypothetical ideal obviously but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.580" end="01:39:43.290" style="s2">sure that answers</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.870" end="01:39:47.010" style="s2">question in the following way why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.290" end="01:39:49.110" style="s2">you be is an indefinite number of things</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.010" end="01:39:51.960" style="s2">were dark which are good why is that</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.110" end="01:39:55.560" style="s2">same criterion but different lots of</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.960" end="01:39:57.510" style="s2">them we don&#39;t it seems to me in a way</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.560" end="01:40:00.840" style="s2">that sort of single criterion of</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.510" end="01:40:02.640" style="s2">anything why do you think that well I</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.840" end="01:40:05.610" style="s2">know but I think there is because in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.640" end="01:40:07.290" style="s2">silver down yeah it&#39;s measured but it</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.610" end="01:40:10.800" style="s2">seems you just leave the whole lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.290" end="01:40:12.600" style="s2">in and and that&#39;s interesting and I</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.800" end="01:40:15.390" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good thing my stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.600" end="01:40:16.380" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s not obvious that that</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.390" end="01:40:18.360" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be true</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.380" end="01:40:21.750" style="s2">I think there&#39;s commonalities among the</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.360" end="01:40:23.310" style="s2">set of solutions that&#39;s basically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.750" end="01:40:25.140" style="s2">the proposition that I&#39;m putting forward</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.310" end="01:40:27.780" style="s2">is that there are and I think those</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.140" end="01:40:29.520" style="s2">would be akin to Jung&#39;s archetypes their</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.780" end="01:40:32.100" style="s2">commonalities across the sets of</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.520" end="01:40:34.380" style="s2">solutions and so in their reflective of</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.100" end="01:40:36.420" style="s2">people&#39;s I would say basic nature</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.380" end="01:40:39.210" style="s2">roughly speaking I mean it&#39;s partly why</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.420" end="01:40:41.460" style="s2">human beings that are isolated and have</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.210" end="01:40:43.950" style="s2">been forever can learn to trade with one</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.460" end="01:40:46.830" style="s2">another for example because they can and</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.950" end="01:40:49.950" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s there are constraints</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.830" end="01:40:52.290" style="s2">built into that requirement that I just</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.950" end="01:40:54.390" style="s2">described that weed out most solutions</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.290" end="01:40:56.790" style="s2">which is also I think the answer to the</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.390" end="01:40:58.230" style="s2">postmodern dilemma which is well because</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.790" end="01:40:59.220" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of posing it which is well</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.230" end="01:41:01.350" style="s2">how do you know there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.220" end="01:41:05.370" style="s2">indefinite number of solutions and I</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.350" end="01:41:07.380" style="s2">would say because the the constraints on</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.370" end="01:41:11.370" style="s2">the solution space are so intense that</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.380" end="01:41:13.290" style="s2">very few variants manage because if you</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.370" end="01:41:15.030" style="s2">make a big mistake you&#39;re dead or people</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.290" end="01:41:16.680" style="s2">or people gang up on you or like you</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.030" end="01:41:20.070" style="s2">know you either run into the world</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.680" end="01:41:22.230" style="s2">headlong and perish or you transgress</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.070" end="01:41:24.750" style="s2">against your fellow people and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.230" end="01:41:26.400" style="s2">not very happy about that and so the set</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.750" end="01:41:29.850" style="s2">of solutions that allows you to</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.400" end="01:41:31.740" style="s2">simultaneously exist in the world and in</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.850" end="01:41:34.350" style="s2">the social world for a reasonable length</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.740" end="01:41:36.240" style="s2">of time there it&#39;s I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.350" end="01:41:37.780" style="s2">very limited number of solutions to that</p>

<p begin="01:41:37.780" end="01:41:45.280" style="s2">this used to be that year which it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.840" end="01:41:48.610" style="s2">constraining the set up the set of</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.280" end="01:41:51.850" style="s2">things in your universe in a way that to</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.610" end="01:41:54.580" style="s2">be much to used excluding lots of images</p>

<p begin="01:41:54.580" end="01:42:01.360" style="s2">influenced us but that fits us well I</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.080" end="01:42:04.150" style="s2">mean the only thing I can say is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.360" end="01:42:06.580" style="s2">that I think there are there&#39;s a set of</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.150" end="01:42:08.620" style="s2">solutions that&#39;s bounded in some manner</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.580" end="01:42:11.020" style="s2">even though it may be quite large but</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.620" end="01:42:13.150" style="s2">there&#39;s still a pattern to be detected</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.020" end="01:42:15.190" style="s2">among its like it&#39;s like the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.150" end="01:42:17.830" style="s2">that you can detect that unites</p>

<p begin="01:42:17.830" end="01:42:21.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something although there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.420" end="01:42:23.740" style="s2">diverse forms of music there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.400" end="01:42:25.600" style="s2">that emerges from all those forms that</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.740" end="01:42:26.970" style="s2">allows you to generate the category and</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.600" end="01:42:29.620" style="s2">I think the same is the case with</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.970" end="01:42:31.210" style="s2">ethical behavior although even though</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.620" end="01:42:35.050" style="s2">it&#39;s subject to the constraints of time</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.210" end="01:42:37.390" style="s2">and place as well so well thank you very</p>

<p begin="01:42:39.010" end="01:42:43.030" style="s2">end with some encouragement first of all</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.080" end="01:42:44.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve looked at the extent of your</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.030" end="01:42:46.960" style="s2">coverage on YouTube and one of my areas</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.800" end="01:42:48.520" style="s2">is digital media and journalism and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.960" end="01:42:51.430" style="s2">incredibly impressive as you probably</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.520" end="01:42:53.950" style="s2">already know so the level of influence</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.430" end="01:42:55.840" style="s2">that you have is really incredible and</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.950" end="01:42:57.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing because that brings</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.840" end="01:42:59.770" style="s2">me to my second point I&#39;ve watched a lot</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.670" end="01:43:02.440" style="s2">of your stuff and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.770" end="01:43:04.930" style="s2">embarrassing for those of us who hold</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.440" end="01:43:07.630" style="s2">similar views greatly great that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.930" end="01:43:09.580" style="s2">in that in the next slide I am</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.630" end="01:43:11.740" style="s2">definitely anything like hearing you in</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.580" end="01:43:14.380" style="s2">fact I mean there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.740" end="01:43:16.540" style="s2">who espouse similar views and and they</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.380" end="01:43:17.800" style="s2">give me shivers they make me sick to my</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.540" end="01:43:21.910" style="s2">stomach a bit but you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.800" end="01:43:23.710" style="s2">embarrassed us me and and that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.910" end="01:43:26.950" style="s2">and secondly I&#39;ve seen that you have</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.710" end="01:43:28.270" style="s2">moderated even your approach as I mean</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.950" end="01:43:31.570" style="s2">saying the same things but you&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.270" end="01:43:34.060" style="s2">even more erudite in the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.570" end="01:43:35.530" style="s2">present your arguments and and I really</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.060" end="01:43:37.900" style="s2">appreciate the effort that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.530" end="01:43:39.940" style="s2">putting into this because the number of</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.900" end="01:43:41.530" style="s2">places that you&#39;ve been and and the</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.940" end="01:43:44.770" style="s2">number of shows that you&#39;ve appeared on</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.530" end="01:43:47.170" style="s2">I know must be very tax taxing and so I</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.770" end="01:43:50.290" style="s2">want to just acknowledge that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.170" end="01:43:51.640" style="s2">doing this not for your own good and I</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.290" end="01:43:53.500" style="s2">really appreciate the eff</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.640" end="01:43:56.320" style="s2">that you&#39;re putting into this because</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.500" end="01:43:58.240" style="s2">this is a lot of personal effort that</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.320" end="01:44:05.410" style="s2">you&#39;ve expended and I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.240" end="01:44:07.210" style="s2">it thank you yeah and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.410" end="01:44:09.100" style="s2">question the question is I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.210" end="01:44:11.380" style="s2">sorry everyone but the question is this</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.100" end="01:44:13.000" style="s2">I keep hearing people say if these are</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.380" end="01:44:15.760" style="s2">my colleagues who are cowards</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.000" end="01:44:17.110" style="s2">incidentally who say if only he were</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.760" end="01:44:19.660" style="s2">nicer mmm</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.110" end="01:44:21.490" style="s2">and you&#39;ve mentioned that already do you</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.660" end="01:44:23.590" style="s2">really think that and honestly this is</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.490" end="01:44:25.270" style="s2">the question then do we need to be nicer</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.590" end="01:44:27.310" style="s2">do you need to be nicer</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.270" end="01:44:31.120" style="s2">what really need just the response to</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.310" end="01:44:33.190" style="s2">that if you would I need to be nicer</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.120" end="01:44:35.500" style="s2">when it&#39;s necessary to be nice and not</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.190" end="01:44:37.870" style="s2">nicer when it isn&#39;t and I need to learn</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.500" end="01:44:39.780" style="s2">to distinguish those more carefully</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.870" end="01:44:41.650" style="s2">continually more carefully and</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.780" end="01:44:44.770" style="s2">hypothetically I&#39;m getting better at it</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.650" end="01:44:46.900" style="s2">the fact that my job isn&#39;t at stake at</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.770" end="01:44:49.240" style="s2">the moment actually does take some of</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.900" end="01:44:51.640" style="s2">the agitation pressure off you know I</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.240" end="01:44:55.800" style="s2">mean at the beginning of this I was</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.640" end="01:45:02.230" style="s2">quite embattled let&#39;s say and also less</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.800" end="01:45:04.420" style="s2">a accustomed to this crazy sequence of</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.230" end="01:45:06.280" style="s2">events and so you know I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.420" end="01:45:09.610" style="s2">exactly what I was doing not that I do</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.280" end="01:45:11.860" style="s2">now but I&#39;m and I&#39;m more resigned to it</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.610" end="01:45:14.890" style="s2">in some sense as well and I&#39;m not trying</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.860" end="01:45:16.750" style="s2">to present myself as you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.890" end="01:45:18.010" style="s2">regard what&#39;s happened to me as any sort</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.750" end="01:45:21.670" style="s2">of calamity even though it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.010" end="01:45:26.500" style="s2">complicated but it has its own momentum</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.670" end="01:45:31.330" style="s2">and and I&#39;m that&#39;s okay I guess but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.500" end="01:45:33.940" style="s2">trying to weave my way through this with</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.330" end="01:45:36.010" style="s2">the least amount of enmity possible</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.940" end="01:45:40.450" style="s2">right but that&#39;s something you have to</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.010" end="01:45:43.310" style="s2">continually feel out and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.450" end="01:45:53.169" style="s2">that&#39;s working better that&#39;s the plan</p>
