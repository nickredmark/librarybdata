<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:16.410" style="s2">podcast this is the Q &amp; A with Yuri</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.530" end="00:00:18.300" style="s2">Dagon who many of you hopefully most of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">you have seen on my original discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">with him about the lab leak hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">for the origin of SARS Cove - the cause</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">of the kovat nineteen pandemic our plan</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">here is to have you give us questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">super chat questions will be prioritized</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for high quality questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:43.920" style="s2">and questions only related to the topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">in our discussion of the lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">hypothesis so you can ask us about other</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">things mentioned there but no general</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">questions if you would URI welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">the Dark Horse podcast again a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2">people were fascinated by our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">and I think it is having an effect in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:07.369" style="s2">the world people are waking up to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">idea that they cannot just simply</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.369" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">dismiss this hypothesis no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">much that is their desire it&#39;s great in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">the world yeah I would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">on the other hand I would say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:33.180" style="s2">think the two are unrelated and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">of that we cannot afford to focus in one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.180" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2">place and ignore the other so certainly</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:44.689" style="s2">here in the US we are seeing unrest of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">kind that is I think in almost every way</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.689" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">unprecedented and that unrest is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:55.460" style="s2">obviously related to the the lockdown in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">the sense that it changed people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.460" end="00:02:01.820" style="s2">obligations in the world it caused them</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:06.180" style="s2">to be more frustrated as the economy</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.820" end="00:02:11.550" style="s2">began to take its descent and so to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.180" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">extent that that unrest of this scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.550" end="00:02:17.130" style="s2">can happen in a country</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">that is among the most stable in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.130" end="00:02:24.180" style="s2">world to the extent that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">affected by a pandemic that could emerge</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.180" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">at any time understanding what the roots</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">of that pandemic are is paramount we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to have something throw us</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">into chaos if that something is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:39.930" style="s2">preventable so in any case I do think</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">you&#39;re right people are much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.930" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">focused on other topics but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">really see it as other topics it is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">all right so how about we start with a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">couple of questions that came in during</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">the initial premiere of our original</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">discussion the first one is not about</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">the coronavirus per se but it is this am</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">i right that the glitchy computers</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:15.240" style="s2">conspiracy from your talk with Yuri</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.690" end="00:03:17.070" style="s2">Dagon was a joke if not how do you</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.240" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">assess the probability that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.070" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">that it wasn&#39;t a coincidence Thanks you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">want to start with that I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:34.020" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly a coincidence because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:35.150" style="s2">hasn&#39;t believed occurred and I just as</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.020" end="00:03:37.590" style="s2">soon as I started having problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.150" end="00:03:40.860" style="s2">completely wiped out of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.590" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">restore backup and the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.860" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">hasn&#39;t happened since at least to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">probably just a coincidence the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">that it happened with some other people</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">who are also involved with questioning</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:55.320" style="s2">kind of lab leak hypothesis it could</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:57.990" style="s2">also be a coincidence but wait wait I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.320" end="00:04:01.500" style="s2">think we&#39;re like half jokingly discuss</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.990" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">it and put out feelers into the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.500" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">the ether to see if there are other</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:06.900" style="s2">people experiencing something like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">then you know for me as we I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.900" end="00:04:10.770" style="s2">alluded to originally if we hear about</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">more people having some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.770" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">technical issues or any other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:18.180" style="s2">weird things happening in their life you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">know that could start being to pattern</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.180" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">but at this point it&#39;s just this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:26.510" style="s2">going to take a slightly different tack</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.510" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">question I think one has to behave as if</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">it is a coincidence and it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:37.670" style="s2">impossible to rule that out unless</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:42.050" style="s2">somebody sends you an unambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.670" end="00:04:45.560" style="s2">message but you had a malware problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.050" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">that took oh yeah go ahead sorry I did</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.560" end="00:04:50.120" style="s2">start getting we see to start getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">start receiving a lot of like weird you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.120" end="00:04:57.500" style="s2">know phishing emails almost much much</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:59.810" style="s2">higher number of them probably just</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.500" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">started like a couple month back I never</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.810" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">opened them but sure well there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:10.610" style="s2">possibility that people were eagerly</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:12.500" style="s2">trying to figure out what was on your</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.610" end="00:05:14.450" style="s2">machine there&#39;s a possibility that they</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.500" end="00:05:16.670" style="s2">were trying to spook you and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.450" end="00:05:19.220" style="s2">possibility that it was unrelated and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.670" end="00:05:24.410" style="s2">just a feature of the world as it exists</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.220" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">but I would say we had collapses of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.410" end="00:05:31.370" style="s2">system here related to the podcast that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">were very unusual at a technical level</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.370" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">in other words we had collapses that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:40.190" style="s2">continued to plague us even though we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:42.020" style="s2">had literally swapped out every</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.190" end="00:05:45.110" style="s2">component that could conceivably cause</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.020" end="00:05:47.030" style="s2">it so that&#39;s an unusual pattern when</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.110" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">when one is troubleshooting does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.030" end="00:05:51.470" style="s2">anything I don&#39;t know I do know that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:53.660" style="s2">timing was conspicuous but of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.470" end="00:05:54.230" style="s2">coincidence coincidences happen of their</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.660" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">own accord</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.230" end="00:06:00.530" style="s2">and what I would say is if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:05.750" style="s2">to find yourself in a realm like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.530" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">where you have you know essentially some</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.750" end="00:06:12.290" style="s2">huge range of actors has an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:15.560" style="s2">this story people want to blame China</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.290" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">China doesn&#39;t want to be blamed lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.560" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">people have turned this into a political</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:21.470" style="s2">football and they have interests in how</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:23.860" style="s2">it is understood and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.470" end="00:06:27.140" style="s2">shortage of people who might want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.860" end="00:06:30.890" style="s2">dissuade people like you and me who</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.140" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">won&#39;t look away from the story but one</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.890" end="00:06:35.270" style="s2">can&#39;t assume that every hiccup is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:37.460" style="s2">and in fact we had a hiccup at the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.270" end="00:06:40.249" style="s2">of our conversation which I think you</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.460" end="00:06:43.219" style="s2">and I both read as very unlikely to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.249" end="00:06:45.589" style="s2">anything why would you disrupt the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.219" end="00:06:47.749" style="s2">of a stream but I&#39;ve had streams</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.589" end="00:06:50.209" style="s2">disrupted at moments that were very</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.749" end="00:06:54.679" style="s2">conspicuous before and it started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.209" end="00:06:56.989" style="s2">happen I had one the most amazing set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.679" end="00:06:59.179" style="s2">collapses we had was right after I first</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.989" end="00:07:02.779" style="s2">started talking about your medium piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.179" end="00:07:04.249" style="s2">and its implications so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.779" end="00:07:07.249" style="s2">what to make of all this again I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.249" end="00:07:10.159" style="s2">one has to work from the assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.249" end="00:07:12.349" style="s2">this is an organic problem in a highly</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.159" end="00:07:13.489" style="s2">complex technological world in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.349" end="00:07:16.839" style="s2">lots of pieces that are made by</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.489" end="00:07:19.309" style="s2">different different people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.839" end="00:07:22.849" style="s2">interfacing together that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.309" end="00:07:26.329" style="s2">that&#39;s a bug prone world but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.849" end="00:07:27.649" style="s2">also a lot that&#39;s conspicuous about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.329" end="00:07:31.279" style="s2">pattern and because we all have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.649" end="00:07:33.619" style="s2">history of facing technical glitches in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.279" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">our computing lives when something</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.619" end="00:07:44.860" style="s2">really out of the ordinary happens it</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:48.529" style="s2">does have a different feel yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.860" end="00:07:51.739" style="s2">yep let&#39;s leave it at that the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.529" end="00:07:55.009" style="s2">question is if the virus had escaped</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.739" end="00:07:59.569" style="s2">from her lab why would she jangly</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.009" end="00:08:01.909" style="s2">release the sequence for our ATG 13 and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.569" end="00:08:03.469" style="s2">placed more suspicion on her lab and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.909" end="00:08:07.459" style="s2">then the second part of the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.469" end="00:08:10.519" style="s2">how do we explain the samples and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.459" end="00:08:15.259" style="s2">original patients with exposure at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.519" end="00:08:16.749" style="s2">Hunan seafood market you&#39;re probably in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.259" end="00:08:19.789" style="s2">the best position to answer this earring</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.749" end="00:08:21.589" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s try let&#39;s just address</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.789" end="00:08:23.629" style="s2">the first point first I wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.589" end="00:08:25.909" style="s2">clear on the second one let&#39;s address</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.629" end="00:08:29.749" style="s2">the first one so why would she generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.909" end="00:08:33.979" style="s2">kind of release the ATG sequence rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.749" end="00:08:36.459" style="s2">than just I guess keep being silent well</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:39.879" style="s2">the first and foremost she already</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.459" end="00:08:42.199" style="s2">released part of that sequence back in</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.879" end="00:08:45.110" style="s2">2016 I guess I mean she collected it in</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.199" end="00:08:47.779" style="s2">2013 but they had a publication in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.110" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">where they released a threat I went to</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.779" end="00:08:52.579" style="s2">the sequence to gene bank and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:08:54.230" style="s2">actually by the time she generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.579" end="00:08:56.810" style="s2">released it in 2012</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.230" end="00:08:59.570" style="s2">the full secret of the full genome they</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.810" end="00:09:01.730" style="s2">were already groups I think with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.570" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">print print or just maybe some comments</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.730" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">on biology blog somewhere who identified</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:11.540" style="s2">that very fragment and they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">essentially kind of on the trail she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.540" end="00:09:16.970" style="s2">usually saying this is the closest</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:19.580" style="s2">relative of stars to that we were able</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.970" end="00:09:22.820" style="s2">to find using you know the blasting of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.580" end="00:09:25.940" style="s2">genomic sequences in the database so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.820" end="00:09:27.950" style="s2">unless she kind of release the full she</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.940" end="00:09:30.110" style="s2">basically she would be made to release</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.950" end="00:09:32.029" style="s2">the false you know anyway so it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.110" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s much better for her to do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.029" end="00:09:36.529" style="s2">proactively rather than wait for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:39.770" style="s2">know some comfortable questions</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.529" end="00:09:44.360" style="s2">and secondly she could of course release</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.770" end="00:09:46.880" style="s2">the the sequence that she most you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.360" end="00:09:48.890" style="s2">would be most favorable with again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.880" end="00:09:51.860" style="s2">not saying she&#39;s trying to doctor than</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.890" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">any in any way home but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.860" end="00:09:57.410" style="s2">possibility so maybe she was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:10:01.730" style="s2">she could have been trying to divert the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.410" end="00:10:03.410" style="s2">attention of the people to from the you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.730" end="00:10:06.820" style="s2">know maybe a closer sequence they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.410" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">in their possession by using the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.820" end="00:10:12.140" style="s2">fragment that she already released in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:14.180" style="s2">the G Bank years ago and then building</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.140" end="00:10:19.490" style="s2">around it with a four percent difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.180" end="00:10:21.020" style="s2">from the current starts to genome but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.490" end="00:10:23.480" style="s2">mean she it&#39;s not like she had an option</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.020" end="00:10:26.150" style="s2">of just staying silent was precisely</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.480" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">because she sure you made know that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.150" end="00:10:32.510" style="s2">had the closest fragment yeah I agree</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">with this analysis she didn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.510" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:38.900" style="s2">that it was the I mean if this had been</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:41.150" style="s2">an escape from her lab and she is aware</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.900" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">of that fact that&#39;s a big if but if</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.150" end="00:10:49.100" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened and for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:50.900" style="s2">reason she was hoping that that would</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.100" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">not be the conclusion of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.900" end="00:10:58.610" style="s2">community she had very little choice but</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:11:00.589" style="s2">to to release the sequence and as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.610" end="00:11:03.290" style="s2">talked about in our earlier discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.589" end="00:11:05.860" style="s2">there&#39;s also the question about is there</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.290" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">something about the four nine nine one</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.860" end="00:11:09.290" style="s2">strain</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">that is connected to something in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.290" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">possibly the database that was deleted</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:16.100" style="s2">that was very conspicuous and by</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">releasing it as if it was a separate</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.100" end="00:11:19.640" style="s2">strain that it might lead people in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:21.500" style="s2">different direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.640" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">again this is speculative we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.500" end="00:11:26.030" style="s2">saying this did happen we&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:28.820" style="s2">we know but we&#39;re saying this is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.030" end="00:11:31.310" style="s2">behavior that suggests that this person</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.820" end="00:11:34.730" style="s2">is necessarily trying to shed light on</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.310" end="00:11:36.830" style="s2">what happened if you know let&#39;s take the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.730" end="00:11:41.630" style="s2">possibility that the Chinese government</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.830" end="00:11:45.620" style="s2">has exerted pressure and said we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.630" end="00:11:47.270" style="s2">want this understood it could be that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.620" end="00:11:51.350" style="s2">she&#39;s doing this under duress so there</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.270" end="00:11:53.210" style="s2">are lots of possibilities but there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.350" end="00:11:56.600" style="s2">don&#39;t see anything exonerating in her</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.210" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">releasing that sequence right and also I</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:01.930" style="s2">think she released it after there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">this Indian reprint that alleged some</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.930" end="00:12:07.490" style="s2">small fragments from the HIV genome</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:09.830" style="s2">being present being stars too and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.490" end="00:12:12.050" style="s2">maybe that was her kind of reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.830" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">show that no actually those fragments</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.050" end="00:12:16.250" style="s2">were present in their ancestral strain</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.850" end="00:12:18.200" style="s2">or like the close relative so she had to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.250" end="00:12:21.710" style="s2">release that ancestral strain to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.200" end="00:12:23.480" style="s2">you know add evidence to her claims and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.710" end="00:12:24.140" style="s2">she seemed very upset with that Indian</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.480" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">preprint</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.140" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">the I think in WeChat or somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:33.230" style="s2">somewhere she said that she hopes those</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">scientists close their stinking mouths</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.230" end="00:12:39.830" style="s2">or something like that relating to that</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:41.630" style="s2">very very frequent and so that could be</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.830" end="00:12:44.950" style="s2">another another reason why she decided</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.630" end="00:12:48.440" style="s2">to release it and also it does seem that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.950" end="00:12:50.300" style="s2">there is you know maybe if not panic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.440" end="00:12:53.240" style="s2">to definitely someone some duress as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.300" end="00:12:54.980" style="s2">said that her team is under and I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.240" end="00:12:57.500" style="s2">the whole is - hydrology is under and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.980" end="00:12:59.840" style="s2">they&#39;re getting some you know external</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.500" end="00:13:02.450" style="s2">control from the military imposed upon</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.840" end="00:13:04.780" style="s2">them from Beijing the major general Chen</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.450" end="00:13:08.740" style="s2">I think she overtook leadership in</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.780" end="00:13:12.170" style="s2">history biology and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.740" end="00:13:14.990" style="s2">necessarily like a cold calculated to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.170" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">move it could be again just something</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.990" end="00:13:20.360" style="s2">that they decided to do to exonerate</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">themselves in the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.360" end="00:13:28.459" style="s2">however maybe of their unit impose to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:30.459" style="s2">the leadership from the king they</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.459" end="00:13:33.050" style="s2">decided to show that it&#39;s not them</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.459" end="00:13:35.390" style="s2">finally there is another kind of line of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.050" end="00:13:38.209" style="s2">thinking this I agree that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.390" end="00:13:40.870" style="s2">bit of a more conspiratorial idea that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.209" end="00:13:43.790" style="s2">maybe this is her kind of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.870" end="00:13:46.070" style="s2">about some other lab whereas her</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.790" end="00:13:48.589" style="s2">phrasing is a little bit interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.070" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">that she says she swears on her life</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.589" end="00:13:53.660" style="s2">that it didn&#39;t come from her lab so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:54.950" style="s2">kind of opens leafs opens the</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.660" end="00:13:56.839" style="s2">possibility that it could have come from</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.950" end="00:13:58.579" style="s2">some other lab and she might know but</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.839" end="00:14:01.310" style="s2">she&#39;s not you know in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.579" end="00:14:03.890" style="s2">fully say this and by releasing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.310" end="00:14:06.470" style="s2">sequence she&#39;s maybe you know giving</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.890" end="00:14:08.660" style="s2">some hints as to okay you guys figure</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.470" end="00:14:12.320" style="s2">out what I mean exactly where this could</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.660" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">come from yes it would be wonderful if</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.320" end="00:14:17.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a possibility it would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:19.459" style="s2">wonderful if it if there was some</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.000" end="00:14:21.290" style="s2">mechanism as we talked about in our</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.459" end="00:14:23.149" style="s2">earlier discussion if there was some</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.290" end="00:14:26.779" style="s2">mechanism that allowed people to</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.430" end="00:14:38.839" style="s2">ask you this and so go ahead yeah</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.910" end="00:15:10.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t think nobody from Wuhan still to</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.769" style="s2">this day I&#39;ve heard rest this story and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.730" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">we know that they&#39;re leading kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.769" end="00:15:19.970" style="s2">SARS guy the academician Zhang I keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:22.519" style="s2">his name but he&#39;s like the mr. Stars guy</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.970" end="00:15:24.800" style="s2">he was in charge essentially of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.519" end="00:15:27.529" style="s2">pneumonia investigation he actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.800" end="00:15:30.770" style="s2">ordered the miner samples checked for</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.529" end="00:15:32.580" style="s2">SARS antibodies back in 2013 and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.770" end="00:15:34.860" style="s2">they actually did the working in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.580" end="00:15:37.410" style="s2">the one Institute and she&#39;s yelling was</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.860" end="00:15:39.990" style="s2">definitely in the look of this work and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.410" end="00:15:42.840" style="s2">since this is still not mentioned to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.990" end="00:15:44.760" style="s2">this day officially like in the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.840" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">press or in any other scientific</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.760" end="00:15:52.290" style="s2">publications it&#39;s definitely you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:54.060" style="s2">still a big question mark but yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.290" end="00:15:57.420" style="s2">as you pointed out in our last</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.060" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">discussion the place to pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.420" end="00:16:03.630" style="s2">trail would be those samples if if we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.890" style="s2">had access to them yeah so anyway if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.630" end="00:16:07.770" style="s2">world is trying to figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.890" end="00:16:10.890" style="s2">next that would be a good bet in order</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.770" end="00:16:14.010" style="s2">to shed more light on the story you</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.890" end="00:16:20.130" style="s2">raised the issue of the claim that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:22.050" style="s2">are sequences from HIV in SARS Cove -</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.130" end="00:16:25.140" style="s2">and I remember when I first saw that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.050" end="00:16:27.090" style="s2">claim I thought no way and then I saw</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.140" end="00:16:29.940" style="s2">some stuff that suggested to me actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.090" end="00:16:32.790" style="s2">there might be and I my first reaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.940" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">was wow that would be open-and-shut case</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.790" end="00:16:36.900" style="s2">if there were and then I remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:38.190" style="s2">looking into it and realizing that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.900" end="00:16:40.940" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the reason it would be an</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.190" end="00:16:43.470" style="s2">open-and-shut case I thought was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.940" end="00:16:46.200" style="s2">coronaviruses and retroviruses are so</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.470" end="00:16:49.620" style="s2">distantly related I mean if related at</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.200" end="00:16:52.920" style="s2">all that the transmission of sequences</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.620" end="00:16:55.080" style="s2">from one group to the other would likely</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.920" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">have been accomplished technologically</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.080" end="00:17:00.690" style="s2">but when I looked into the that claim I</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:04.230" style="s2">remember I don&#39;t exactly remember what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.690" end="00:17:05.550" style="s2">the evidence was but actually I got the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.230" end="00:17:09.660" style="s2">sense that it would not be that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.550" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">surprising and I I abandoned that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.660" end="00:17:15.240" style="s2">line of thinking do you have thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:19.160" style="s2">information on the possibility of HIV</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.240" end="00:17:23.640" style="s2">sequences showing up in SARS Cove -</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.160" end="00:17:26.130" style="s2">right I along with everybody else was</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.640" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">you know once it was analyzed that those</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.130" end="00:17:30.690" style="s2">actual sequences the fragments are just</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:32.610" style="s2">very short fragments and it could have</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.690" end="00:17:35.820" style="s2">been just essentially acquaintances that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.610" end="00:17:40.050" style="s2">you know pretty much any short enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.820" end="00:17:43.190" style="s2">strain of letters showing up in any</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:46.730" style="s2">other genome might be a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:50.600" style="s2">but I think this storyline was picked up</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.730" end="00:17:52.760" style="s2">again by Luc montagnier a French Nobel</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.600" end="00:17:55.910" style="s2">Prize winning scientist and he still</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.760" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">continues you know promoting this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.910" end="00:18:02.410" style="s2">although the mainstream scientific</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:05.420" style="s2">mainstream is even farther from this</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.410" end="00:18:08.450" style="s2">line of reasoning is this from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.420" end="00:18:10.250" style="s2">general lab leak hypothesis but I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.450" end="00:18:12.470" style="s2">to be honest I didn&#39;t really get back</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.250" end="00:18:15.170" style="s2">into this or I didn&#39;t read his trip</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.470" end="00:18:17.180" style="s2">although he has published a preprint</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.170" end="00:18:20.110" style="s2">allure they seem to you know provide</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.180" end="00:18:24.350" style="s2">more evidence so far some HIV related</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.110" end="00:18:27.620" style="s2">genetic fragments in source code - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.350" end="00:18:31.370" style="s2">I recall looking into his work initially</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.620" end="00:18:33.290" style="s2">his credential is obviously based on</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.370" end="00:18:36.730" style="s2">such powerful prior work that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.290" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">hard to ignore his belief that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.730" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">contains HIV fragments and that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.840" style="s2">essentially is a smoking gun but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">remember looking into it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.840" end="00:18:50.420" style="s2">mechanistically I was just not compelled</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:54.820" style="s2">that the story added up but certainly on</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.420" end="00:18:57.230" style="s2">the list of hypotheses I believe it on</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.820" end="00:18:59.060" style="s2">we have to we have to analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.230" end="00:19:02.510" style="s2">carefully and figure out whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.060" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">what is being claimed is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.510" end="00:19:13.430" style="s2">improbable that it implies a special</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">origin origin explanation all right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.430" end="00:19:24.100" style="s2">let&#39;s see this one seafood market yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.640" end="00:19:32.360" style="s2">maybe I think the I mean at this point</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:34.250" style="s2">we can safely rule out dude who know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.360" end="00:19:36.920" style="s2">seafood market as the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.250" end="00:19:39.950" style="s2">outbreak as has been ruled out by even</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.920" end="00:19:41.690" style="s2">you know mainstream China that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.950" end="00:19:44.270" style="s2">official position now that the virus</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.690" end="00:19:46.630" style="s2">came into the market before it came out</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.270" end="00:19:49.100" style="s2">of the market to use the quote</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.630" end="00:19:50.780" style="s2">essentially because even initially</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.100" end="00:19:53.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a slants of publication</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.780" end="00:19:55.340" style="s2">analyzing the first patients and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.000" end="00:19:56.570" style="s2">first I think three out of four patients</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.340" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.570" end="00:20:02.150" style="s2">treated in the hospital with the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:03.740" style="s2">with the SARS cough - coronavirus three</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.150" end="00:20:05.630" style="s2">of the four didn&#39;t have exported - who</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.740" end="00:20:08.420" style="s2">knows if good work and that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.630" end="00:20:11.660" style="s2">the early sign that is probably not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.420" end="00:20:14.030" style="s2">source of the outbreak and later on when</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.660" end="00:20:16.550" style="s2">they analyzed samples from from that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.030" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">market although there&#39;s we are very</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.550" end="00:20:22.010" style="s2">interestingly not very many samples were</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:24.770" style="s2">collected before the market was</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.010" end="00:20:26.930" style="s2">completely sanitized and scrubbed but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.770" end="00:20:30.590" style="s2">was still like there weren&#39;t any animal</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.930" end="00:20:33.250" style="s2">samples off anything close to the source</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.590" end="00:20:36.080" style="s2">code to just kind of human samples which</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.250" end="00:20:39.340" style="s2">almost certainly were to spend time</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.080" end="00:20:41.990" style="s2">related of people who had sorry co2</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">already you know picked up been chewed</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.990" end="00:20:45.980" style="s2">out somewhere else outside of the market</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:49.130" style="s2">and brought it in yeah I think at this</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.980" end="00:20:51.470" style="s2">point we can rule out the market as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.130" end="00:20:53.720" style="s2">source what we can say in retrospect is</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.470" end="00:20:56.150" style="s2">that the evidence for the market is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.720" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">circumstantial evidence basically of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.150" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">proximity that there is no evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:04.550" style="s2">the virus in animals in the market and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:05.900" style="s2">there&#39;s evidence of people who had no</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.550" end="00:21:10.810" style="s2">connection to the market who were sick</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.900" end="00:21:14.290" style="s2">in the first the first round and so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.810" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">effectively takes it to an extremely low</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.290" end="00:21:19.640" style="s2">probability the interesting thing though</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:22.310" style="s2">is that in the announcement that China</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.640" end="00:21:25.910" style="s2">had revised its explanation and was no</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.310" end="00:21:28.730" style="s2">longer it did no it no longer believed</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.910" end="00:21:31.610" style="s2">that the Wuhan seafood market was the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.730" end="00:21:35.230" style="s2">source it also dismissed the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.610" end="00:21:39.740" style="s2">origin hypothesis so it sort of had this</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.230" end="00:21:42.140" style="s2">poison pill aspect to it in which they</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.740" end="00:21:43.880" style="s2">they were almost like negotiating with</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.140" end="00:21:45.770" style="s2">the logic will grant you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.880" end="00:21:48.650" style="s2">right that the Wuhan seafood market is</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.770" end="00:21:51.410" style="s2">not involved but the lab is also not</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.650" end="00:21:54.650" style="s2">involved with no compelling evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.410" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">why we should assume that now let me ask</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.650" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2">you as long as we&#39;re here the there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.070" end="00:22:05.570" style="s2">a couple of pieces of analysis floating</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.040" end="00:22:10.010" style="s2">around about behavior in and around the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.570" end="00:22:10.450" style="s2">Wuhan virality Institute Wuhan Institute</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.010" end="00:22:16.299" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.450" end="00:22:18.820" style="s2">and hospitals in Wuhan China where there</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.299" end="00:22:22.649" style="s2">is an anomalous behavior detected and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.820" end="00:22:27.970" style="s2">the claim is that these things imply</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.649" end="00:22:30.759" style="s2">that there was awareness of an accident</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.970" end="00:22:33.279" style="s2">in the case of the virality Institute</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.759" end="00:22:36.580" style="s2">and that there was awareness or that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.279" end="00:22:41.109" style="s2">there was in a medically annales influx</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.580" end="00:22:43.299" style="s2">of patients into the hospital I guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.109" end="00:22:45.669" style="s2">this would have been October is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.299" end="00:22:48.700" style="s2">right do you have any thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.669" end="00:22:51.580" style="s2">whether that those pieces of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.700" end="00:22:55.210" style="s2">actually imply anything have you looked</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.580" end="00:22:57.609" style="s2">at them I have everybody just you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.210" end="00:23:00.759" style="s2">I&#39;ve once then use hits I looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.609" end="00:23:03.129" style="s2">information I think you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.759" end="00:23:05.889" style="s2">two kind of different sets of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.129" end="00:23:08.679" style="s2">first being analysis of cellular signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.889" end="00:23:12.249" style="s2">around the within lab that report it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.679" end="00:23:13.629" style="s2">some kind of blackout period in October</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.249" end="00:23:15.220" style="s2">I think early role so when you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.629" end="00:23:18.039" style="s2">cellular you mean cellular phone</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.220" end="00:23:19.929" style="s2">activity right mm-hmm right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.039" end="00:23:21.909" style="s2">yes all your own activity that seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.929" end="00:23:27.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a I guess publicly collected</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.909" end="00:23:29.529" style="s2">database anonymized which is used by all</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.730" end="00:23:33.669" style="s2">sorts of commercial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.529" end="00:23:36.549" style="s2">providers to analyze trends of potential</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.669" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">consumers so basically a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.549" end="00:23:40.389" style="s2">companies are collecting all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:43.929" style="s2">cellular data of pretty much everybody</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.389" end="00:23:46.450" style="s2">this data can be available to these</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.929" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">providers who can mine it somebody mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.450" end="00:23:52.389" style="s2">that data and saw that at the time of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:55.029" style="s2">the early October there was a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.389" end="00:23:57.489" style="s2">drop in the usual number of cell phones</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.029" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">and cell phone traffic associated with</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.489" end="00:24:05.379" style="s2">the area of the Institute&#39;s bsl-4</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:07.720" style="s2">facility and on the basis of this they</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.379" end="00:24:09.879" style="s2">could hypothesize with baby to signify</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.720" end="00:24:12.519" style="s2">some kind of accidents and shutdown in</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.879" end="00:24:14.230" style="s2">the area and also they seem to implicate</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.519" end="00:24:16.359" style="s2">that there was some kind of traffic</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.230" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">shutdown because not only didn&#39;t lab</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.359" end="00:24:21.580" style="s2">itself but the area around it the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">traffic around like the the he cooler</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.580" end="00:24:26.630" style="s2">traffic with cell phones I guess they</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.960" end="00:24:28.660" style="s2">my head has greatly diminished for for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.630" end="00:24:31.070" style="s2">period of I guess two weeks or something</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.660" end="00:24:33.140" style="s2">saying all this from memory it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.070" end="00:24:36.200" style="s2">while since I looked like my little bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.140" end="00:24:39.650" style="s2">off on some data points so that was one</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:41.930" style="s2">thing and it was released deccan two</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.650" end="00:24:43.850" style="s2">months ago and since then and nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.930" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">really had any follow up so it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.850" end="00:24:48.680" style="s2">died down there was no follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:52.430" style="s2">investigation by regular intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.680" end="00:24:54.650" style="s2">agency or anybody else and then recently</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.430" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">there was another circumstantial</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.650" end="00:25:00.140" style="s2">evidence of consumer trans released</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:03.260" style="s2">which was these first of all parking</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.140" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">lots around hospitals exhibiting many</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.260" end="00:25:09.290" style="s2">more cars last fall versus default a</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:13.430" style="s2">year previously and secondly the keyword</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.290" end="00:25:13.910" style="s2">searches for diarrhea and fever if I run</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.430" end="00:25:17.330" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.910" end="00:25:21.560" style="s2">that kind of spiked in again I think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.330" end="00:25:24.050" style="s2">was October or Oh late September</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.560" end="00:25:26.330" style="s2">something like that so they were trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.050" end="00:25:29.330" style="s2">to tie that into the idea that actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.330" end="00:25:33.500" style="s2">the virus circulating in Wuhan or in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.330" end="00:25:35.420" style="s2">hebei province is much earlier than it</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.500" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">was kind of officially well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.420" end="00:25:39.800" style="s2">may be recognized and secondly just may</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:42.380" style="s2">be realized maybe you know the hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.800" end="00:25:44.870" style="s2">or the authorities just didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.380" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">they have this kind of initial stages of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.870" end="00:25:53.300" style="s2">clinical and on their hands I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:55.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a valid hypothesis it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.300" end="00:25:58.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know if how strong it is because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.010" end="00:26:01.070" style="s2">mean generally I guess every year we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.160" end="00:26:04.730" style="s2">have all sorts of viruses around this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.070" end="00:26:06.680" style="s2">time and whether spike and keyboard</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.730" end="00:26:09.140" style="s2">searches for diarrhea is indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.680" end="00:26:11.090" style="s2">this particular strain of kind of assess</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.140" end="00:26:13.490" style="s2">well stranger starts to being a presence</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.090" end="00:26:19.070" style="s2">in the population that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.490" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a valid conjecture or</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.070" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">connection or the tube precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:24.980" style="s2">I mean even in Russia there was a spike</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:27.800" style="s2">in pneumonias back in November and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.980" end="00:26:29.300" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of where there were at</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.800" end="00:26:31.540" style="s2">least I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any more</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.300" end="00:26:34.040" style="s2">but there were a lot of getting</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.540" end="00:26:36.200" style="s2">conjectures that maybe we Russia have</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.040" end="00:26:37.610" style="s2">been exposed to source cough too much</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.200" end="00:26:40.280" style="s2">previously we</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.610" end="00:26:42.520" style="s2">we develop survey you mean immunity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.280" end="00:26:44.570" style="s2">this is one of the kind of popular</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.520" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">people&#39;s explanation why we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.570" end="00:26:50.330" style="s2">getting the same level of pandemic back</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.340" style="s2">in March as the rest of the world was</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.330" end="00:26:54.650" style="s2">the idea was well maybe we had it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.340" end="00:26:57.049" style="s2">November we didn&#39;t know this of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.650" end="00:26:57.559" style="s2">then we got the same thing as the rest</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.049" end="00:26:59.450" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.559" end="00:27:02.330" style="s2">maybe just a couple of weeks delayed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.450" end="00:27:03.920" style="s2">that idea they don&#39;t yeah so I I had the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.330" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">same same thought which is that in order</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.920" end="00:27:08.990" style="s2">to assess especially no it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.380" end="00:27:11.570" style="s2">true for both the cell phone data and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.990" end="00:27:14.900" style="s2">hospital data what one wants to do is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.570" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">analysis of if you survey an area at</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.900" end="00:27:20.750" style="s2">random that looks something like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:23.240" style="s2">Hebei province for example how often do</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.750" end="00:27:25.790" style="s2">you see something this anomalous right</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.240" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">in other words would you see lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.790" end="00:27:29.059" style="s2">things that were there a viral Aegean</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:30.200" style="s2">stitute you might think it was an</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.059" end="00:27:33.049" style="s2">accident but there&#39;s no virality</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.200" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">Institute so you don&#39;t notice it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.049" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">anyway I had the same sense that the ice</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:41.059" style="s2">was not very thick with respect to these</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:44.929" style="s2">couple of claims that said it could be</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.059" end="00:27:47.090" style="s2">evidence and if you found that cell</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.929" end="00:27:50.030" style="s2">phone traffic dying down in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.090" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">we see it in in October around the moon</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.030" end="00:27:54.830" style="s2">on the one Institute was a very unusual</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.390" end="00:27:57.590" style="s2">event than it would be stronger evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.830" end="00:27:59.450" style="s2">but at this point we in the public don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.590" end="00:28:01.160" style="s2">know how common these things are and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.450" end="00:28:06.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t assess these pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.160" end="00:28:10.610" style="s2">data right another similar piece of data</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.440" end="00:28:13.270" style="s2">that kind of get went uninvestigated was</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.610" end="00:28:16.400" style="s2">this leak from US intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.270" end="00:28:19.190" style="s2">apparently somewhere in the US</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.400" end="00:28:21.650" style="s2">intelligence community was kind of ring</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.190" end="00:28:23.570" style="s2">alarm bells in November that there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.650" end="00:28:25.910" style="s2">already an outbreak in Wuhan that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.570" end="00:28:28.100" style="s2">gonna be serious and they see all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.910" end="00:28:30.500" style="s2">of disruptions already in place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.100" end="00:28:32.450" style="s2">supposedly this was November and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.500" end="00:28:35.660" style="s2">was published in Washington Post I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.450" end="00:28:38.179" style="s2">but then again it was like never follow</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.660" end="00:28:41.809" style="s2">it up so we don&#39;t know how real that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.179" end="00:28:42.320" style="s2">info was why did it ultimately get</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.809" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">ignored</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.320" end="00:28:47.870" style="s2">so I mean still a lot of unanswered</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:49.490" style="s2">questions and maybe some point these</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.870" end="00:28:51.030" style="s2">whole pieces the possible puzzle will</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.490" end="00:28:53.130" style="s2">fit or maybe it&#39;s just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.030" end="00:28:55.800" style="s2">red herrings and some mr. petitioner</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.130" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">files leaks that we just can&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.800" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">sit through yep okay let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:03.780" style="s2">the next question</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:05.790" style="s2">next question says suppose we develop a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.780" end="00:29:08.040" style="s2">corona virus vaccine that with minor</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.790" end="00:29:12.180" style="s2">tweaks could also be effective on bats</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.040" end="00:29:16.170" style="s2">as well thoughts on dispersing in bat</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.180" end="00:29:18.330" style="s2">populations as an extra buffer I have</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.170" end="00:29:23.190" style="s2">some thoughts here as a bat biologist do</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.330" end="00:29:27.630" style="s2">you want to start yeah so my first</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.190" end="00:29:30.180" style="s2">thought is first of all as widespread as</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.630" end="00:29:32.730" style="s2">fear of vaccination is amongst humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.180" end="00:29:35.670" style="s2">it&#39;s even worse in bats and so my guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.730" end="00:29:35.970" style="s2">is they just won&#39;t go along with it all</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.670" end="00:29:37.770" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.970" end="00:29:39.690" style="s2">yet English that was a hilariously funny</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.770" end="00:29:44.460" style="s2">joke only worth a chuckle in Russian I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.690" end="00:29:46.710" style="s2">guess but so it was good the I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.460" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">real question here first of all the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.710" end="00:29:53.310" style="s2">that you would have a vaccine in humans</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:56.160" style="s2">that works in bats it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.310" end="00:29:58.710" style="s2">how you would even establish that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.160" end="00:30:02.040" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously doable but is it worth</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.710" end="00:30:04.500" style="s2">the extra effort to figure out whether</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.040" end="00:30:06.660" style="s2">or not you know if let&#39;s say that minor</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.500" end="00:30:07.770" style="s2">tweaks are necessary that&#39;s not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.660" end="00:30:10.920" style="s2">matter to figure out what those minor</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.770" end="00:30:12.930" style="s2">tweaks are and figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.920" end="00:30:15.690" style="s2">vaccinate bats and whether it has worked</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.930" end="00:30:17.700" style="s2">is going to be a long-term project at</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.690" end="00:30:20.190" style="s2">the very least and I think the really</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.700" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">important issue is the same one that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.190" end="00:30:23.100" style="s2">applies generally to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.140" style="s2">gain-of-function research for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.100" end="00:30:27.060" style="s2">purpose of figuring out how to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.140" end="00:30:29.280" style="s2">pandemics which is if gain-of-function</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.060" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">research is more likely to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.280" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">pandemic than it is to give us useful</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:35.730" style="s2">information about how to present a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:38.400" style="s2">prevent one then it&#39;s not a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.730" end="00:30:42.780" style="s2">and likewise attempting to vaccinate</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.400" end="00:30:45.480" style="s2">bats against against viruses that could</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.780" end="00:30:49.170" style="s2">leap to humans and then could evolve</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.480" end="00:30:51.720" style="s2">into a pandemic is probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.170" end="00:30:54.330" style="s2">create such a increase in the intensity</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.720" end="00:30:56.280" style="s2">of human back contact with exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.330" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">bats that are harboring these viruses</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.280" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">that I would say it&#39;s probably a losing</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">proposition to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.299" end="00:31:10.140" style="s2">yeah absolutely I think you know having</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:12.179" style="s2">some kind of that vaccination program</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.140" end="00:31:14.540" style="s2">where it&#39;s like gene driving bets to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.179" end="00:31:18.150" style="s2">clear the wolf any sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.540" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">coronaviruses is there a good use of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.150" end="00:31:24.690" style="s2">people&#39;s money or time or yes and plus</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">my create extra dangers I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.690" end="00:31:29.610" style="s2">just better off leaving the bats alone</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.190" end="00:31:32.460" style="s2">just both for research purposes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.610" end="00:31:34.890" style="s2">human purposes and actually I think she</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.460" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">gently is one was one of her missions to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.890" end="00:31:40.679" style="s2">stop the kind of the barbaric notion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:43.740" style="s2">people eating that that was one of her</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.679" end="00:31:46.980" style="s2">key points in her talk 20:18 like a dead</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.740" end="00:31:48.990" style="s2">light talk she gave in China and she</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.980" end="00:31:51.510" style="s2">actually said that this is this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:56.750" style="s2">is a payback for Humanity for bad manic</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.510" end="00:32:00.660" style="s2">practices of imposing you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.750" end="00:32:02.700" style="s2">disturbing wildlife so in that sense but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.660" end="00:32:05.549" style="s2">you know I think before we start going</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.700" end="00:32:07.799" style="s2">vaccinating bats we have a minor issue</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.549" end="00:32:10.590" style="s2">of not even having a human vaccine first</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.799" end="00:32:13.010" style="s2">and this is desperately needed you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.590" end="00:32:13.010" style="s2">our purpose</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.299" end="00:32:19.320" style="s2">yeah so I agree with you the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.919" end="00:32:23.100" style="s2">vaccine is obviously the priority I</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.320" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">think in the meantime if we just ask the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.100" end="00:32:28.020" style="s2">bats to social distance that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">the best best we can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.020" end="00:32:34.970" style="s2">you know fly to wing lengths apart that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:36.900" style="s2">kind of thing all right next question</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:39.480" style="s2">what concerns me most</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.900" end="00:32:41.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the experts got it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.480" end="00:32:44.400" style="s2">initially it&#39;s how adamant they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.750" end="00:32:45.690" style="s2">that it couldn&#39;t be questioned or that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.400" end="00:32:48.630" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t be questioning I</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.690" end="00:32:51.030" style="s2">absolutely agree with this experts are</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.630" end="00:32:55.169" style="s2">they have to have leeway to get things</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.030" end="00:32:59.580" style="s2">wrong and frankly even the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.169" end="00:33:01.559" style="s2">certainty is a an indicator that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.580" end="00:33:04.470" style="s2">something has gone wrong there was such</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.559" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">a strong desire to shut down the lab</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.470" end="00:33:08.549" style="s2">leak hypothesis to begin with that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:09.510" style="s2">weren&#39;t having a scientific discussion</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.549" end="00:33:12.590" style="s2">we were having a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.510" end="00:33:15.890" style="s2">scientists that was not scientific</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.590" end="00:33:18.740" style="s2">and and as I pointed out in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.890" end="00:33:21.830" style="s2">discussion earlier this creates a new</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.740" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">problem for us a novel one which is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.830" end="00:33:26.360" style="s2">very people we need most to speak</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:28.510" style="s2">without us doubting their credibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.360" end="00:33:30.529" style="s2">have all indicted their credibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.510" end="00:33:33.710" style="s2">simultaneously that really couldn&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.529" end="00:33:36.380" style="s2">more dangerous circumstance so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.710" end="00:33:37.820" style="s2">we can learn that lesson as painful as</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.380" end="00:33:47.179" style="s2">it is let&#39;s learn it and never let that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.820" end="00:33:50.899" style="s2">happen again thank you all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.179" end="00:33:53.659" style="s2">next person says in honor of the mighty</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.899" end="00:33:55.970" style="s2">Pangolin I must say pangolins I hate</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.659" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">that they were implicated in this story</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.970" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">I&#39;m a big fan of this creature</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:03.289" style="s2">so yes the mighty Pangolin it&#39;s a shame</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:07.340" style="s2">but do realize for anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.289" end="00:34:11.060" style="s2">thinking that penguins and bats are a</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.340" end="00:34:13.129" style="s2">task that these viruses are parasitizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.060" end="00:34:14.780" style="s2">them the same way they are parasitizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.129" end="00:34:17.950" style="s2">us so the bats and the pangolins are on</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.780" end="00:34:24.250" style="s2">our side right they didn&#39;t do this to us</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.950" end="00:34:29.389" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a terrible joke yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.250" end="00:34:31.369" style="s2">terrible actually I had an advisor guy</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.389" end="00:34:33.589" style="s2">named Charles Handley who was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.369" end="00:34:37.190" style="s2">great bat biologists I was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.589" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">Smithsonian curator of mammals and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.190" end="00:34:42.830" style="s2">one point after the Vietnam War I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:45.080" style="s2">tried to convince the military that they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.830" end="00:34:47.119" style="s2">should equip and fighter jets with mist</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.080" end="00:34:48.710" style="s2">nets so that if somebody crashed in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.119" end="00:34:51.740" style="s2">jungle that they could feed themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.710" end="00:34:54.530" style="s2">on bats and in order to test that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.740" end="00:34:57.020" style="s2">hypothesis or the hypothesis that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.530" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">was a viable way to survive he lived for</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.020" end="00:35:02.780" style="s2">a month that way and when I asked him</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:08.599" style="s2">how the bats were he looked at me with</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.780" end="00:35:10.430" style="s2">no humor in his eyes and said crunchy so</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.599" end="00:35:11.930" style="s2">anyway that also tells you something</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.430" end="00:35:13.880" style="s2">because I mean he the best he would have</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.930" end="00:35:15.830" style="s2">been eating were new world bats I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.880" end="00:35:17.390" style="s2">sure that they&#39;re harboring large</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.830" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">numbers of coronaviruses but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.390" end="00:35:21.830" style="s2">this concern wasn&#39;t on anybody&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:24.349" style="s2">when he did that work so that tells you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.830" end="00:35:26.440" style="s2">that there are dangers hidden in plain</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.349" end="00:35:29.930" style="s2">sight</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.440" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">okay next question</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.930" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">I&#39;m struggling to understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:36.950" style="s2">are talking about I am so interested and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">I want to learn more thank you I</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.950" end="00:35:42.109" style="s2">highlighted this one because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:44.750" style="s2">it was worth giving a kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.109" end="00:35:47.779" style="s2">paragraph summary of what you and I are</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.750" end="00:35:49.849" style="s2">on about here why this is a focus why it</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.779" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">matters you want to take a crack at it</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.849" end="00:35:58.309" style="s2">or do you want me to please so I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:36:00.170" style="s2">say we have a pandemic it&#39;s creating a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.309" end="00:36:02.690" style="s2">tremendous amount of harm</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.170" end="00:36:04.760" style="s2">there&#39;s the harm it&#39;s doing and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:07.089" style="s2">the harm that we are doing to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.760" end="00:36:12.049" style="s2">in an effort to stop it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.089" end="00:36:17.180" style="s2">the origin of that pandemic is of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.049" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">tremendous importance because one it may</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.180" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">contain lessons about how we ended up</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:22.849" style="s2">here that will allow us to prevent this</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">from happening in the future whether</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.849" end="00:36:29.450" style="s2">those lessons are about a human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.520" end="00:36:33.380" style="s2">like eating bush meat that causes us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.450" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">come in contact with zoonotic viruses or</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.380" end="00:36:37.430" style="s2">whether it&#39;s about gain-of-function</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:39.740" style="s2">research in the lab it is important that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.430" end="00:36:41.329" style="s2">we figure out what we did wrong so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.740" end="00:36:46.039" style="s2">we stop doing it and this doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.329" end="00:36:48.910" style="s2">again second thing is that to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.039" end="00:36:53.000" style="s2">that one finds the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.910" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">rallying around a point expressing a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.000" end="00:36:58.940" style="s2">consensus that is similar to what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">would hear around the question of does</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.940" end="00:37:06.950" style="s2">the Earth orbit the Sun or does HIV</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:09.170" style="s2">cause AIDS or any one of a number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.950" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">secure hypotheses when you hear that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.170" end="00:37:14.650" style="s2">kind of resolute consensus and then you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:16.910" style="s2">look at the data and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.650" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">analysis and the analysis far falls</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.910" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">apart and the data suggests a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:26.779" style="s2">is viable that has been eliminated from</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:28.460" style="s2">the table it suggests that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.779" end="00:37:31.190" style="s2">whole different vulnerability and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.460" end="00:37:33.740" style="s2">vulnerability is in the way your</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.190" end="00:37:36.170" style="s2">scientific apparatus functions and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.740" end="00:37:39.380" style="s2">are so dependent on our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.170" end="00:37:41.329" style="s2">apparatus being above politics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.380" end="00:37:43.369" style="s2">of the market and in a position to tell</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.329" end="00:37:47.240" style="s2">us when we are putting ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.369" end="00:37:49.970" style="s2">danger that even just simply detecting</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.240" end="00:37:51.950" style="s2">that scientists are reaching a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.970" end="00:37:54.529" style="s2">that is not justified and spreading it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.950" end="00:37:58.069" style="s2">as if it were that is eaten of itself a</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.529" end="00:38:00.470" style="s2">problem so hear me very clearly even if</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.069" end="00:38:02.450" style="s2">it turns out that this virus jumped from</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.470" end="00:38:04.970" style="s2">the wild and got into the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.450" end="00:38:06.980" style="s2">population evolved the ability to jump</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.970" end="00:38:09.200" style="s2">from one person to the next and spread</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.980" end="00:38:12.619" style="s2">across the globe and the implication of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.200" end="00:38:14.630" style="s2">a lab leak is false even if that turns</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.619" end="00:38:17.450" style="s2">out to be the case the consensus that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.630" end="00:38:19.579" style="s2">scientists reached was not justified</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.450" end="00:38:21.829" style="s2">even if they turn out to have been right</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.579" end="00:38:24.799" style="s2">the consensus and their certainty around</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.829" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">it was not justified and that is in and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.799" end="00:38:29.779" style="s2">of itself an existential threat because</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.660" style="s2">we need the natural disagreement between</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.779" end="00:38:34.970" style="s2">scientists to tell us what possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.660" end="00:38:38.539" style="s2">surround us we don&#39;t need false</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.970" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">consensus we need frankness and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.539" end="00:38:44.450" style="s2">tough lesson but I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:53.029" style="s2">important one to remember anything to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.450" end="00:38:55.609" style="s2">add thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.029" end="00:38:57.410" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s see next one this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.609" end="00:38:59.779" style="s2">person just a comment they say a Chimera</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.410" end="00:39:03.410" style="s2">virus sounds scary downlighting of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.779" end="00:39:05.210" style="s2">downloading a virus is scary I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.410" end="00:39:07.250" style="s2">certainly agree the ability to download</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.210" end="00:39:10.009" style="s2">a sequence that we know is infectious</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.250" end="00:39:11.630" style="s2">and then effectively leave it on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.009" end="00:39:16.970" style="s2">honor system that no one will release it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.630" end="00:39:20.269" style="s2">that&#39;s a terrifying level of power right</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.970" end="00:39:27.230" style="s2">so today implied downloading being able</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.269" end="00:39:29.630" style="s2">to print DNA yep I think they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.230" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">from what you said that you could you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.630" end="00:39:34.759" style="s2">could get these things printed at a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:37.400" style="s2">of different locations you said</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.759" end="00:39:40.660" style="s2">something about there being places in</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.400" end="00:39:46.069" style="s2">China that would do it very cheaply I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.660" end="00:39:49.849" style="s2">mean it&#39;s definitely printing is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.069" end="00:39:52.339" style="s2">cheap but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like anybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.849" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">could do it you actually do biology lab</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.339" end="00:39:58.069" style="s2">you have to stitch those pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:40:00.349" style="s2">and put it in live culture I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.069" end="00:40:03.579" style="s2">could do it in the homeland garage don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.349" end="00:40:07.579" style="s2">get me wrong it doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.579" end="00:40:11.029" style="s2">different to setup from just a garage</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.579" end="00:40:14.180" style="s2">did do we do it yourself facility but</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.029" end="00:40:17.749" style="s2">hopefully if you&#39;re you know ordering</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.180" end="00:40:20.029" style="s2">virus parts online or through any kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.749" end="00:40:22.729" style="s2">of provider there is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.029" end="00:40:25.430" style="s2">screening process that sets off alarm</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.729" end="00:40:27.319" style="s2">bells you know you wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.430" end="00:40:32.469" style="s2">just like a bioterrorist wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.319" end="00:40:34.219" style="s2">good without anybody Authority the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.469" end="00:40:45.049" style="s2">tracking got down</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.219" end="00:40:47.180" style="s2">but state actors yeah you could so are</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.049" end="00:40:49.759" style="s2">you suggesting that at the moment those</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.180" end="00:40:52.549" style="s2">checks exist so that only a state level</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.759" end="00:41:01.219" style="s2">actor or something like it I know they</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.549" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">exist in the States if you were large</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.219" end="00:41:07.130" style="s2">enough fragment of any particular known</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:09.829" style="s2">pathogen yummy you could try to probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.130" end="00:41:13.130" style="s2">try to circumvent that if you tried but</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.829" end="00:41:16.309" style="s2">I think it specially after this pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.130" end="00:41:17.779" style="s2">there&#39;s very close watches and usually</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.309" end="00:41:19.309" style="s2">they&#39;re the people printing this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.779" end="00:41:23.180" style="s2">they they kind of know where this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.309" end="00:41:26.539" style="s2">coming have enough biology not knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.180" end="00:41:28.819" style="s2">few people doing wait a minute why does</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.539" end="00:41:31.719" style="s2">he need you know this particular class</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.819" end="00:41:37.519" style="s2">we printed this particular fragment</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.719" end="00:41:40.609" style="s2">anyway so on one level it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.519" end="00:41:42.289" style="s2">being kind of countered by various</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.609" end="00:41:42.739" style="s2">intelligence agencies at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.289" end="00:41:44.809" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.739" end="00:41:47.390" style="s2">on the other hand I think after this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.809" end="00:41:50.390" style="s2">pandemic as we alluded to an original</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.390" end="00:41:52.690" style="s2">podcast you might get like new entrants</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.390" end="00:41:57.019" style="s2">new terrorists like looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.690" end="00:42:01.240" style="s2">realizing how how easy it is why why</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.019" end="00:42:04.180" style="s2">kitchen impact they can have 4,000</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.240" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">Congress dollars yep then they hope not</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.180" end="00:42:08.950" style="s2">hopefully yeah I hope not too but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">really think hoping not it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.950" end="00:42:13.420" style="s2">what works is recognizing that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">danger is out there and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.420" end="00:42:19.630" style="s2">to make it inaccessible because you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.500" end="00:42:22.660" style="s2">the very nature of terrorists terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.630" end="00:42:26.050" style="s2">happens when people are not powerful</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.660" end="00:42:27.940" style="s2">enough to cause a change that they want</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.050" end="00:42:30.010" style="s2">to cause for whatever reason and so they</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.940" end="00:42:32.760" style="s2">seek some sort of power amplifier that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.010" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">functions through terror and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.760" end="00:42:39.220" style="s2">the relatively low price point for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:43.240" style="s2">huge amount of havoc that we now know as</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.220" end="00:42:46.119" style="s2">possible is certain to be attractive so</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.240" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">that means we have to be much more</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.119" end="00:42:51.430" style="s2">sophisticated about preventing this</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:55.390" style="s2">because sure it&#39;s going to be out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.430" end="00:42:58.900" style="s2">reach for people who are small-time</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.390" end="00:42:59.770" style="s2">enough but people whose interests are</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.900" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">not honorable</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.770" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">exist at every scale and we can&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:11.410" style="s2">to have this in reach for those with</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:13.570" style="s2">significant power and resources okay so</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.410" end="00:43:16.180" style="s2">next question is an interesting one I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.570" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">heard this one a number of times do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.180" end="00:43:19.570" style="s2">think it&#39;s worth finding out what</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">happened in China even if it ups</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.570" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">tensions between China and the US or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:27.970" style="s2">world this could have big implications</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:32.250" style="s2">on trade and geopolitics possibly even</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.970" end="00:43:36.010" style="s2">lead to Wars or proxy wars thanks Ben</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.250" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll start here I don&#39;t think we have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.010" end="00:43:45.430" style="s2">choice we cannot shield an investigation</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:48.850" style="s2">into the origins of a phenomenon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.430" end="00:43:50.940" style="s2">obviously putting a huge fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.850" end="00:43:53.980" style="s2">world&#39;s well-being in jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.940" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">irrespective of where is leads yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.980" end="00:44:00.520" style="s2">potentially going to lead to tensions</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:02.350" style="s2">between China and the US and the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.520" end="00:44:04.060" style="s2">the world on the other hand I think we</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.350" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">were very clear in our initial</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.060" end="00:44:10.090" style="s2">discussion that we don&#39;t really see this</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:12.070" style="s2">if the lab leak hypothesis is correct we</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.090" end="00:44:15.140" style="s2">don&#39;t see this as the responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.070" end="00:44:17.900" style="s2">China per se this is the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.140" end="00:44:20.569" style="s2">of the scientific community that decided</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.900" end="00:44:23.509" style="s2">that it was safe and desirable to engage</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.569" end="00:44:27.529" style="s2">in gain-of-function research on that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.509" end="00:44:31.789" style="s2">borne coronaviruses and as terrible as</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.529" end="00:44:34.700" style="s2">the outcome is I believe if the lab leak</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.789" end="00:44:37.519" style="s2">hypothesis is true as in the form that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.700" end="00:44:42.700" style="s2">we think it might well be true that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.519" end="00:44:46.039" style="s2">is an honest error a spectacular one but</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.700" end="00:44:50.059" style="s2">the blame is not what this is about so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.039" end="00:44:53.930" style="s2">am concerned that the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.059" end="00:44:56.180" style="s2">administration has sought as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.930" end="00:44:57.979" style="s2">has opened the possibility that this</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.180" end="00:45:00.019" style="s2">month at the lab leak hypothesis might</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.979" end="00:45:02.779" style="s2">be real it has also politicized that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.019" end="00:45:04.190" style="s2">claim and made it frankly much more</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.779" end="00:45:06.380" style="s2">difficult for those of us who wish to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.190" end="00:45:08.509" style="s2">careful about this because it is seen</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.380" end="00:45:11.150" style="s2">when one talks about this hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.509" end="00:45:13.369" style="s2">that they are on a political side which</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.150" end="00:45:15.979" style="s2">is not the case so I would advise us to</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.369" end="00:45:19.069" style="s2">solve the problem of geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.979" end="00:45:23.059" style="s2">tensions by being clear about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.069" end="00:45:25.009" style="s2">that this is a matter of great interest</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.059" end="00:45:26.809" style="s2">for humanity&#39;s well-being and that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.009" end="00:45:29.930" style="s2">requires us to figure out what happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.809" end="00:45:34.099" style="s2">it&#39;s not a matter of blame unless</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.930" end="00:45:36.650" style="s2">something truly unexpected happened here</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.099" end="00:45:38.449" style="s2">like this was an intentionally released</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.650" end="00:45:40.130" style="s2">bioweapon that would change this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.449" end="00:45:43.219" style="s2">quite a bit because this would obviously</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.130" end="00:45:45.069" style="s2">be an act of war but assuming that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.219" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">what happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.069" end="00:45:52.609" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s recognize that what appears</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:54.769" style="s2">possible and maybe likely here is an</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.609" end="00:45:56.299" style="s2">honest scientific mistake of spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.769" end="00:46:00.049" style="s2">proportions and it wouldn&#39;t be the first</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.299" end="00:46:03.529" style="s2">one right absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.049" end="00:46:08.660" style="s2">for example there&#39;s this 1937 flu</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.529" end="00:46:11.719" style="s2">pandemic h1n1 which I think the modern</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.660" end="00:46:15.140" style="s2">scientific consensus agrees now that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.719" end="00:46:17.269" style="s2">was a lab leak from China who have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.140" end="00:46:19.729" style="s2">working on some sort of vaccine for that</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.269" end="00:46:21.769" style="s2">strain which actually at that time was</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.729" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">already extinct extinct I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.769" end="00:46:26.580" style="s2">same strain that was the Spanish flu</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:29.070" style="s2">strain and maybe they were</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.580" end="00:46:31.230" style="s2">just in case returns trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.070" end="00:46:33.240" style="s2">vaccine which actually escaped the lab</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.230" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">and started an outbreak first in China</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.240" end="00:46:38.190" style="s2">and the Soviet Union around the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.350" style="s2">area and for many years it was taboo in</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.190" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">scientific circles to to even</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.350" end="00:46:44.400" style="s2">contemplate the idea that this could</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:46.650" style="s2">have been caused by a lab leak although</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.400" end="00:46:49.650" style="s2">there were whole works like temperature</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.650" end="00:46:51.390" style="s2">sensitivity of the this viral strain</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.650" end="00:46:54.540" style="s2">which is a hallmark of like vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.390" end="00:46:58.710" style="s2">attenuation and eventually I think many</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.540" end="00:47:00.120" style="s2">decades later it was then recognized and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.710" end="00:47:03.990" style="s2">acknowledged by the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.120" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">yeah sorry it was a lab leak I think we</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.990" end="00:47:09.540" style="s2">might have just very similar situation</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:12.590" style="s2">here where as you know in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.540" end="00:47:15.450" style="s2">future barring some you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.590" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">whistleblowers or unexpected evidence</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.450" end="00:47:21.690" style="s2">come out if the status quo remains</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2">nobody&#39;s gonna acknowledge this was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.690" end="00:47:27.180" style="s2">lab leak if it was or of course we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:29.400" style="s2">you know operating under the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.180" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">that this is a lab leak if later on we</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.400" end="00:47:35.970" style="s2">have evidence oh no actually this was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:39.830" style="s2">natural outbreak and we show evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.970" end="00:47:42.450" style="s2">these sonic animals or the intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.830" end="00:47:43.050" style="s2">carrier then of course this question is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.450" end="00:47:46.940" style="s2">off the table</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.050" end="00:47:51.120" style="s2">and it will just be proven wrong and eat</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.940" end="00:47:54.390" style="s2">whatever but if there was a lab leak I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.120" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">think were several years away if not</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.390" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">decades of actually the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:48:03.360" style="s2">consensus acknowledging it and the state</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.170" end="00:48:05.970" style="s2">the government&#39;s acknowledging as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.360" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">but it is interesting I think you looted</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.970" end="00:48:10.590" style="s2">is that the American government can</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.180" style="s2">stopped forcing the issue a few months</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.590" end="00:48:14.190" style="s2">back because they were pretty aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.180" end="00:48:17.130" style="s2">initially and then they kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.190" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">stopped stopped talking about and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.130" end="00:48:21.960" style="s2">they at that point they realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.290" end="00:48:24.450" style="s2">was a lab leak but was a leak of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.960" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">research paid for by American taxpayers</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.450" end="00:48:30.360" style="s2">so collaboration of American researchers</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:32.700" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not a very politically</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.360" end="00:48:34.200" style="s2">high dividend case to keep pushing so</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.700" end="00:48:34.860" style="s2">maybe they dropped it that&#39;s why we drop</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.200" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">the subject</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.860" end="00:48:39.180" style="s2">yeah I have the same sense that there</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:39.880" style="s2">was a recognition that a story that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.180" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">looked</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:45.819" style="s2">useful suddenly became so complicated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">terms of what it implied that there was</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.819" end="00:48:50.289" style="s2">a loss of enthusiasm on everybody&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">for talking about it which is really the</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.289" end="00:48:56.589" style="s2">reason that we have to pursue it now</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:59.470" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping is that somewhere out</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.589" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">there in the virality community there</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.470" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">are people who have the same sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.049" end="00:49:07.029" style="s2">we do that this story does not add up as</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:08.589" style="s2">a simple zone otic Jump doesn&#39;t mean it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.029" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen but so far we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.589" end="00:49:14.500" style="s2">enough pieces to see how it would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:16.269" style="s2">and lab leak would make good sense and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.500" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna look at each other across</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.269" end="00:49:23.740" style="s2">the table and say you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:26.289" style="s2">actually have an obligation to say what</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.740" end="00:49:29.019" style="s2">we understand is true and why it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.289" end="00:49:33.240" style="s2">suggests the map of probabilities that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.019" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">we see that would be highly desirable so</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.240" end="00:49:38.680" style="s2">hopefully hopefully they can hear how</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:40.089" style="s2">important it is that we need viral</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.680" end="00:49:43.180" style="s2">adjust to begin to rescue their</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.089" end="00:49:46.119" style="s2">credibility by telling us what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:48.039" style="s2">yet know about this story hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.119" end="00:49:49.720" style="s2">will happen I really I really do think</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.039" end="00:49:54.849" style="s2">it&#39;s possible and I should say there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.720" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">a few courageous people in virology who</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.849" end="00:50:05.170" style="s2">have very carefully indicated that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:08.230" style="s2">possibility is alive and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.170" end="00:50:11.380" style="s2">hopeful sign so maybe we&#39;ll see more of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.230" end="00:50:12.970" style="s2">that as people realize that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.380" end="00:50:20.019" style="s2">question is not going to go away until</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.970" end="00:50:21.160" style="s2">it&#39;s settled all right thanks for doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.019" end="00:50:22.509" style="s2">this it&#39;s unacceptable that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.160" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">scientific community is so dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.509" end="00:50:27.759" style="s2">totally agree DNA research has come a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:30.579" style="s2">long way since I was reading black and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.759" end="00:50:34.180" style="s2">gray rectangles on an x-ray film you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.579" end="00:50:38.349" style="s2">better believe it I have to say I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.180" end="00:50:40.990" style="s2">old enough and I studied biology in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.349" end="00:50:43.630" style="s2">college long enough ago that I have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.990" end="00:50:45.579" style="s2">same sense of it&#39;s amazing how far we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.630" end="00:50:48.700" style="s2">come and I guess the other thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.579" end="00:50:50.789" style="s2">say on that point is these things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.700" end="00:50:54.069" style="s2">the rate of change is not consistent</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.789" end="00:50:55.779" style="s2">fields get stuck they don&#39;t make very</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.069" end="00:50:57.069" style="s2">interesting progress for long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.779" end="00:51:00.450" style="s2">time and then suddenly they take a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.069" end="00:51:02.890" style="s2">quantum leap and so if you check back in</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.450" end="00:51:05.829" style="s2">haphazardly sometimes you discover a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.890" end="00:51:07.329" style="s2">field that was sleepy has made a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.829" end="00:51:11.230" style="s2">progress and this is part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.329" end="00:51:13.869" style="s2">that I said in our last discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.230" end="00:51:15.519" style="s2">I wanted a list of all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.869" end="00:51:17.319" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that are dangerous that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.519" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">don&#39;t yet know we&#39;re up to that I know</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.319" end="00:51:21.099" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna find out about after the</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:23.490" style="s2">accident has already happened the list</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.099" end="00:51:28.059" style="s2">of times that this has occurred since</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.490" end="00:51:29.470" style="s2">2008 is long and I want to know what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.550" end="00:53:13.220" style="s2">amount of power is potentially very</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.930" end="00:53:16.390" style="s2">protective for humans and the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.220" end="00:53:21.290" style="s2">argument against it is that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.390" end="00:53:24.050" style="s2">control the we cannot control the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.290" end="00:53:25.700" style="s2">substances that we have enhanced from</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.050" end="00:53:27.830" style="s2">the possibility of escape but of course</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.700" end="00:53:32.090" style="s2">humans are very capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.830" end="00:53:34.220" style="s2">remarkable things and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.090" end="00:53:36.920" style="s2">to prevent an infectious particle from</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.220" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">getting out of a laboratory while it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.920" end="00:53:40.609" style="s2">a difficult problem is not an unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:42.560" style="s2">problem that would be the steal man</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.609" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">argument I think now the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.560" end="00:53:47.869" style="s2">actually that there is a related rates</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:49.700" style="s2">problem and the more of these enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.869" end="00:53:52.100" style="s2">viruses we produce the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.700" end="00:53:56.420" style="s2">chances that one will escape and because</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.100" end="00:53:59.750" style="s2">the ingredient that you cannot eliminate</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.420" end="00:54:01.550" style="s2">from the mix is human beings who at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.750" end="00:54:03.500" style="s2">moment are absolutely required at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.550" end="00:54:05.660" style="s2">laboratory to do the work you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.500" end="00:54:07.580" style="s2">eliminate human error and if you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.660" end="00:54:10.460" style="s2">eliminate human error and people have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.580" end="00:54:12.350" style="s2">go home to sleep and to eat and to all</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.460" end="00:54:15.800" style="s2">the things that human beings do when</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.800" end="00:54:21.020" style="s2">a leak so it may be that the chances of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.350" end="00:54:25.220" style="s2">creating a pandemic simply outstrip the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.020" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">chances of preventing one if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.220" end="00:54:30.080" style="s2">to do this research I will say as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:31.320" style="s2">final piece I did suggest in a prior</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.080" end="00:54:33.630" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.320" end="00:54:35.370" style="s2">that if you were going to insist on</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.630" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">doing this research and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.370" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">that we need to do this research I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:43.640" style="s2">it may be the best defense maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:47.660" style="s2">limiting unnecessary and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.640" end="00:54:50.550" style="s2">contact with wildlife but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.660" end="00:54:52.910" style="s2">hell-bent on doing this research then</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.550" end="00:54:55.890" style="s2">maybe you should be doing it on a ship</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.910" end="00:54:59.550" style="s2">right out at sea a fit that when</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.890" end="00:55:01.650" style="s2">something escapes can be quarantined</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.550" end="00:55:04.440" style="s2">from the rest of the world so that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.650" end="00:55:06.660" style="s2">don&#39;t run into this problem again and if</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.440" end="00:55:08.070" style="s2">you think that&#39;s too much hassle then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.660" end="00:55:16.950" style="s2">think you have it understood how much</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.070" end="00:55:19.740" style="s2">danger we&#39;re putting ourselves in long</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.950" end="00:55:22.320" style="s2">expeditions don&#39;t go out and study some</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.740" end="00:55:27.150" style="s2">marine life and you can to join</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.320" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">expedition with isolated bsl-4 based on</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.150" end="00:55:32.730" style="s2">three facility on that ship I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:34.650" style="s2">definitely gonna decrease the number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.730" end="00:55:37.470" style="s2">people willing to do this research oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.650" end="00:55:40.830" style="s2">yeah nobody snuck ownership for a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.470" end="00:55:42.600" style="s2">months but but if the argument yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.830" end="00:55:44.670" style="s2">the argument is that we have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.600" end="00:55:46.760" style="s2">research then how much do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.670" end="00:55:49.610" style="s2">pay somebody to live on a ship to do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.760" end="00:55:52.650" style="s2">sorry I didn&#39;t mean to interrupt you</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.610" end="00:55:54.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a good point I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.650" end="00:55:58.710" style="s2">subscribe to that argument I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.330" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">really see the does this logic that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.710" end="00:56:04.050" style="s2">have we are gating again actually from</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:08.940" style="s2">this function research excuse the pun</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.050" end="00:56:12.060" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.940" end="00:56:15.240" style="s2">what predict a pandemic by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.060" end="00:56:16.920" style="s2">recreate in a lab one of the trillions</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.240" end="00:56:20.130" style="s2">of mutations that might or might not</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.920" end="00:56:25.890" style="s2">happen in nature and then and then do</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.130" end="00:56:27.390" style="s2">what we create as the black lab and</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.890" end="00:56:33.150" style="s2">other labs are trying to do Panther the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.390" end="00:56:35.520" style="s2">virus vaccine or to the punic well first</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.150" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">of all I don&#39;t know IFIF the numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.520" end="00:56:39.870" style="s2">in in our favor because we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:41.880" style="s2">obviously recreate all the mutations</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.870" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">that are my possible in nature might be</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.880" end="00:56:45.240" style="s2">possible in nature that might actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:49.230" style="s2">jump over into human</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.240" end="00:56:52.230" style="s2">and trying to do so I think creates</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.230" end="00:56:55.160" style="s2">higher risk of having it in a lab rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.230" end="00:56:59.060" style="s2">than actually being able to prevent it</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.160" end="00:57:03.210" style="s2">by using this approach and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.060" end="00:57:04.530" style="s2">obviously well in this case we did get a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.210" end="00:57:06.690" style="s2">functionary so if you didn&#39;t help us</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.530" end="00:57:10.380" style="s2">come up with any Panther in the virus</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.690" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">vaccine a therapeutic in time which I</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.380" end="00:57:18.060" style="s2">think they worked on 10 years maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:20.190" style="s2">so and again you probably don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.060" end="00:57:23.070" style="s2">need gain-of-function research to work</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.190" end="00:57:25.110" style="s2">on a panther a virus vaccine you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.070" end="00:57:28.250" style="s2">just take the existing known strains and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.110" end="00:57:32.730" style="s2">work on those rather than trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.250" end="00:57:34.260" style="s2">so yeah I agree I agree with all of what</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.730" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve said and I would add a couple</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.260" end="00:57:43.320" style="s2">things one if it turns out to be a lab</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:45.630" style="s2">leak then we know that the very people</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.320" end="00:57:47.790" style="s2">who were telling us that we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.630" end="00:57:49.710" style="s2">educate ourselves about what an enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.790" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">virus could and would do because that</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.710" end="00:57:53.370" style="s2">would be protective when it came down to</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:57:55.610" style="s2">it didn&#39;t tell us what they had learned</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.370" end="00:57:58.650" style="s2">in other words as I&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.610" end="00:58:01.950" style="s2">repeatedly part of what may be going on</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.650" end="00:58:03.930" style="s2">here is that this virus is adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.950" end="00:58:05.580" style="s2">laboratory conditions some of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.930" end="00:58:08.490" style="s2">intentionally imposed and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.580" end="00:58:10.380" style="s2">quite accidental so if it is true that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.490" end="00:58:12.660" style="s2">this research is supposed to armed us</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.380" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">with knowledge in order to better</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.660" end="00:58:16.590" style="s2">protect ourselves but the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:18.300" style="s2">isn&#39;t forthcoming at the point that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.590" end="00:58:21.330" style="s2">thing escapes the lab then that would</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.300" end="00:58:24.540" style="s2">suggest that the whole thing was a waste</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.330" end="00:58:26.220" style="s2">so that logic doesn&#39;t apply if this</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.540" end="00:58:27.420" style="s2">truly didn&#39;t come from a lab but if it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.220" end="00:58:29.490" style="s2">did I think we have to look very</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.420" end="00:58:33.930" style="s2">carefully at it the last thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.490" end="00:58:38.280" style="s2">say is as a bat biologist I worked for</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.930" end="00:58:40.050" style="s2">years with bats I captured them I glued</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.280" end="00:58:43.410" style="s2">transmitters on them I followed them</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.050" end="00:58:46.740" style="s2">around the forest and at the time it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.410" end="00:58:48.690" style="s2">not well understood that there were</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.740" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">these very dangerous viruses that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.690" end="00:58:52.890" style="s2">might be coming in close contact with</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:55.080" style="s2">now the reason that I mentioned this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.890" end="00:58:57.690" style="s2">that I was not alone in doing this kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.080" end="00:58:58.800" style="s2">of work there are tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.690" end="00:59:02.790" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.800" end="00:59:07.590" style="s2">wild creatures handling them and there</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.790" end="00:59:09.780" style="s2">is a famous instance of a fungus that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.590" end="00:59:11.460" style="s2">being transmitted to amphibians the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.780" end="00:59:12.030" style="s2">danger didn&#39;t go to humans it went to an</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.460" end="00:59:16.530" style="s2">fib ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.030" end="00:59:18.330" style="s2">through humans but it is not the case</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.530" end="00:59:21.210" style="s2">that all of these people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.330" end="00:59:24.110" style="s2">on an indefinitely large number of</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.210" end="00:59:27.210" style="s2">species in the wild are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.110" end="00:59:30.600" style="s2">creating zoonotic pandemics could it</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.210" end="00:59:31.710" style="s2">happen sure but I think what those who</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.600" end="00:59:34.860" style="s2">are arguing that we need</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.710" end="00:59:36.870" style="s2">gain-of-function research to address the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.860" end="00:59:39.360" style="s2">possibility of a zoonotic jump are</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.870" end="00:59:43.920" style="s2">ignoring is that human contact with</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.360" end="00:59:47.910" style="s2">wildlife is very ancient and very</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.920" end="00:59:50.280" style="s2">widespread we have lots of diseases that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.910" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">have jumped through agriculture for</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.280" end="00:59:56.340" style="s2">example but it may be much less</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:58.590" style="s2">dangerous having casual contact with</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.340" end="00:59:59.340" style="s2">animals in the wild than we are being</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.590" end="01:00:02.280" style="s2">led to believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.340" end="01:00:06.510" style="s2">and the real protection probably comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.280" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">from preventing intense contact like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.510" end="01:00:09.600" style="s2">butchering of wild animals the</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">butchering of wild animals obviously</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.600" end="01:00:15.900" style="s2">exposes people to bodily fluids of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:18.600" style="s2">animals and that is a very high</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.900" end="01:00:20.250" style="s2">likelihood of something jumping which</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.600" end="01:00:22.050" style="s2">still doesn&#39;t make for a pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.250" end="01:00:24.840" style="s2">because in general if something jumps in</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.400" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">but you know we have hiv/aids which we</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:41.160" style="s2">one butchered in the bush meat trade so</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.330" end="01:00:43.740" style="s2">that&#39;s a major indication that bush meat</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.160" end="01:00:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s not such a hot idea but the amount</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.740" end="01:00:47.640" style="s2">of contact is high already</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.210" end="01:00:49.500" style="s2">the number of zoonotic jumps that have</p>

<p begin="01:01:12.450" end="01:01:26.130" style="s2">is much safer than it actually is okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.829" end="01:01:30.060" style="s2">all right we are at one hour let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.130" end="01:01:33.450" style="s2">through some more of these questions all</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.060" end="01:01:35.160" style="s2">right here&#39;s our just oh sure add a</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.450" end="01:01:37.230" style="s2">final note to that question I think you</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.160" end="01:01:40.619" style="s2">were referring to Peter - like who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.230" end="01:01:43.140" style="s2">trying to make a case that these jumps</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.619" end="01:01:48.230" style="s2">happen in regular basis and I was using</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.140" end="01:01:52.320" style="s2">one of his flawed papers where they saw</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.230" end="01:01:54.240" style="s2">six farmers being affected not affected</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.320" end="01:01:57.810" style="s2">to carry antibodies for particular</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.240" end="01:02:00.030" style="s2">strain of that kernel virus I like 218</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.810" end="01:02:02.369" style="s2">people to justify his number yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.030" end="01:02:04.260" style="s2">like a million to seven million farmers</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.369" end="01:02:08.630" style="s2">in Southeast Asia were exposed to these</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.260" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">zoning jumps but and I think yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.630" end="01:02:16.109" style="s2">really correct and finally I think as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">mentioned in the original broadcast or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.109" end="01:02:19.619" style="s2">signage I think it&#39;s a much better way</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">to spend the money spent on</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.619" end="01:02:25.530" style="s2">gain-of-function research to spend it on</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:27.480" style="s2">tracing of various editing outbreaks</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.530" end="01:02:29.609" style="s2">that happened I will cross the world to</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.480" end="01:02:31.849" style="s2">be able to very quickly identify such</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.609" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">epidemics and these days the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.849" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">full genomic sequencing you know you</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:39.390" style="s2">could sequence the virus viral strain</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:42.060" style="s2">pretty cheaply and pretty quickly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.390" end="01:02:43.770" style="s2">so cheap now that you know whereas it</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.060" end="01:02:45.869" style="s2">wasn&#39;t ten years ago so ten years ago</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.770" end="01:02:47.970" style="s2">you could you know make any case that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.869" end="01:02:49.740" style="s2">need to be prepared but these days we</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.970" end="01:02:52.470" style="s2">can actually very quickly in real time</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.740" end="01:02:54.180" style="s2">find what exactly is causing a small</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.470" end="01:02:57.170" style="s2">outbreak a big outbreak and you can get</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.180" end="01:03:00.300" style="s2">the genomic sequences of all the virus</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.170" end="01:03:02.520" style="s2">viruses making a new appearance or</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.300" end="01:03:04.890" style="s2">confirming this is a new virus it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.520" end="01:03:07.020" style="s2">new outbreak where this is like no same</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.890" end="01:03:09.150" style="s2">seasonal kernel i restrain or influenza</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.020" end="01:03:11.430" style="s2">strain pretty quickly pretty chick with</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.150" end="01:03:13.050" style="s2">cheap weight or a very distributed scale</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.430" end="01:03:15.589" style="s2">all across the world and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.050" end="01:03:20.220" style="s2">what we need to invest as the global</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.589" end="01:03:22.230" style="s2">society into at this point much better I</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.220" end="01:03:25.360" style="s2">think will give us much better outcome</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.230" end="01:03:27.670" style="s2">get a functional research yeah III</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.360" end="01:03:31.450" style="s2">at that point and I guess I would add a</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.670" end="01:03:34.420" style="s2">couple things one I think we need some</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.450" end="01:03:37.690" style="s2">better language the idea that is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.420" end="01:03:40.140" style="s2">attic jump is a massive danger is really</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.690" end="01:03:42.580" style="s2">covering the fact that this is two steps</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.140" end="01:03:45.220" style="s2">synodic jumps probably do happen</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.580" end="01:03:48.910" style="s2">regularly is it not attempts that catch</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.220" end="01:03:50.890" style="s2">on that after they have jumped make the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.910" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">evolutionary discoveries that allow them</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.890" end="01:03:56.680" style="s2">to spread across a large population</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:59.140" style="s2">that&#39;s probably very rare and so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.680" end="01:04:01.780" style="s2">I think dividing those two things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.140" end="01:04:04.780" style="s2">figuring out actually probabilistically</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.780" end="01:04:07.870" style="s2">where is the place to prevent this right</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.780" end="01:04:11.080" style="s2">it would be a better investment and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.870" end="01:04:13.450" style="s2">the other thing I would say which this</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.080" end="01:04:16.510" style="s2">has just become very clear in my mind is</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.450" end="01:04:20.530" style="s2">that part of the problem is that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.510" end="01:04:23.020" style="s2">don&#39;t take normal regular pathogens that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.530" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">we&#39;re familiar with nearly seriously</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.020" end="01:04:30.040" style="s2">enough and that there is a lot we can do</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:32.020" style="s2">monitoring the circulation of pathogens</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.040" end="01:04:34.600" style="s2">and interfering with their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.020" end="01:04:38.050" style="s2">jump between people that we&#39;ve only just</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.600" end="01:04:40.900" style="s2">begun discussing in the context of kovat</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.050" end="01:04:43.810" style="s2">19 and so I would advocate that we got</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.900" end="01:04:46.180" style="s2">smarter about how not to transmit</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.810" end="01:04:51.310" style="s2">pathogens to each other you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.180" end="01:04:53.350" style="s2">same way that hygiene greatly increased</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.310" end="01:04:54.790" style="s2">our resistance to things because we just</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.350" end="01:04:56.080" style="s2">figured out how they were spreading and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.790" end="01:04:57.850" style="s2">it figured out how to stop doing it we</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.080" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">now have technologies at our disposal</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.850" end="01:05:02.620" style="s2">that would allow us to prevent this from</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:04.270" style="s2">happening in all sorts of context where</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.620" end="01:05:07.060" style="s2">we are actually inflicting it on ourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.270" end="01:05:08.650" style="s2">like our HVAC systems right we could</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.060" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">design HVAC systems that are excellent</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.650" end="01:05:12.760" style="s2">at clearing viruses from buildings at</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:16.360" style="s2">the moment lots of them just spread</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.760" end="01:05:18.760" style="s2">these things around buildings so so</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.360" end="01:05:20.530" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s lots of room to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.760" end="01:05:22.420" style="s2">humanity safer and better that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.530" end="01:05:29.710" style="s2">require this high wire act of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.420" end="01:05:32.140" style="s2">gain-of-function research all right next</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.710" end="01:05:35.470" style="s2">question have you interviewed a</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.140" end="01:05:37.569" style="s2">virologist or other expert and they</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.470" end="01:05:41.049" style="s2">suggest a Lena Chan</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.569" end="01:05:46.449" style="s2">a couple other people I would gladly</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.049" end="01:05:51.099" style="s2">have a virologist on I&#39;m a fan at a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.449" end="01:05:55.209" style="s2">distance of dr. Chan&#39;s work I would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.099" end="01:05:57.969" style="s2">in the current environment there is I</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.209" end="01:06:00.369" style="s2">think likely to be concern even amongst</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.680" end="01:08:44.049" style="s2">especially in light of the absence of</p>

<p begin="01:12:28.809" end="01:12:33.010" style="s2">international biologists support an</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.989" end="01:12:37.719" style="s2">investigation which i think is the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.010" end="01:12:39.909" style="s2">question in some sense I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.719" end="01:12:43.750" style="s2">something very nasty I&#39;ve seen it from</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.909" end="01:12:45.699" style="s2">the inside and this is a major threat to</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.699" end="01:12:51.699" style="s2">scientific matters the problem is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.289" end="01:12:54.309" style="s2">scientists have been turned into</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.699" end="01:12:57.369" style="s2">salesmen in order to get your research</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.309" end="01:13:00.190" style="s2">funded you have to portray it in a light</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.369" end="01:13:02.440" style="s2">that it is very important and that</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.190" end="01:13:05.440" style="s2">you&#39;re in the best position to do it and</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.440" end="01:13:07.300" style="s2">you end up saying a lot of things in</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.440" end="01:13:09.280" style="s2">order to get your grant funded that</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.300" end="01:13:10.929" style="s2">actually an objective analysis probably</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.280" end="01:13:12.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t support and then you have these</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.929" end="01:13:15.250" style="s2">little networks of people most people</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.880" end="01:13:16.599" style="s2">cannot evaluate a grant by a viral</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.250" end="01:13:18.849" style="s2">adjust about gain-of-function research</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.599" end="01:13:21.369" style="s2">so the people who are doing the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.849" end="01:13:24.159" style="s2">of the of the claims are involved in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.369" end="01:13:26.500" style="s2">same work so a they&#39;re predisposed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.159" end="01:13:29.320" style="s2">see the work as similarly important and</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.500" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">belittle reciprocity networks develop</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.320" end="01:13:33.820" style="s2">and so people are funding each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:36.099" style="s2">grants and supporting their claims and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.820" end="01:13:37.690" style="s2">what it results in is science that is</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.099" end="01:13:40.659" style="s2">increasingly just disconnected from</p>

<p begin="01:13:42.699" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">really dangerous because the people who</p>

<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:50.860" style="s2">that have a conflict of interest so what</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.789" end="01:13:52.929" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is what happens when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.860" end="01:13:54.969" style="s2">don&#39;t protect science from conflicts of</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.929" end="01:13:57.400" style="s2">interest the most important thing that a</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.969" end="01:13:59.860" style="s2">scientist can have is the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.400" end="01:14:01.179" style="s2">tell you what&#39;s actually going on even</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.860" end="01:14:04.300" style="s2">when it isn&#39;t good for them to say so</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.179" end="01:14:05.849" style="s2">that is a vital capacity and we are</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.300" end="01:14:11.550" style="s2">destroying it by</p>

<p begin="01:14:13.889" end="01:14:20.630" style="s2">closely connected to science and it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.380" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">turning our scientists into huxter&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.630" end="01:14:27.020" style="s2">we gotta cut it out I mean what has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:27.020" style="s2">happen in order for us to see the danger</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.199" end="01:14:32.000" style="s2">yes it&#39;s a great point for all of</p>

<p begin="01:15:49.349" end="01:15:54.750" style="s2">to be honest and to be you know not</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.530" end="01:15:57.630" style="s2">afraid to to challenge the group think</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.750" end="01:16:02.159" style="s2">that sometimes it&#39;s very present in some</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.630" end="01:16:04.230" style="s2">fields absolutely ok next question is it</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.159" end="01:16:06.329" style="s2">possible that the Chinese themselves did</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.230" end="01:16:09.380" style="s2">not know initially that it had leaked</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.329" end="01:16:14.040" style="s2">you&#39;d think they would have acted sooner</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.380" end="01:16:16.110" style="s2">now my my sense is I&#39;m not sure what I</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.040" end="01:16:17.940" style="s2">would expect them to do because you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.110" end="01:16:19.469" style="s2">to think about what these things look</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.940" end="01:16:23.750" style="s2">like as they emerge</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.469" end="01:16:27.030" style="s2">right you get some cluster of pneumonias</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.750" end="01:16:30.030" style="s2">maybe somebody in a hospital thinks is</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.030" end="01:16:31.410" style="s2">there something going on but maybe 3/4</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.030" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">of the time that somebody says is there</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.410" end="01:16:36.060" style="s2">something going on it doesn&#39;t go any</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:38.640" style="s2">farther than that or it turns out to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.060" end="01:16:43.050" style="s2">just an anomalous cluster of cases that</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.640" end="01:16:46.440" style="s2">are unrelated right and then in order to</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.050" end="01:16:48.900" style="s2">test so how often do you want a doctor</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.440" end="01:16:50.969" style="s2">who thinks am i seeing an unusual</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.900" end="01:16:52.620" style="s2">phenomenon here that could be an</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.969" end="01:16:55.920" style="s2">outbreak of something new how often do</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.620" end="01:16:58.110" style="s2">you want that to trigger a search for a</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.920" end="01:17:01.050" style="s2">viral particle that might be causing it</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.110" end="01:17:02.840" style="s2">and then from there let&#39;s say okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.050" end="01:17:05.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a spate of men ammonia&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.840" end="01:17:07.440" style="s2">then you find a viral particle you</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.100" end="01:17:09.390" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen before are the two</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.440" end="01:17:12.120" style="s2">connected that&#39;s a difficult piece of</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.390" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">research to do right there so I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.120" end="01:17:17.670" style="s2">the point is that there are so many</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:21.860" style="s2">steps in establishing what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.670" end="01:17:26.820" style="s2">before you pull the the emergency break</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.860" end="01:17:29.730" style="s2">that you don&#39;t necessarily want every</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.820" end="01:17:32.160" style="s2">time some cluster of something emerges</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.730" end="01:17:35.190" style="s2">for the emergency brake on global travel</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.160" end="01:17:38.460" style="s2">to be pulled for example right we we set</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.190" end="01:17:40.469" style="s2">the bar somewhere else because if we did</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.460" end="01:17:42.540" style="s2">that then we&#39;d be pulling the emergency</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.469" end="01:17:44.760" style="s2">brake all the time and it would be for</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.540" end="01:17:48.120" style="s2">nothing so I don&#39;t know what this looked</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.760" end="01:17:50.160" style="s2">like inside of China I know that in</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.120" end="01:17:53.070" style="s2">retrospect and from the outside it looks</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.160" end="01:17:54.090" style="s2">like they moved way too late and I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.070" end="01:17:58.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to hold them responsible</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.090" end="01:18:00.989" style="s2">for in that regard but if you were in</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.290" end="01:18:03.060" style="s2">charge of building a system for figuring</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.989" end="01:18:05.790" style="s2">out you know when to pull the emergency</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.060" end="01:18:08.850" style="s2">brake and what to do next</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.790" end="01:18:11.250" style="s2">I think you&#39;d begin to recognize how</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.850" end="01:18:15.300" style="s2">complex a problem that actually is and</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.250" end="01:18:17.190" style="s2">this is where being proactive and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.300" end="01:18:20.670" style="s2">creating an environment in which things</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.190" end="01:18:22.830" style="s2">are less primed to spread would probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.670" end="01:18:26.010" style="s2">be a wiser investment I&#39;m very curious</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.830" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">to hear what you think about that area</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.010" end="01:18:33.180" style="s2">I think I agree with most of the points</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:35.100" style="s2">probably everything you said kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.180" end="01:18:37.830" style="s2">back to the original question I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.100" end="01:18:38.550" style="s2">it&#39;s very possible that yes the Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.830" end="01:18:40.290" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.550" end="01:18:41.550" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s some higher level of Chinese</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.290" end="01:18:44.850" style="s2">government themselves they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.550" end="01:18:47.730" style="s2">realize what had happened and maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.850" end="01:18:49.770" style="s2">were misled by kind of the local</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.730" end="01:18:51.570" style="s2">government because we we kind of know</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.770" end="01:18:53.340" style="s2">that the local woman government was</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.570" end="01:18:55.530" style="s2">denying there was any kind of outbreak</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.340" end="01:18:57.360" style="s2">and then the Beijing had to actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.530" end="01:19:00.330" style="s2">step in and I think that actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.360" end="01:19:04.980" style="s2">removed some of the local leaders and</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.330" end="01:19:07.620" style="s2">reprimanded others and initially I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.980" end="01:19:09.840" style="s2">it was the idea of the local government</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.620" end="01:19:12.180" style="s2">to kind of quell down all the mention of</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:15.870" style="s2">the potential human outbreak it was the</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.180" end="01:19:19.440" style="s2">local authorities who were I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.870" end="01:19:21.740" style="s2">targeting that dr. Lee I think the the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:24.290" style="s2">whistleblower the initial person who</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.740" end="01:19:27.570" style="s2">blew the whistle in the morning is in</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.290" end="01:19:30.980" style="s2">WeChat let her actually succumb to SARS</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.570" end="01:19:34.860" style="s2">cough - but then kind of the the big</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.980" end="01:19:37.770" style="s2">federal government stepped in and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.860" end="01:19:40.110" style="s2">they were already painted in a corner</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.770" end="01:19:41.760" style="s2">where they couldn&#39;t really admit even if</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.110" end="01:19:43.740" style="s2">there was a lab leak hypothesis they</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.760" end="01:19:45.930" style="s2">couldn&#39;t admit and there was one because</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.740" end="01:19:49.770" style="s2">you know saving face or whatever but</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.930" end="01:19:51.900" style="s2">they initially were it&#39;s highly possible</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.770" end="01:19:54.150" style="s2">they were misled by local authorities</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.900" end="01:19:56.520" style="s2">and the actions of the federal</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.150" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">government kind of hint that they were</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.520" end="01:20:02.160" style="s2">extremely unhappy with the handling of</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:04.500" style="s2">what the local government did and/or the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.160" end="01:20:06.540" style="s2">management of the Wuhan instead of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.500" end="01:20:08.910" style="s2">Radiology precisely because they</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.540" end="01:20:11.160" style="s2">instituted this Major General Chan as</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.910" end="01:20:14.640" style="s2">the head of the biology who is she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.160" end="01:20:16.440" style="s2">military biologist and she overtook the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.640" end="01:20:18.720" style="s2">leadership of the of the Warren</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.440" end="01:20:20.400" style="s2">Institute I think that&#39;s a big red flag</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.720" end="01:20:22.350" style="s2">that kind of the government the Beijing</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:25.230" style="s2">government was very unhappy with what</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.350" end="01:20:29.430" style="s2">had gone on or how it was handled in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.230" end="01:20:32.610" style="s2">lab how the previous work was handled or</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.430" end="01:20:34.440" style="s2">how they our break was portrayed or data</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.610" end="01:20:36.990" style="s2">was shared with the world or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.440" end="01:20:39.420" style="s2">but obviously the actions that they took</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.990" end="01:20:44.460" style="s2">the Chinese federal government I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.420" end="01:20:50.160" style="s2">indicative of unhappiness so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.460" end="01:20:52.530" style="s2">think we address this this question yep</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.160" end="01:20:53.730" style="s2">of course we don&#39;t know any potential</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.530" end="01:20:57.450" style="s2">potential deeper details</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.730" end="01:21:01.070" style="s2">only time will tell yep boy I wouldn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.450" end="01:21:01.070" style="s2">little bit of transparency be wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.340" end="01:21:06.600" style="s2">even yeah sorry and like not to deliver</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.710" end="01:21:08.700" style="s2">the point but the the thing that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.600" end="01:21:10.620" style="s2">did close who hand they still allow the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.700" end="01:21:12.390" style="s2">Chinese in your celebrations to go on</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.620" end="01:21:14.040" style="s2">even though it was I think at that point</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.390" end="01:21:17.100" style="s2">pretty clear that there&#39;s something bad</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.040" end="01:21:20.670" style="s2">going on that&#39;s a big big Mis mistake I</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.100" end="01:21:22.800" style="s2">think for both local and the federal</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.670" end="01:21:28.620" style="s2">government which is probably costing you</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.800" end="01:21:30.630" style="s2">want lives you know fine sighs well</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.620" end="01:21:32.280" style="s2">hindsight is apparently not 20/20</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.630" end="01:21:34.140" style="s2">because we&#39;re in the midst of making the</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.280" end="01:21:38.070" style="s2">very same mistake here in the US where</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.140" end="01:21:44.640" style="s2">we have suddenly decided that some</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.070" end="01:21:46.620" style="s2">groups are creating a a hazard of viral</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.640" end="01:21:51.950" style="s2">spread by protesting and other groups</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.620" end="01:21:54.810" style="s2">are not which is a very odd situation so</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.950" end="01:21:58.350" style="s2">as we yeah I saw this kind of one</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.810" end="01:21:59.730" style="s2">California County saying that big</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.350" end="01:22:01.650" style="s2">gatherings are limited to ten people</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.730" end="01:22:05.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a protest and 100 is alone</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.650" end="01:22:07.410" style="s2">something like completely illogical well</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.490" end="01:22:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s even worse than that</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.410" end="01:22:12.870" style="s2">it depends what you&#39;re protesting is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.450" end="01:22:15.900" style="s2">problem and that there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.870" end="01:22:17.490" style="s2">argument for this so I agree obviously a</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.900" end="01:22:19.590" style="s2">gathering of more than ten people if</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.490" end="01:22:21.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a protest doesn&#39;t make it any safer</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.590" end="01:22:23.550" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how safe it actually is</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.720" end="01:22:26.580" style="s2">because as we&#39;ve talked about before it</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.550" end="01:22:28.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to spread outdoors as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.580" end="01:22:30.000" style="s2">also mentioned before I predict that</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.170" end="01:22:31.440" style="s2">that will change and it will get it will</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.000" end="01:22:33.180" style="s2">evolve to be better at spreading</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.440" end="01:22:35.280" style="s2">outdoors so we should be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.180" end="01:22:38.550" style="s2">about things like large gatherings but</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.280" end="01:22:41.160" style="s2">the political double standard in terms</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.550" end="01:22:44.480" style="s2">of who we&#39;re going to shame for</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.160" end="01:22:48.720" style="s2">protesting in the midst of a pandemic is</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.480" end="01:22:54.370" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of mind-blowing to see it</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.720" end="01:22:57.790" style="s2">all right hmm what can we do to clear</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.370" end="01:23:01.210" style="s2">yeah go ahead sorry in terms of maybe</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.790" end="01:23:03.690" style="s2">not learning the lessons many countries</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.210" end="01:23:08.350" style="s2">are probably opening up too early</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.690" end="01:23:10.450" style="s2">including Russia probably or well in at</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.350" end="01:23:13.540" style="s2">least Moscow because Russia is very</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.450" end="01:23:16.150" style="s2">heterogeneous in different places some</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.540" end="01:23:17.380" style="s2">places didn&#39;t have any anybody six so</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.150" end="01:23:17.830" style="s2">they didn&#39;t even have a quarantine but</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.380" end="01:23:20.650" style="s2">Russia</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.830" end="01:23:23.890" style="s2">I mean Moscow had I think it was like</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.650" end="01:23:26.320" style="s2">almost 300,000 people infected but</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.890" end="01:23:28.900" style="s2">Moscow completely lifted all travelers</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.320" end="01:23:30.460" style="s2">crucial restrictions last week and now</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.900" end="01:23:32.710" style="s2">they were actually opening up some</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.460" end="01:23:34.930" style="s2">outdoor cafes and restaurants and next</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.710" end="01:23:37.330" style="s2">week they go to fully open all</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.930" end="01:23:39.250" style="s2">restaurants and maybe it&#39;s a bit too</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.330" end="01:23:42.400" style="s2">early because we still get like 1500</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.250" end="01:23:44.740" style="s2">daily new infected in Moscow whereas you</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.400" end="01:23:48.850" style="s2">here in Beijing and I think they had</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.740" end="01:23:50.710" style="s2">some traces of kovat of stars to in in a</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.850" end="01:23:54.100" style="s2">fish market and they completely shutting</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.710" end="01:23:57.400" style="s2">down the whole city so the kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.100" end="01:23:59.680" style="s2">difference in approach is very I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.400" end="01:24:01.570" style="s2">it is sort of that maybe you know there</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.680" end="01:24:04.000" style="s2">now the Chinese are taking it much more</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.570" end="01:24:06.790" style="s2">seriously than the rest of the world yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:10.120" style="s2">I agree with this New Zealand seems to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.790" end="01:24:12.220" style="s2">have cured its problem providing a model</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.120" end="01:24:14.380" style="s2">for what we should have done but the</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.220" end="01:24:16.990" style="s2">whole thing is just so incoherent that</p>

<p begin="01:24:16.990" end="01:24:23.260" style="s2">before the thing is stamped out or under</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.140" end="01:24:25.440" style="s2">control or you have a vaccine the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.260" end="01:24:29.410" style="s2">obvious thing that you need is</p>

<p begin="01:24:29.410" end="01:24:33.250" style="s2">that we can just simply take those who</p>

<p begin="01:24:33.250" end="01:24:38.530" style="s2">and eliminate them from a position to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.160" end="01:24:42.220" style="s2">it and we just we aren&#39;t there we have</p>

<p begin="01:24:42.220" end="01:24:49.450" style="s2">available and so anyway I find the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.390" end="01:24:53.050" style="s2">entire response so incoherent is to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.450" end="01:24:54.460" style="s2">just absolutely maddening and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:25:12.940" end="01:25:22.070" style="s2">yes okay what can we do to create safe</p>

<p begin="01:27:11.000" end="01:27:15.040" style="s2">there are dozens hundreds of different</p>

<p begin="01:27:15.040" end="01:27:20.860" style="s2">that are essentially same as can Furion</p>

<p begin="01:27:20.860" end="01:27:27.340" style="s2">protein sequences digestion enzymes are</p>

<p begin="01:27:29.530" end="01:27:35.230" style="s2">all sorts of genetic recombination or</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.680" end="01:27:38.200" style="s2">whatever sorts of purposes that bacteria</p>

<p begin="01:27:41.400" end="01:27:48.520" style="s2">genetic manipulation tools we we now</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.920" end="01:27:51.490" style="s2">kind of were able to use the them</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.520" end="01:27:54.610" style="s2">further for our purposes which is you</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.490" end="01:27:56.410" style="s2">can slice in a given spot of the</p>

<p begin="01:27:56.410" end="01:28:01.060" style="s2">enzyme so there&#39;s a particular enzyme</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.570" end="01:28:03.850" style="s2">recognition sequence and you put that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.060" end="01:28:06.970" style="s2">enzyme and culture and it will cut at</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.850" end="01:28:10.900" style="s2">that particular spot whatever you use it</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.970" end="01:28:13.540" style="s2">be given and so this view inside has one</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.900" end="01:28:18.670" style="s2">particular recognition sequence that can</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.540" end="01:28:22.690" style="s2">be recognized by what is called the 401</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.670" end="01:28:23.890" style="s2">restriction enzyme and so if you do you</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.690" end="01:28:26.380" style="s2">can use it as a screening tool in</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.890" end="01:28:29.830" style="s2">culture for what is called because our</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.380" end="01:28:32.320" style="s2">flip method of screening is the</p>

<p begin="01:28:32.320" end="01:28:37.960" style="s2">so basically the different lengths of</p>

<p begin="01:28:37.960" end="01:28:44.080" style="s2">you run a gel for your experiment</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.080" end="01:28:50.380" style="s2">that that enzyme site you&#39;d have a one</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.380" end="01:28:53.050" style="s2">long kind of strategy but if you have it</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.380" end="01:28:55.990" style="s2">in your culture it will be cut so you</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.050" end="01:28:58.780" style="s2">have two short fragments so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.990" end="01:29:01.450" style="s2">the different length then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.780" end="01:29:03.910" style="s2">polar motions that is used to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.450" end="01:29:07.830" style="s2">screen for presence or absence of this</p>

<p begin="01:29:34.090" end="01:29:43.540" style="s2">where it found a particular sequence of</p>

<p begin="01:30:41.950" end="01:30:46.090" style="s2">for you run these things out to get them</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.080" end="01:30:47.290" style="s2">to separate and then you can see whether</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.090" end="01:30:49.480" style="s2">or not you have a fragment of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.290" end="01:30:51.190" style="s2">correct length right now there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.480" end="01:30:52.570" style="s2">of technical detail in how it is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.190" end="01:30:53.860" style="s2">you calibrate these things so you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.570" end="01:30:56.500" style="s2">what length you&#39;re actually looking at</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.860" end="01:30:59.290" style="s2">but nonetheless it can be done and what</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.500" end="01:31:05.590" style="s2">that means then is if you introduce this</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.290" end="01:31:07.330" style="s2">site into a viral genome in order to you</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.590" end="01:31:08.980" style="s2">know if you&#39;re introducing the fern site</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.330" end="01:31:10.750" style="s2">for your own purposes you want the fern</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.980" end="01:31:13.840" style="s2">site there to enhance transmissibility</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.750" end="01:31:17.250" style="s2">then you&#39;ve created by adding this</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.840" end="01:31:19.720" style="s2">flanking sequence you&#39;ve created a a</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.250" end="01:31:22.150" style="s2">target fragment that you can then search</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.720" end="01:31:26.020" style="s2">for and detect whether it is present or</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.150" end="01:31:28.200" style="s2">not is that about right Yuri yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.020" end="01:31:31.210" style="s2">absolutely and then you can screen for</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.200" end="01:31:34.950" style="s2">colonies for either the presence of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.210" end="01:31:37.480" style="s2">fragment or the absence of this tracker</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.950" end="01:31:39.130" style="s2">yeah so you can screen anything for a</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.480" end="01:31:40.720" style="s2">fragment that&#39;s this length and then if</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.130" end="01:31:42.369" style="s2">you want to do further scrutinizing you</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.720" end="01:31:44.860" style="s2">can actually take what</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.369" end="01:31:46.209" style="s2">was run to that place on the gel and you</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.860" end="01:31:47.979" style="s2">could investigate further what&#39;s in it</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.209" end="01:31:50.099" style="s2">but the quick and dirty test is just is</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.979" end="01:31:58.840" style="s2">there a fragment of the right length</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.099" end="01:32:01.239" style="s2">right and the use of these fragments in</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.840" end="01:32:03.249" style="s2">biology was much more prevalent before</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.239" end="01:32:07.929" style="s2">you know the whole genome sequencing or</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.249" end="01:32:10.239" style="s2">NGS was much more cheap and you know a</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.929" end="01:32:11.619" style="s2">little boy as it is right now whereas</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.239" end="01:32:14.019" style="s2">before you know sequencing could take</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.619" end="01:32:15.159" style="s2">much longer you wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.019" end="01:32:17.229" style="s2">sequence frequently because it was</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.159" end="01:32:21.219" style="s2">expensive but using these kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.229" end="01:32:23.439" style="s2">methods like our flip was just quick and</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.219" end="01:32:27.999" style="s2">dirty way of screening colonies and</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.439" end="01:32:29.019" style="s2">today it&#39;s not as prevalent using this</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.999" end="01:32:31.840" style="s2">method because you can pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.019" end="01:32:35.409" style="s2">sequence any calling you have but it</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.840" end="01:32:37.929" style="s2">could still be you in use a very robust</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.409" end="01:32:41.349" style="s2">method for if you have a very large</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.929" end="01:32:43.689" style="s2">library quick access to it to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.349" end="01:32:46.229" style="s2">tell if you got the wrong right calling</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.689" end="01:32:48.550" style="s2">you or the wrong quality it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.229" end="01:32:50.590" style="s2">having that sequence in is definitely</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.550" end="01:32:53.619" style="s2">helpful and it&#39;s just odd because the</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.590" end="01:32:56.199" style="s2">codons coding for this art for the our</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.619" end="01:32:58.570" style="s2">genes and creating this fear inside this</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.199" end="01:33:03.239" style="s2">digestion enzymes site they&#39;re very rare</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.570" end="01:33:05.739" style="s2">codons that they&#39;re not usually used in</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.239" end="01:33:08.050" style="s2">coronaviruses of the power this lineage</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.739" end="01:33:10.449" style="s2">of coronaviruses usually are Genizah</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.050" end="01:33:13.929" style="s2">coded differently so it&#39;s just odd to</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.449" end="01:33:18.219" style="s2">see and it&#39;s like to exact same codons</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.929" end="01:33:23.110" style="s2">very rare kodos in in sequence so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.219" end="01:33:27.669" style="s2">just odd coincidence yeah it was human</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.110" end="01:33:31.239" style="s2">made make all the total sense so if i</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.669" end="01:33:33.610" style="s2">can sum this up there are lots of little</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.239" end="01:33:36.340" style="s2">techniques that people who are skilled</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.610" end="01:33:38.590" style="s2">in the laboratory arts use to make their</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.340" end="01:33:41.289" style="s2">own work simpler right just the same way</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.590" end="01:33:43.110" style="s2">a programmer would put out in a little</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.289" end="01:33:45.729" style="s2">piece of code that would allow them to</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.110" end="01:33:47.679" style="s2">check whether some subroutine was doing</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.729" end="01:33:49.570" style="s2">what it was supposed to or something</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.679" end="01:33:52.329" style="s2">like that there are lots of little</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.570" end="01:33:55.449" style="s2">tricks you can put a little you can add</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.329" end="01:33:56.030" style="s2">something that will cause a particle to</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.449" end="01:33:57.829" style="s2">flourish</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.030" end="01:33:59.539" style="s2">if it&#39;s present and so then you can just</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.829" end="01:34:01.489" style="s2">you know shine a particular light at a</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.539" end="01:34:03.079" style="s2">colony and see whether the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.489" end="01:34:04.760" style="s2">there that sort of thing these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.079" end="01:34:06.679" style="s2">are everywhere these little techniques</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.760" end="01:34:10.730" style="s2">that just facilitate laboratory work and</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.679" end="01:34:13.190" style="s2">so what URI is saying is that to code</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.730" end="01:34:15.679" style="s2">for arginine is common but the way</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.190" end="01:34:17.300" style="s2">arginine is coded the particular codon</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.679" end="01:34:19.760" style="s2">that is found in this particular</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.300" end="01:34:21.860" style="s2">sequence next to the fern site is</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.760" end="01:34:23.480" style="s2">conspicuous in that it is absent from</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.860" end="01:34:25.820" style="s2">most coronaviruses so for whatever</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.480" end="01:34:29.900" style="s2">reason coronaviruses don&#39;t produce it</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.820" end="01:34:31.520" style="s2">normally or not very regularly and right</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.900" end="01:34:34.969" style="s2">at a site that we&#39;re talking about how</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.520" end="01:34:39.079" style="s2">did this a why is there for insight</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.969" end="01:34:42.530" style="s2">that&#39;s uncommon and conspicuous B why is</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.079" end="01:34:45.619" style="s2">it an insert rather than a series of</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.530" end="01:34:50.059" style="s2">mutations and then see why does it have</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.619" end="01:34:53.270" style="s2">this conspicuous sequence next to it</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.059" end="01:34:57.380" style="s2">that has an own use in the lab and that</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.270" end="01:34:59.840" style="s2">is coded for in a way that does not</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.380" end="01:35:01.550" style="s2">suggest a normal natural process in</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.840" end="01:35:03.110" style="s2">these viruses because in general we</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.550" end="01:35:05.869" style="s2">don&#39;t see it that&#39;s three pieces of</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.110" end="01:35:09.289" style="s2">evidence related to the fern site that</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.869" end="01:35:11.360" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s not the smoking gun but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.289" end="01:35:13.099" style="s2">certainly conspicuous that somebody</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.360" end="01:35:15.829" style="s2">working in a lab facilitating their own</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.099" end="01:35:19.639" style="s2">work might have added this sequence in</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.829" end="01:35:25.429" style="s2">order to be able to cut at that exact</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.639" end="01:35:28.659" style="s2">location and done it in a way that fit</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.429" end="01:35:33.739" style="s2">their laboratory modality rather than</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.659" end="01:35:38.000" style="s2">some sort of natural process yep perfect</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.739" end="01:35:40.820" style="s2">all right let&#39;s see what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.000" end="01:35:43.250" style="s2">about the full full of misinformation</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.820" end="01:35:47.530" style="s2">World Health Organization link under</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.250" end="01:35:50.239" style="s2">every video even mentioning the virus I</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.530" end="01:35:51.829" style="s2">get the problem you got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.239" end="01:35:55.159" style="s2">misinformation you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.829" end="01:35:59.539" style="s2">people spreading low quality conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.159" end="01:36:02.809" style="s2">hypotheses on the other hand Google</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.539" end="01:36:05.539" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what a counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.809" end="01:36:07.340" style="s2">hypothesis that is important sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.539" end="01:36:09.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have an algorithm to figure</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.340" end="01:36:11.810" style="s2">it out it doesn&#39;t have a team of</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.920" end="01:36:13.489" style="s2">who are capable of sweating it out and</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.810" end="01:36:15.590" style="s2">even if it did that team of biologists</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.489" end="01:36:19.280" style="s2">is gonna suffer from the same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.590" end="01:36:21.050" style="s2">perverse incentives that are virality</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.280" end="01:36:23.570" style="s2">community is suffering from so in some</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.050" end="01:36:27.890" style="s2">sense I think the only rational thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.570" end="01:36:29.420" style="s2">you want to do is leave it so that yes</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.890" end="01:36:31.640" style="s2">cruddy information can be presented</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.420" end="01:36:34.280" style="s2">people are in a position to evaluate it</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.640" end="01:36:37.340" style="s2">themselves but that means that the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.280" end="01:36:40.730" style="s2">that people want to shut down but that</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.340" end="01:36:42.739" style="s2">are correct are also allowed to to get</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.730" end="01:36:44.900" style="s2">into the world I just don&#39;t see an</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.739" end="01:36:46.820" style="s2">alternative system at this point so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.900" end="01:36:49.280" style="s2">very much against these warnings because</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.820" end="01:36:52.489" style="s2">I think they basically are a wink that</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.280" end="01:36:54.770" style="s2">says this is not a sanctioned idea and</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.489" end="01:36:56.210" style="s2">this is not a sanctioned idea yes we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.770" end="01:36:58.580" style="s2">eliminate a lot of garbage but it will</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.210" end="01:37:01.160" style="s2">also eliminate the stuff that the system</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.580" end="01:37:06.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to hear the true stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.160" end="01:37:13.429" style="s2">the system doesn&#39;t want to hear anything</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.800" end="01:37:17.780" style="s2">that you want to prevent misinformation</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.429" end="01:37:19.460" style="s2">and I guess having this kind of generic</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.780" end="01:37:25.400" style="s2">warning is much better weighted</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.460" end="01:37:28.210" style="s2">censorship I guess there&#39;s no really</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.400" end="01:37:32.110" style="s2">like a win-win situation in this</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.210" end="01:37:34.580" style="s2">emerging pandemic a lot of unknown</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.110" end="01:37:36.940" style="s2">emerging knowledge that we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.580" end="01:37:38.840" style="s2">know they could the truth value of so</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.940" end="01:37:41.199" style="s2">eventually everything will be sorted out</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.840" end="01:37:45.260" style="s2">and we shouldn&#39;t definitely shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.199" end="01:37:50.900" style="s2">censor or let stop anyone from prevent</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.260" end="01:37:53.150" style="s2">anybody from speaking having some sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.900" end="01:38:05.300" style="s2">of warning you know all these ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.150" end="01:38:08.090" style="s2">still in stages yep okay next one given</p>

<p begin="01:38:17.330" end="01:38:22.869" style="s2">virality which works on bat borne</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.300" end="01:38:24.969" style="s2">viruses amongst them amongst others</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.869" end="01:38:26.980" style="s2">I must say I don&#39;t totally understand</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.969" end="01:38:28.830" style="s2">the question there parts of it I get to</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.980" end="01:38:35.409" style="s2">you do you understand the question I</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.830" end="01:38:37.690" style="s2">think I I&#39;m a so there&#39;s I think of</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.409" end="01:38:41.380" style="s2">two-part questions really two-part</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.690" end="01:38:44.260" style="s2">question because I mean there is this</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.380" end="01:38:47.469" style="s2">recent print by - I can others from ABS</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.260" end="01:38:51.099" style="s2">already in his published paper that did</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.469" end="01:38:53.440" style="s2">posit that it&#39;s probably the start</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.099" end="01:38:55.570" style="s2">students probably came from Malaysia</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.440" end="01:38:58.150" style="s2">because pangolins are only found in</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.570" end="01:38:59.679" style="s2">Malaysia and but again it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.150" end="01:39:03.190" style="s2">conjecture I mean they don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.679" end="01:39:06.099" style="s2">any any solid evidence to back up that</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.190" end="01:39:07.810" style="s2">claim and the the second part of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.099" end="01:39:11.080" style="s2">question is the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.810" end="01:39:13.929" style="s2">guqin CDC there was like 300 meters from</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.080" end="01:39:16.000" style="s2">the Hunan cmart seafood market and the</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.929" end="01:39:16.949" style="s2">Mohan Institute of biology because there</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.000" end="01:39:21.520" style="s2">was this</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.949" end="01:39:24.820" style="s2">original idea by the Chinese scientists</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.520" end="01:39:27.460" style="s2">I think Michelle buteau who published a</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.820" end="01:39:29.619" style="s2">preprint and and thought that maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.460" end="01:39:32.020" style="s2">was someone working from someone working</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.619" end="01:39:34.540" style="s2">in the woman CDC close to the seafood</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.020" end="01:39:37.179" style="s2">market it has an advert in advertently</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.540" end="01:39:37.810" style="s2">released the kind of sample of bat</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.179" end="01:39:41.139" style="s2">coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.810" end="01:39:43.270" style="s2">or maybe arthropod coronavirus bat</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.139" end="01:39:47.889" style="s2">related kind of virus found in north</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.270" end="01:39:52.750" style="s2">report because this was young one cow or</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.889" end="01:39:58.000" style="s2">something and he&#39;s he&#39;s a big guy he he</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.750" end="01:40:01.389" style="s2">is investigating bat worn ticks and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.000" end="01:40:03.070" style="s2">he had been featured prominently in some</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.389" end="01:40:06.190" style="s2">Chinese publications where he was</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.070" end="01:40:08.590" style="s2">showing collecting bats finding ticks on</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.190" end="01:40:11.860" style="s2">them bringing bringing those live bats</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.590" end="01:40:13.929" style="s2">and ticks back into the Wuhan CDC to</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.860" end="01:40:16.570" style="s2">collect to extract the samples to</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.929" end="01:40:18.369" style="s2">extract the core virus and I think he</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.570" end="01:40:20.980" style="s2">boasted that he had been quarantined</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.369" end="01:40:22.090" style="s2">sometimes because he was exposed bath</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.980" end="01:40:26.020" style="s2">bladder but</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.090" end="01:40:28.900" style="s2">urine and so this was the original idea</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.020" end="01:40:31.420" style="s2">of this change dr. shalba tell that</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.900" end="01:40:34.090" style="s2">maybe he is the guy who caused the</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.420" end="01:40:35.739" style="s2">outbreak but they don&#39;t show up at our</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.090" end="01:40:38.980" style="s2">cool that preprint and can</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.739" end="01:40:41.020" style="s2">this light of an investigation of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.980" end="01:40:43.090" style="s2">ones DC being the possible origin of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.020" end="01:40:46.030" style="s2">lab leak it kind of died down and the</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.090" end="01:40:48.040" style="s2">one Institute of biology took the center</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.030" end="01:40:49.719" style="s2">stage but the coming back to the</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.040" end="01:40:51.760" style="s2">question there is a very close-knit</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.719" end="01:40:54.010" style="s2">relationship actually between the two</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.760" end="01:40:55.900" style="s2">institutions because first of all</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.010" end="01:40:57.969" style="s2">there&#39;s many scientists that seem to</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.900" end="01:41:00.180" style="s2">have double affiliation they kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.969" end="01:41:02.950" style="s2">work in in one and in the other</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.180" end="01:41:08.080" style="s2">sometimes they do work in in CGC</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.950" end="01:41:12.250" style="s2">sometimes they do work in WRV and also</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.080" end="01:41:14.620" style="s2">there was collaboration in the one CDC</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.250" end="01:41:17.440" style="s2">bringing live animals and extracting</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.620" end="01:41:21.219" style="s2">samples of various viruses which they</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.440" end="01:41:25.060" style="s2">would then turn over to the biology for</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.219" end="01:41:26.739" style="s2">further work or analysis so there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.060" end="01:41:29.350" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of investigation</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.739" end="01:41:31.360" style="s2">online of looking into this one CDC</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.350" end="01:41:33.400" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there because they were</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.360" end="01:41:35.890" style="s2">actually in the process of moving from</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.400" end="01:41:38.140" style="s2">that spot near the seafood market to</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.890" end="01:41:40.540" style="s2">somewhere more remote location and they</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.140" end="01:41:41.500" style="s2">actually had I think a public tender up</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.540" end="01:41:43.750" style="s2">on their website</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.500" end="01:41:46.719" style="s2">back in September that they had a huge</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.750" end="01:41:50.110" style="s2">pile of like toxic waste they needed to</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.719" end="01:41:52.930" style="s2">get rid of and so and there was a fire</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.110" end="01:41:55.620" style="s2">in the company that was later turned out</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.930" end="01:41:58.390" style="s2">that they won the this kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.620" end="01:42:02.700" style="s2">contracts for clearing out the toxic</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.390" end="01:42:06.250" style="s2">waste so this but like too many very</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.700" end="01:42:07.660" style="s2">interesting things going on that I must</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.250" end="01:42:10.660" style="s2">admit I have been following very closely</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.660" end="01:42:13.330" style="s2">but the Oakland CDC and it&#39;s connection</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.660" end="01:42:15.460" style="s2">to first saw all their live animals</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.330" end="01:42:17.820" style="s2">being kept there and second to the the</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.460" end="01:42:19.660" style="s2">Arth report vectors that she gently</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.820" end="01:42:21.219" style="s2">actually tried to distance ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.660" end="01:42:23.650" style="s2">from when she was describing her</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.219" end="01:42:26.739" style="s2">database and everybody&#39;s there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.650" end="01:42:29.980" style="s2">of like potential for questions that</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.739" end="01:42:31.900" style="s2">still we should still get answer because</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.980" end="01:42:35.590" style="s2">you know dicks are found in bats and</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.900" end="01:42:38.020" style="s2">you&#39;re still gonna take outbreak in the</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.590" end="01:42:40.660" style="s2">past few years with Lyme disease and</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.020" end="01:42:43.630" style="s2">other diseases and while tics haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.660" end="01:42:46.660" style="s2">been found to carry corona viruses they</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.630" end="01:42:48.610" style="s2">have been found to carry closely related</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.660" end="01:42:50.480" style="s2">viruses in particular by actually by</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.610" end="01:42:54.150" style="s2">this person</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.480" end="01:42:57.840" style="s2">drink one cow from from the Wuhan CDC</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.150" end="01:42:59.910" style="s2">who actually had a paper on like the</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.840" end="01:43:02.520" style="s2">whole history of or the whole host of</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.910" end="01:43:06.900" style="s2">fire is scary&#39; by by takes bad word</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.520" end="01:43:09.390" style="s2">antics and and there was I think another</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.900" end="01:43:11.820" style="s2">article in Bank Olympics this was just</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.390" end="01:43:14.130" style="s2">one area of research that I kind of gave</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.820" end="01:43:15.750" style="s2">up on way back when looking into takes</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.130" end="01:43:18.350" style="s2">another arthropod mosquitoes maybe</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.750" end="01:43:20.910" style="s2">whether they could be the source of</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.350" end="01:43:23.520" style="s2">either the natural source of the corona</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.910" end="01:43:25.620" style="s2">virus or source to the leak maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.520" end="01:43:28.770" style="s2">know the in fact it&#39;s a lab animal and</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.620" end="01:43:34.620" style="s2">carried it out of the facility but I</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.770" end="01:43:36.030" style="s2">just completely give up on that line of</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.620" end="01:43:38.900" style="s2">questioning maybe someone can pick it up</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.030" end="01:43:40.950" style="s2">and yeah I must say echo logically</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.900" end="01:43:42.600" style="s2">something like a tick is much more</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.950" end="01:43:44.700" style="s2">plausible to me than something like a</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.600" end="01:43:47.280" style="s2">Pangolin I mean even if it was a</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.700" end="01:43:49.410" style="s2">Pangolin a something like a tick that</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.280" end="01:43:51.150" style="s2">could transmit it between a bat and the</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.410" end="01:43:55.230" style="s2">Pangolin would would make more sense</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.150" end="01:43:56.940" style="s2">than some other mechanism am i right -</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.230" end="01:44:02.250" style="s2">the Wuhan CDC does not do</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.940" end="01:44:07.530" style="s2">gain-of-function research but I think</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.250" end="01:44:09.240" style="s2">their lab is bsl-2 only so but again I</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.530" end="01:44:11.940" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked into it and actually</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.240" end="01:44:13.860" style="s2">scrub the they all it mentioned from</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.940" end="01:44:15.810" style="s2">their website and once the DCC of that</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.860" end="01:44:18.690" style="s2">location and actually changed the</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.810" end="01:44:21.330" style="s2">location of the one CDC on Google Maps</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.690" end="01:44:24.900" style="s2">and my doing whatever from the one near</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.330" end="01:44:26.520" style="s2">to the seafood market to probably the</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.900" end="01:44:28.350" style="s2">new building to which they were planning</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.520" end="01:44:31.580" style="s2">to move to it&#39;s much closer to they were</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.350" end="01:44:36.120" style="s2">gonna see the world crosser</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.580" end="01:44:38.520" style="s2">yep but I mean I&#39;m sure people from the</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.120" end="01:44:40.730" style="s2">lab if they probably engaged in some</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.520" end="01:44:43.020" style="s2">sort of gain-of-function research</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.730" end="01:44:44.640" style="s2">because they were also affiliated with a</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.020" end="01:44:47.850" style="s2">180 over neurology but they wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.640" end="01:44:51.840" style="s2">it like in that location they would have</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.850" end="01:44:53.280" style="s2">done it probably be in the 108 stove I</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.840" end="01:44:54.840" style="s2">Raji but they could have of course</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.280" end="01:44:56.250" style="s2">tracked back and forth whatever</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.840" end="01:45:00.619" style="s2">contamination they could have been</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.250" end="01:45:04.209" style="s2">contaminated with between yep</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.619" end="01:45:06.019" style="s2">all right we have just a few more here</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.209" end="01:45:08.269" style="s2">another argument for gain-of-function</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.019" end="01:45:10.219" style="s2">research is being certain that we really</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.269" end="01:45:12.919" style="s2">do understand how a virus becomes</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.219" end="01:45:22.059" style="s2">infectious and which things affect its</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.919" end="01:45:25.729" style="s2">infectivity yeah that&#39;s certainly true I</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.059" end="01:45:29.360" style="s2">mean you can do it retrospectively if we</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.729" end="01:45:32.929" style="s2">found a virus for example in a new human</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.360" end="01:45:35.479" style="s2">virus related bat virus we can look at</p>

<p begin="01:45:35.479" end="01:45:40.429" style="s2">receptor binding domain caused this but</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.090" end="01:45:43.249" style="s2">then actually to do it proactively to</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.429" end="01:45:45.649" style="s2">take some bad born virus and try to make</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.249" end="01:45:47.449" style="s2">it infect for humans to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.649" end="01:45:48.709" style="s2">completely counterintuitive it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.449" end="01:45:51.379" style="s2">make any sense why would you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.709" end="01:45:54.379" style="s2">this again is already a little bit too</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.379" end="01:45:56.179" style="s2">many times there are a huge uncountable</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.379" end="01:45:58.729" style="s2">number of variations that could happen</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.179" end="01:46:02.479" style="s2">in nature manual which could make a</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.729" end="01:46:04.729" style="s2">virus you know human born but never will</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.479" end="01:46:09.469" style="s2">happen in nature in trying to recreate</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.729" end="01:46:11.030" style="s2">it in the lab yeah I agree it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.469" end="01:46:13.159" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna do this sort of research</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.030" end="01:46:16.639" style="s2">you could have a model system that</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.159" end="01:46:19.159" style="s2">actually was far from humans and you</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.639" end="01:46:20.929" style="s2">could study infectivity in the model</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.159" end="01:46:25.039" style="s2">system I mean maybe this is done I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.929" end="01:46:28.699" style="s2">know but you&#39;re right the real danger is</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.039" end="01:46:30.919" style="s2">from increasing infectivity in humans or</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.699" end="01:46:32.629" style="s2">in human tissue in order to study the</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.919" end="01:46:35.840" style="s2">process in order to prevent an infection</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.629" end="01:46:38.149" style="s2">of humans there&#39;s an obvious hazard</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.840" end="01:46:41.479" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.149" end="01:46:43.909" style="s2">get around unless you could figure out a</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.479" end="01:46:45.439" style="s2">kill switch or something so that nothing</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.909" end="01:46:50.449" style="s2">could possibly escape because it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.439" end="01:46:53.419" style="s2">viable absent some component that you</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.449" end="01:46:56.059" style="s2">controlled yeah it&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.419" end="01:46:58.039" style="s2">because they do this in pseudo viruses</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.059" end="01:46:59.179" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually been a lot of this</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.039" end="01:47:00.860" style="s2">kind of research where it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.179" end="01:47:03.199" style="s2">true gain-of-function research where you</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.860" end="01:47:05.090" style="s2">create a live virus with it human</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.199" end="01:47:07.309" style="s2">receptor binding to me you can do it in</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.090" end="01:47:08.599" style="s2">the super virus where you put the</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.309" end="01:47:10.879" style="s2">receptor binding domain and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.599" end="01:47:13.129" style="s2">completely unrelated virus which</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.879" end="01:47:14.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to be viable in its own</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.129" end="01:47:16.489" style="s2">I mean it could</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.480" end="01:47:19.760" style="s2">in fact human cells and you can then see</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.489" end="01:47:21.470" style="s2">it in a lab setting but if it escapes it</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.760" end="01:47:24.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be able to propagate in a</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.470" end="01:47:25.910" style="s2">normal setting yeah why I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.560" end="01:47:28.220" style="s2">a limited of course because it&#39;s not our</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.910" end="01:47:29.930" style="s2">true virus it&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.220" end="01:47:33.050" style="s2">pseudo virus but I think for research</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.930" end="01:47:35.900" style="s2">purposes it&#39;s good enough that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.050" end="01:47:37.430" style="s2">need to really go and to exponentially</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.900" end="01:47:39.620" style="s2">more risk and actually generate life</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.430" end="01:47:42.350" style="s2">iris there&#39;s more infectious humans that</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.620" end="01:47:44.960" style="s2">was originally in the original holes yep</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.350" end="01:47:47.060" style="s2">the problem with a kill switch is of</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.960" end="01:47:48.710" style="s2">course it can evolve away and the</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.060" end="01:47:50.420" style="s2">evolutionary pressure would be for it to</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.710" end="01:47:53.120" style="s2">evolve away so you would have to build</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.420" end="01:47:55.160" style="s2">it very carefully so that the room for</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.120" end="01:47:57.770" style="s2">it to evolve away didn&#39;t exist it has to</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.160" end="01:48:00.320" style="s2">really stop dead in its tracks at the</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.770" end="01:48:04.270" style="s2">point that you&#39;re not fueling it in</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.320" end="01:48:06.440" style="s2">order for that to work but anyway it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.270" end="01:48:08.870" style="s2">theoretical possibility and for all I</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.440" end="01:48:12.170" style="s2">know it&#39;s happening in some way that I</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.870" end="01:48:17.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m not aware of but alright</p>

<p begin="01:48:31.660" end="01:48:38.270" style="s2">yeah I have a feeling shortly after we</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.870" end="01:48:40.310" style="s2">end the stream I&#39;m going to realize what</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.270" end="01:48:42.440" style="s2">this is about or run across it and kick</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.310" end="01:48:46.550" style="s2">myself for not having a good answer but</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.440" end="01:48:48.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t all right what is your opinion</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.550" end="01:48:53.300" style="s2">on Kary Mullis the inventor of the PCR</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.710" end="01:48:54.800" style="s2">test who passed in August 2019</p>

<p begin="01:49:07.790" end="01:49:11.989" style="s2">you have thoughts well I know those</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.790" end="01:49:16.940" style="s2">people have been drawing parallels</p>

<p begin="01:49:33.170" end="01:49:39.400" style="s2">they&#39;re right today conversely just</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.310" end="01:49:43.850" style="s2">because you know their opinion might be</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.400" end="01:49:47.390" style="s2">not popular you might not be supported</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.850" end="01:49:51.260" style="s2">by because mainstream orthodoxy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.390" end="01:49:54.110" style="s2">mean they&#39;re wrong yeah hot water with</p>

<p begin="01:49:54.110" end="01:50:01.460" style="s2">mentioned today I won&#39;t it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.490" end="01:50:06.260" style="s2">at this point very dangerous territory</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.460" end="01:50:10.610" style="s2">going to yes I won&#39;t in terms of the PCR</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.260" end="01:50:12.760" style="s2">being able to not that shouldn&#39;t be used</p>

<p begin="01:50:12.760" end="01:50:17.410" style="s2">wrong absolutely wrong why not I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.800" end="01:50:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a great tool that have been</p>

<p begin="01:50:20.240" end="01:50:31.730" style="s2">there&#39;s yep</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.980" end="01:50:36.080" style="s2">I would say you know in Kary Mullis case</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.730" end="01:50:41.350" style="s2">obviously quite brilliant a little crazy</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.080" end="01:50:44.920" style="s2">and my sense is it might be that a</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.350" end="01:50:47.900" style="s2">certain a certain amount of crazy</p>

<p begin="01:51:02.000" end="01:51:09.620" style="s2">you&#39;re more likely to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.190" end="01:51:11.240" style="s2">things that have important kind of</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.620" end="01:51:15.800" style="s2">currency but aren&#39;t right like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.240" end="01:51:17.990" style="s2">that HIV is not the causal agent in AIDS</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.800" end="01:51:20.150" style="s2">and this is what I conclude it and I</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.990" end="01:51:23.360" style="s2">think I said somewhere previously the</p>

<p begin="01:51:41.570" end="01:51:46.249" style="s2">actually expect that the two things that</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.820" end="01:51:48.619" style="s2">I think set Kary Mullis off in this case</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.249" end="01:51:51.139" style="s2">one that not everybody with HIV gets</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.619" end="01:51:54.320" style="s2">AIDS and two that not everybody with</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.139" end="01:51:55.999" style="s2">AIDS has detectable HIV you would expect</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.320" end="01:51:57.710" style="s2">those things just by virtue of the fact</p>

<p begin="01:51:59.479" end="01:52:06.679" style="s2">multiple ways so what that means is we</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.650" end="01:52:09.110" style="s2">have to change our mechanism for</p>
