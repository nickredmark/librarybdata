<p begin="00:00:46.590" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">the red pill topic of this video is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:57.330" style="s2">going to be money I kind of see the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">matrix as this giant many tentacles</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.330" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">octopus which has you know it reaches</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">into and orchestrate every aspect of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">I&#39;m started with money because in</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">today&#39;s world money is the primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">driving force behind pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:16.050" style="s2">everything that we do and is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:19.320" style="s2">dominant factor in pretty much every</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.050" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">decision which is made we&#39;ve become so</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.320" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">used to using money to organize our</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">lives that we take it almost completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">for granted and tend not to question too</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:31.830" style="s2">much exactly what it is and where it</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.050" style="s2">comes from so there are three things</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.830" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">that I want to focus on in this video in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.050" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">fact going to be two videos I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:41.479" style="s2">do I&#39;m going to do a second one on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">con on today&#39;s actual monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.479" end="00:01:46.080" style="s2">but today in this one I want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">concentrate on two things firstly the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.080" end="00:01:51.690" style="s2">origins of money where do its roots lie</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:53.940" style="s2">exactly where it comes from and secondly</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.690" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">is it actually useful you know we tend</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.940" end="00:01:58.650" style="s2">to think of money as being an efficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">way of organizing society moving capital</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.650" end="00:02:02.400" style="s2">and labor and resources around the place</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">but I want to examine that question see</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.400" end="00:02:06.510" style="s2">is it actually a useful thing for us the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:08.070" style="s2">third one which is going to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.510" end="00:02:09.570" style="s2">second video otherwise this one&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.070" end="00:02:11.820" style="s2">to be too long third one is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.570" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">on the actualities of our monetary</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.820" end="00:02:16.950" style="s2">system precisely how our monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:18.630" style="s2">functions and I think once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.950" end="00:02:23.190" style="s2">watched these two videos you will agree</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.630" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">with me that money is not at all how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.190" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">think that it&#39;s very much fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:31.860" style="s2">the matrix it is it controls in in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:34.330" style="s2">sorts of ways and as I say I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.860" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">elucidate some of those so let&#39;s go</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.970" style="s2">there is a commonly held belief that</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.970" end="00:02:53.140" style="s2">bartered extensively and money somehow</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.810" end="00:02:56.680" style="s2">evolved out of that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">facilitate transactions and became a</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:06.819" style="s2">thing but actually this is not so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.500" end="00:03:08.890" style="s2">like to draw your attention at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.819" end="00:03:11.620" style="s2">point to a chap by the name of David</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.890" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">Graeber who writes extensively about</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.620" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">social anthropology and in his book</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:20.769" style="s2">depth the first 5,000 years chapter 2 of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">that is called the myth of bartering in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.769" end="00:03:24.579" style="s2">that he explains there is absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">evidence whatsoever to support the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.579" end="00:03:29.310" style="s2">supposition that early human societies</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">bartered with each other extensively and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.310" end="00:03:35.590" style="s2">that in his book The Wealth of Nations</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">Adam Smith he described this scenario</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.590" end="00:03:40.209" style="s2">where a baker and a butcher you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:41.620" style="s2">baker who&#39;s make very good butchers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.209" end="00:03:43.810" style="s2">they meet the baker want to meet with</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.620" end="00:03:45.100" style="s2">the butcher doesn&#39;t want any bread and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.810" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">so the baker has to go through</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.100" end="00:03:48.609" style="s2">potentially a very long series of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:50.019" style="s2">exchanges exchanging his bread for some</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.609" end="00:03:51.579" style="s2">eggs and then the eggs for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.019" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">until he eventually gets to something</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.579" end="00:03:55.269" style="s2">that the butcher will exchange because</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:57.639" style="s2">me and that money evolved out of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.269" end="00:03:59.470" style="s2">but he assumed this Adam Smith made this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.639" end="00:04:01.359" style="s2">assumption he said seemed like a logical</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.470" end="00:04:04.930" style="s2">supposition to him but that&#39;s all it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.359" end="00:04:10.630" style="s2">was a cepa&#39;s ition the implication of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.930" end="00:04:14.380" style="s2">this is that this quid pro quo exchange</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.630" end="00:04:15.819" style="s2">based mentality is somehow a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.380" end="00:04:17.979" style="s2">part of human nature and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.819" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">even early disorganized societies barter</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.979" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">than that barter became more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">complicated and therefore there was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">need for money what if that is not true</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.200" end="00:04:27.849" style="s2">what if humans are not naturally</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:30.190" style="s2">quid-pro-quo exchange-based but are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.849" end="00:04:31.479" style="s2">naturally collaborative beings happy to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.190" end="00:04:34.690" style="s2">just contribute to the collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.479" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">because they understand that that is for</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.690" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">the good of everyone the truth is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.110" style="s2">money that money came into being as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">way of doing two things controlling a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.110" end="00:04:43.550" style="s2">standing army or being able to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:45.979" style="s2">a standing on</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.550" end="00:04:48.830" style="s2">and being able to manipulate your</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.979" end="00:04:52.159" style="s2">populations labor to produce that which</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">you as the ruler of an empire one it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.159" end="00:04:56.599" style="s2">my contention that as is in keeping with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.389" style="s2">the matrix that we have a false</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.599" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">perception of money that is not involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.389" end="00:05:04.879" style="s2">naturally out out of out of a bartering</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:07.789" style="s2">system in order to facilitate trade but</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.879" end="00:05:11.449" style="s2">actually was invented if you like or</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.789" end="00:05:14.539" style="s2">came into being as a way of controlling</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.449" end="00:05:17.090" style="s2">one&#39;s empire and maintaining one&#39;s grip</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.539" end="00:05:19.669" style="s2">on the population so let me think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.090" end="00:05:21.050" style="s2">it soldiers produce nothing but they</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.669" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">still have to be housed they still have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.050" end="00:05:26.090" style="s2">to be fed they have to be equipped so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:28.310" style="s2">before they were paid armies soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.090" end="00:05:30.349" style="s2">were also insofar as there were soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.310" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">soldiers were also farmers there were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.349" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">tanners they were blacksmiths they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:38.719" style="s2">bakers whatever and so they had real</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:40.539" style="s2">value real use in society but having</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.719" end="00:05:43.699" style="s2">large numbers of mostly young men</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.539" end="00:05:46.370" style="s2">removed from the workforce of a society</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.699" end="00:05:48.199" style="s2">obviously places an undue burden on</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.370" end="00:05:50.180" style="s2">everybody else they have to work harder</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.199" end="00:05:52.940" style="s2">and produce more just for the society as</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.180" end="00:05:58.789" style="s2">a whole to have the same and so money</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.940" end="00:06:00.740" style="s2">was the means by which soldiers were a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.789" end="00:06:03.139" style="s2">page to compensate them for the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.740" end="00:06:04.759" style="s2">that they were risking their lives but</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.139" end="00:06:06.710" style="s2">that payment would mean nothing if they</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.759" end="00:06:09.620" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to exchange those gold</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.710" end="00:06:11.990" style="s2">coins as they were initially for goods</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.620" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">and services whores whatever when they</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.990" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">were not off when they were not busy</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.990" end="00:06:20.210" style="s2">fighting wars similarly a population is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:22.099" style="s2">relatively easily controlled if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.210" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">ruling class by use of its soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.099" end="00:06:26.779" style="s2">takes control of the things which are</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:31.060" style="s2">essential to life the arable land the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.779" end="00:06:33.500" style="s2">water the energy production and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.060" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">restricts access to these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.500" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">population can no longer feed and water</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">and heat itself because the rulers</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:43.279" style="s2">through their soldiers control access to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:45.889" style="s2">these things and so access to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.279" end="00:06:47.930" style="s2">population is granted by the exchanging</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.889" end="00:06:49.630" style="s2">of money for those essential goods and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.930" end="00:06:52.510" style="s2">services and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.630" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">in order to obtain the money the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.510" end="00:06:58.120" style="s2">population now has to submit to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:00.370" style="s2">tasks the ruling classes require of them</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.120" end="00:07:02.140" style="s2">and they may not be things which are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:04.270" style="s2">particularly useful to the society as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.140" end="00:07:06.850" style="s2">whole and are useful only to that ruling</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.270" end="00:07:09.430" style="s2">class so integral to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.850" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">money are also the concepts of property</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.430" end="00:07:15.550" style="s2">of trade and above all of empire and the</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.440" end="00:09:09.510" style="s2">lies in the same pattern that we see</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">throughout history too much greed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.510" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">too much war it was when the Athenians</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:19.290" style="s2">got involved in the Peloponnesian wars a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">war with Sparta that their monetary</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.290" end="00:09:25.260" style="s2">problems began first they lost access to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:28.350" style="s2">their gold and silver mines they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.260" end="00:09:30.150" style="s2">also paying armies that were on foot and</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.150" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">Athens so as they pay their armies to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.670" end="00:09:38.250" style="s2">buy goods and services from the local</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:39.750" style="s2">populations a deflation occurs in Athens</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.250" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">because they&#39;re sending all of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.750" end="00:09:44.670" style="s2">coinage out of the city</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:47.610" style="s2">then they started debasing their coinage</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.670" end="00:09:50.520" style="s2">to pay for the war if you take in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.610" end="00:09:53.580" style="s2">thousand coins in taxes and then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.520" end="00:09:55.980" style="s2">melt those down those gold coins and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.580" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">mix 50% copper into your gold</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.980" end="00:10:01.710" style="s2">now you can mint 2000 coins so if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.880" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">take in only a thousand coins but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.710" end="00:10:08.220" style="s2">spend 2,000 coins what is that called</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">that is deficit spending Athens began to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.220" end="00:10:13.080" style="s2">do that during this war with Sparta they</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.210" style="s2">also had these great Public Works which</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.080" end="00:10:17.640" style="s2">were very expensive and they finished</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.210" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">the temple of Athena Nike during the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.640" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">truce in the middle there was a six-year</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:24.060" style="s2">truce in the middle of this 27 year war</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:26.280" style="s2">so they didn&#39;t stop there great public</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.060" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">works and allow their market economy to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.280" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">heal from the expense of this war as</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:34.830" style="s2">they debased their coinage people would</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:38.070" style="s2">take the new debased coins at face value</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.830" end="00:10:40.350" style="s2">at first until there were a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.070" end="00:10:43.740" style="s2">of those and there&#39;s something called</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.350" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">Gresham&#39;s law where people tend to save</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.740" end="00:10:47.850" style="s2">to keep the thing that&#39;s rare and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:51.180" style="s2">spend the thing that&#39;s common into</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.850" end="00:10:52.950" style="s2">circulation first so all of the gold and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.180" end="00:10:55.290" style="s2">silver coins started to disappear from</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.950" end="00:10:56.880" style="s2">circulation and become quite rare and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.290" end="00:10:59.550" style="s2">was just these copper coins</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.880" end="00:11:01.800" style="s2">suddenly it took a whole bunch of copper</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.550" end="00:11:03.930" style="s2">coins to buy a gold or silver coin one</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.800" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">of those old gold or silver coins this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.930" end="00:11:09.120" style="s2">is the first time that gold or silver</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.850" end="00:11:11.280" style="s2">ever had a price before that everything</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.120" end="00:11:14.850" style="s2">was measured in a weight of gold and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.280" end="00:11:18.150" style="s2">silver so a large factor in Athens</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.850" end="00:11:21.240" style="s2">downfall was the expense of war the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.150" end="00:11:23.880" style="s2">expansion of empire the debasement of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.240" end="00:11:25.020" style="s2">their currency the eventual inflation</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.880" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">that was caused</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.020" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">you know they mended these coins until</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:30.450" style="s2">they became nothing but flecks of copper</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:33.060" style="s2">this was actually the world&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.450" end="00:11:35.580" style="s2">hyperinflation and what it did was it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.060" end="00:11:38.520" style="s2">financially debilitated Athens to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.580" end="00:11:41.070" style="s2">point where in 404 BC they surrendered</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.520" end="00:11:46.050" style="s2">to Sparta and eventually they became</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.070" end="00:11:48.450" style="s2">nothing but a satellite of Rome the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.050" end="00:11:50.640" style="s2">thing that amazes me is how history just</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.450" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">keeps on repeating and repeating and</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.640" end="00:11:55.230" style="s2">repeating and we never learn from all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:57.000" style="s2">our stupid mistakes we just repeat the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.230" end="00:11:59.340" style="s2">same stupid mistakes over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.000" end="00:12:01.650" style="s2">over again today we are doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.340" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">thing that the Athenians did that caused</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.650" end="00:12:07.140" style="s2">the loss of their great culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:09.210" style="s2">doing the same currency debasement we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.140" end="00:12:11.250" style="s2">doing the same deficit spending and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.210" end="00:12:14.820" style="s2">for the same reasons it&#39;s for war and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.250" end="00:12:16.620" style="s2">it&#39;s for great public works and so to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.820" end="00:12:19.280" style="s2">summarize and this is the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.620" end="00:12:22.380" style="s2">remember so nothing is as it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.280" end="00:12:24.840" style="s2">money did not come about as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.380" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">consequence of natural human activity</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.840" end="00:12:30.750" style="s2">and the desire to trade with each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:33.900" style="s2">rather it did three things number one it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.750" end="00:12:36.450" style="s2">enabled ever more sophisticated costly</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.900" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">and brutal Wars to be fought</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.450" end="00:12:41.100" style="s2">it made possible the control of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.810" end="00:12:44.040" style="s2">populations by a very very very small</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.100" end="00:12:46.890" style="s2">ruling class and thirdly and for me most</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.040" end="00:12:48.840" style="s2">importantly it warps our minds into</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.890" end="00:12:50.790" style="s2">thinking of ourselves as being in</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.840" end="00:12:53.210" style="s2">competition with each other as being</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.790" end="00:12:56.490" style="s2">commercial beings rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.210" end="00:12:58.530" style="s2">collaborative cooperative communal</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.490" end="00:13:01.699" style="s2">beings you know happy to simply give as</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.530" end="00:13:04.589" style="s2">we can for the collective good</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.699" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">so what I&#39;m going to do now is take a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.589" end="00:13:10.319" style="s2">look at whether money despite its</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:12.990" style="s2">somewhat inauspicious beginnings does</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.319" end="00:13:25.199" style="s2">actually function as a useful tool in</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.990" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">our society so on to part two if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.199" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">one of our modern BAE free-market</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:31.980" style="s2">neoliberal economists where the money is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:33.149" style="s2">useful they will tell you it most</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.980" end="00:13:35.160" style="s2">certainly is because it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.149" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">efficient way to move capital and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.160" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">resources and labor that the desire to</p>

<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:47.160" style="s2">creativity in the economy and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.660" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">competition in the market keeps prices</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:52.649" style="s2">down and increases productivity that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:56.699" style="s2">these things are of benefit to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.649" end="00:13:58.980" style="s2">but in my opinion these arguments don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.699" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">really stand up to scrutiny and in order</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.980" end="00:14:04.500" style="s2">to explain the idea I&#39;ll come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:05.850" style="s2">few scenarios the first two are same</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.500" end="00:14:09.569" style="s2">same but different as they say in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.850" end="00:14:12.899" style="s2">Thailand imagine two drugs well several</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.569" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">drug companies here new disease aids is</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.139" end="00:14:24.360" style="s2">start pouring lots and lots of resources</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.829" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">patent that drug and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.269" end="00:14:34.050" style="s2">make a fortune and all of the other drug</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:35.670" style="s2">companies are invested all that time</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.050" end="00:14:38.850" style="s2">money and paid all of their researchers</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.670" end="00:14:41.160" style="s2">that becomes pretty much wasted effort</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.850" end="00:14:42.750" style="s2">not to mention the fact that the next</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.319" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">you have two inventors and they both</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.420" end="00:15:00.750" style="s2">come up with the design for say a water</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">desalination device and both of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.750" end="00:15:03.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:05.699" style="s2">paetynn their devices and they enter the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.959" end="00:15:06.809" style="s2">market and they&#39;re now in competition</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.699" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">with each other for a share of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.809" end="00:15:13.940" style="s2">market in order to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">wind share of that market they are going</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.940" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">to try and keep costs down not to keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">costs down they may use inferior</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:23.240" style="s2">materials they may not pay their</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">workforce enough no doubt each inventor</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.240" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">sees merit in the other&#39;s design but</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">they can&#39;t incorporate anything too</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.200" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">similar to the other person&#39;s desire for</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:33.950" style="s2">fear of being sued for patent</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">infringement in both of these scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.950" end="00:15:39.950" style="s2">if instead of seeking profit what was</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:42.260" style="s2">being sought was the best possible water</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.950" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">desalination device or as speedy a cure</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.260" end="00:15:46.760" style="s2">as possible for AIDS then surely the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:48.620" style="s2">most sensible causes collaboration but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.760" end="00:15:50.810" style="s2">under a monetary system with profit is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.620" end="00:15:53.779" style="s2">the primary goal and remember these</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.810" end="00:15:55.330" style="s2">companies have a legal responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.779" end="00:15:59.149" style="s2">maximize profits for their shareholders</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.330" end="00:16:01.190" style="s2">so in a money based system where profit</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.149" end="00:16:03.290" style="s2">trumps everything collaboration on</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.190" end="00:16:05.620" style="s2">projects like this becomes almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.290" end="00:16:05.620" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.570" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">so in both of these cases by simply</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.389" end="00:16:17.399" style="s2">collaborating and sharing ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:18.990" style="s2">sharing expertise the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.399" end="00:16:21.959" style="s2">solution could be arrived at in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.990" end="00:16:25.110" style="s2">shortest possible time you wouldn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.959" end="00:16:28.860" style="s2">to produce you wouldn&#39;t need to package</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.110" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">it make it look pretty and they could be</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.860" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">built as after the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:34.769" style="s2">materials and be built to last as long</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:38.130" style="s2">be as reliable and as durable as</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.769" end="00:16:40.589" style="s2">possible again in a money based system</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.130" end="00:16:42.329" style="s2">the incentive to produce products which</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.589" end="00:16:44.009" style="s2">fail after a period of time said that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.329" end="00:16:45.380" style="s2">they need to be repaired or replaced</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.009" end="00:16:49.079" style="s2">are you giving you the chance to sell</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.380" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">spare parts or have a service network to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.079" end="00:16:52.889" style="s2">back your products up you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:55.170" style="s2">these things are now incentivized under</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.889" end="00:16:57.509" style="s2">a monetary system and making the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.170" end="00:16:58.920" style="s2">possible goods out of the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.509" end="00:17:02.339" style="s2">materials to last the longest possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.920" end="00:17:05.069" style="s2">time is disincentivized and so under a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.339" end="00:17:07.140" style="s2">monetary system becomes very hard to</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.540" end="00:18:15.659" style="s2">know right now we think that in order to</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.540" end="00:18:40.920" style="s2">know somebody came up with an idea for a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.540" end="00:18:42.360" style="s2">product that they thought would benefit</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.920" end="00:18:44.100" style="s2">large numbers of people I said listen</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.100" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">what we need people would contribute</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.529" end="00:20:19.740" style="s2">thousands hundreds of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.509" end="00:20:22.429" style="s2">so no hundred thousand hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.740" end="00:20:26.190" style="s2">millions of people on or near starvation</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.429" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">so it would seem obvious to simply send</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.190" end="00:20:29.820" style="s2">this surplus food overseas to try and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">feed the starving of the world right but</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.820" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">under a monetary system you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:34.679" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:37.289" style="s2">you start giving your products away for</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.679" end="00:20:39.059" style="s2">free this lowers the market value of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.289" end="00:20:41.549" style="s2">your products and all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.059" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">are making less money so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.549" end="00:20:44.429" style="s2">seems like madness that we can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:47.249" style="s2">give us their food away but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.429" end="00:20:50.070" style="s2">reason why because profits would suffer</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.249" end="00:20:52.049" style="s2">and so rather than give up a few dollars</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.070" end="00:20:53.940" style="s2">in profits millions and millions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.049" end="00:21:02.399" style="s2">millions of people are allowed to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.940" end="00:21:05.539" style="s2">so financial expediency outweighs human</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.030" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">within if one&#39;s motivation to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.540" end="00:22:59.870" style="s2">is purely to earn money so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:01.880" style="s2">buy the things that you need to live</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.870" end="00:23:05.150" style="s2">well this is not motivation this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.880" end="00:23:07.370" style="s2">coercion and does it spur innovation</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.150" end="00:23:10.370" style="s2">well no it does the exact opposite of</p>
