<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">introduce themselves I feel like nobody</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:20.970" style="s2">knows who I am either but that will soon</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">change as we bring more people and again</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.970" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s as I was saying before we went live</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:27.060" style="s2">the purpose of these meetings is for us</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">to come together create a tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.060" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">cooperative that we all own meaning not</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:32.430" style="s2">just the three of us not just however</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:34.290" style="s2">many people are on camera but humanity</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">own so that they can trust it and see it</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.290" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">and we can transparently work through</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:41.360" style="s2">this process of bringing something into</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.710" end="00:00:44.370" style="s2">the world and part of that is creating a</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">meeting space that works for us is both</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.370" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">enjoyable and effective and working</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">through that - what you know what what</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:52.289" style="s2">what is working about this and what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">it working in which will be easier in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.289" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2">few weeks when we&#39;ve been doing it for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">while but I will let you each introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.949" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">yourselves I can go ahead and start</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.290" style="s2">so Bentley Davis if you&#39;ve been watching</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.290" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">software developer and just looking for</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">ways to improve the world so I got some</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">ideas I was interested by jubblies idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">of a tech cooperative I&#39;d had similar</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">ideas but not quite as well formed so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">I&#39;m just here to see what we can do to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">move that idea forward so my name is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">masala but for everyone&#39;s sake just</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">better to call me Jie Jie&#39;s just what</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">ever since I arrived in Australia I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:38.820" style="s2">made everyone call me Jie I choose you</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:44.360" style="s2">safe Stein so like everyone I&#39;ve landed</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">in in the game game PE by accident and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.360" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">it just sparked something in you we all</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:56.490" style="s2">know what it is it&#39;s walking towards</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">there and we&#39;re gonna well nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.490" end="00:02:01.890" style="s2">when we&#39;re gonna get there but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">gonna get there and so my project the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.890" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">idea that I could come up with it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">of all encompassing ideas more of like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">said an extension enhancing extension of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:18.310" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:26.860" style="s2">meant to help everyone transition into</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:30.250" style="s2">game be slowly but surely my project</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.860" end="00:02:33.850" style="s2">will take a little bit longer depending</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.250" end="00:02:36.460" style="s2">on the type of support I&#39;m gonna get but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.850" end="00:02:38.860" style="s2">the good thing about it is that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.460" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really stop any other project</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.860" end="00:02:45.460" style="s2">from moving forward because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">meant to integrate everything even</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.460" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">though some might be affected it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">a lot of the stuff are out there already</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:06.280" style="s2">people have worked on the little ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:08.530" style="s2">here and there that most of the theory</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.280" end="00:03:11.950" style="s2">has already been thoughts most of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.530" end="00:03:15.160" style="s2">technology has already been built it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.950" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">just a matter of us putting putting them</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.160" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">together in a rational civil organized</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:31.180" style="s2">win-win way for all it&#39;s a bit difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">to explain especially the first time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:36.730" style="s2">being aware that this is live kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:42.070" style="s2">puts as well a little bit of added</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.730" end="00:03:44.110" style="s2">pressure but makes you feel better G and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.070" end="00:03:46.690" style="s2">it&#39;s what every other game B people</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.110" end="00:03:52.360" style="s2">who&#39;s awesome Ernesto he&#39;s doing Cuba</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.690" end="00:03:54.850" style="s2">2.0 so it&#39;s not even like all the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.360" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2">things it&#39;s not even the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.850" end="00:04:02.650" style="s2">watching now it&#39;s the people who can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:04:04.540" style="s2">watching later absolutely but just give</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.650" end="00:04:07.240" style="s2">me a few minutes I&#39;m usually like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.540" end="00:04:09.610" style="s2">in the beginning of public speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.240" end="00:04:11.110" style="s2">then I&#39;ll go out no problem like I said</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.610" end="00:04:12.820" style="s2">this is our board meeting so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.110" end="00:04:14.950" style="s2">be talking mainly about but I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.820" end="00:04:16.570" style="s2">people to know who you are and what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.950" end="00:04:17.890" style="s2">can also put a link to your project if</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.570" end="00:04:26.140" style="s2">you have one in the description when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.890" end="00:04:27.340" style="s2">well instead of calling board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.140" end="00:04:30.669" style="s2">how about gate</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.340" end="00:04:32.380" style="s2">there&#39;s gatekeepers because board</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.669" end="00:04:33.730" style="s2">meeting like less than board I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.380" end="00:04:35.290" style="s2">like board meeting either I was calling</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.730" end="00:04:37.570" style="s2">it like knights of the round table or so</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.290" end="00:04:39.669" style="s2">me know it&#39;s like it&#39;s much more like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.570" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">board meeting sounds very corporate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.669" end="00:04:44.470" style="s2">very but gatekeepers sounds like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">gatekeepers it sounds like you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.470" end="00:04:48.850" style="s2">I mean we&#39;re the ones becoming a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:52.780" style="s2">hierarchy already like it doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.850" end="00:04:55.180" style="s2">to me its protectors of the values are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.780" end="00:04:56.710" style="s2">the way I mean visioning it in my</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.180" end="00:05:01.290" style="s2">structure it&#39;s more that because</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.710" end="00:05:06.210" style="s2">gatekeepers is a term being used around</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.290" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">game be conversations and since because</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">the way I&#39;m visioning gatekeepers is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:18.700" style="s2">more in a way of they don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:21.610" style="s2">following power they&#39;re known they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.700" end="00:05:26.220" style="s2">be known there&#39;s no way to not who they</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.610" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">are but they still keep watch to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.220" end="00:05:29.800" style="s2">preserve values</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.350" style="s2">so there&#39;s decisions being made around</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.800" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">them that they don&#39;t well they just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.350" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">aware they study them try to think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:44.950" style="s2">what the repercussions are yeah although</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s a good concept I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.950" end="00:05:51.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the purpose of this meeting no it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:54.039" style="s2">is that people know what a board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.970" end="00:05:55.510" style="s2">is which is why board meeting works only</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.039" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">because people know what they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.510" end="00:06:00.340" style="s2">getting like it&#39;s us meeting to move the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:02.139" style="s2">project forward even if we&#39;re not yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.340" end="00:06:04.539" style="s2">board members or there&#39;s not yet a board</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.139" end="00:06:06.430" style="s2">or we want a later call it something</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.539" end="00:06:18.610" style="s2">better than fix the world Friday or or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.430" end="00:06:21.460" style="s2">board meeting Bentley I sent a link to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.610" end="00:06:26.289" style="s2">jewbilee just a while ago that I found</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.460" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">yesterday that there has some concepts</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.289" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">already built that we can actually use</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:37.390" style="s2">to improve this tech cooperative because</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.990" end="00:06:40.210" style="s2">if they&#39;ve made the mistakes we can just</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.390" end="00:06:41.289" style="s2">learn from them you know there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.210" end="00:06:42.460" style="s2">projects out there that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.289" end="00:06:44.680" style="s2">amazing that are already doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.460" end="00:06:47.649" style="s2">that&#39;s why we were discussing today I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.680" end="00:06:49.059" style="s2">believe you had done the document</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.649" end="00:06:50.349" style="s2">Bentley the Google Talk and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.059" end="00:06:52.059" style="s2">ask you why didn&#39;t just ask you this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.349" end="00:06:54.099" style="s2">week I don&#39;t know but asked you if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.059" end="00:06:55.449" style="s2">wanted me to like add directly to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.099" end="00:06:56.889" style="s2">or you wanted that to be kind of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.449" end="00:06:59.259" style="s2">document and then like I was doing just</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.889" end="00:07:01.449" style="s2">comments you know on the side or whether</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.259" end="00:07:03.939" style="s2">you wanted it to be a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.449" end="00:07:06.430" style="s2">document yeah I think it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.939" end="00:07:10.749" style="s2">collaborative document sometimes it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.430" end="00:07:14.439" style="s2">hard to know when something was added I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.749" end="00:07:17.860" style="s2">guess I can go through the history the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.439" end="00:07:23.499" style="s2">other option is we can start adding our</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.860" end="00:07:26.169" style="s2">comm are as adding our changes as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.499" end="00:07:28.059" style="s2">know actual tracked changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.169" end="00:07:29.649" style="s2">document camera what Google Docs calls</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.059" end="00:07:30.939" style="s2">it and then the other person could</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.649" end="00:07:33.490" style="s2">approve it but that still only works for</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.939" end="00:07:34.839" style="s2">two people so maybe maybe we&#39;ll just go</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.490" end="00:07:36.789" style="s2">ahead and yeah just go and start editing</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.839" end="00:07:38.529" style="s2">it directly and if I get curious of what</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.089" end="00:07:46.659" style="s2">having another document that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.219" end="00:07:51.909" style="s2">there during the week and then before</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:53.439" style="s2">like if we&#39;re one of us like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.909" end="00:07:54.550" style="s2">talking about that then whatever we can</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.550" end="00:07:57.879" style="s2">to or there&#39;s a reason why we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.469" end="00:08:00.789" style="s2">talking about that or we just put them</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.879" end="00:08:03.519" style="s2">in order and then you know yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.789" end="00:08:05.050" style="s2">this is just kind of a brain dump at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.519" end="00:08:06.789" style="s2">central place we could get all that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.050" end="00:08:07.990" style="s2">stuff and then yeah call out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.789" end="00:08:10.569" style="s2">what do we want to talk about each week</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.990" end="00:08:12.249" style="s2">because this is way more what I typed in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.569" end="00:08:14.919" style="s2">is way more than we could do in one week</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.249" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">yeah you just can make comments on any</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.919" end="00:08:20.289" style="s2">you post you making the document with</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">the date you make the the the new adds</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.289" end="00:08:24.969" style="s2">to the document and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">easier to track mm-hmm and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.969" end="00:08:28.659" style="s2">easier to attract like I know the game</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:29.800" style="s2">be document that was put up after I read</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.659" end="00:08:31.029" style="s2">it through I was like well how am I</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.800" end="00:08:32.680" style="s2">gonna know if there&#39;s new stuff at it</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.029" end="00:08:33.909" style="s2">like I read it it&#39;s done right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.680" end="00:08:35.500" style="s2">it might be in a published book they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.909" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">not changing things in it which is I</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.500" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">guess the difference between like a live</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:44.199" style="s2">document yeah yeah there is but in you</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:47.230" style="s2">know there are in if you using Google</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.199" end="00:08:48.550" style="s2">Docs they have a they have a history the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.230" end="00:08:51.670" style="s2">thing in there and if you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.550" end="00:08:54.189" style="s2">dates next to it that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.670" end="00:08:54.889" style="s2">really work too well because you need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.189" end="00:08:56.809" style="s2">put the com</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.889" end="00:08:57.949" style="s2">in the correct section so you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.809" end="00:09:01.999" style="s2">still scroll through the whole document</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.949" end="00:09:03.379" style="s2">to see when the changes were made so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.999" end="00:09:04.999" style="s2">think their change tracking is probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.379" end="00:09:09.410" style="s2">sufficient the best way to handle all</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.999" end="00:09:13.220" style="s2">right now hmm it&#39;s just when it gets too</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.410" end="00:09:15.589" style="s2">many people it might get complicated to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.220" end="00:09:17.869" style="s2">try Kappa yeah it will but right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.589" end="00:09:19.009" style="s2">we&#39;re like I&#39;m this is not my suit</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.869" end="00:09:20.419" style="s2">they&#39;re like how to communicate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.009" end="00:09:22.309" style="s2">why I was like I can show up for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.419" end="00:09:24.230" style="s2">meeting and have a conversation but like</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.309" end="00:09:26.209" style="s2">the in-between part of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.230" end="00:09:28.519" style="s2">communicate effectively I feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.209" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">is something we need tools for there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.519" end="00:09:31.699" style="s2">tools out there but they&#39;re all paid</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.720" end="00:09:33.049" style="s2">there are tools out there but like they</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.699" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">don&#39;t have quite the thing you need when</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.339" end="00:09:45.249" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the process is doing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.899" end="00:09:47.329" style="s2">we can do with the tools we have with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.249" end="00:09:49.069" style="s2">intellect we have right like you know</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.150" end="00:11:21.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually considered actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.240" end="00:11:24.530" style="s2">reaching out to them because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.230" end="00:11:28.220" style="s2">they&#39;re very much in line with game be</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.530" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">objectives we said there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.220" end="00:11:32.690" style="s2">technology out there that&#39;s amazing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:34.460" style="s2">just until we have something to bring</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">them on board to either yours or mine or</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.460" end="00:11:38.600" style="s2">any project there&#39;s it&#39;s like hey come</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:41.180" style="s2">give us what you created when there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.600" end="00:11:42.680" style="s2">nothing to give it to and nothing like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.180" end="00:11:44.510" style="s2">we&#39;re not offering something and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.680" end="00:11:46.220" style="s2">have something until there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.510" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">bring those people together and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.220" end="00:11:50.840" style="s2">what can we all offer each other right</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.640" style="s2">how can all of these media ops that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.840" end="00:11:55.160" style="s2">amazing and aren&#39;t owned by Twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.640" end="00:11:56.870" style="s2">Facebook and Google but all don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.160" end="00:11:58.190" style="s2">the people in them and so they go by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.870" end="00:11:59.330" style="s2">wayside like I just signed up for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.190" end="00:12:01.730" style="s2">one you sent me which is called next</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.330" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">door sounds really cool and it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.730" end="00:12:07.010" style="s2">personal I it was one of the ideas I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">for a like local Facebook right where</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.010" end="00:12:10.190" style="s2">you&#39;re just talking to your neighbors so</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:11.390" style="s2">you know if you need to know your cat if</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.190" end="00:12:13.280" style="s2">you need I mean basically what I have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.390" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">cohousing but for every neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.280" end="00:12:16.580" style="s2">so they verify not only your phone but</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.740" end="00:12:17.870" style="s2">they&#39;re actually are sending me</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.580" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">something in the mail to verify and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.870" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">I have to find nine neighbors to join up</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:24.170" style="s2">luckily my kids started at the local</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.880" style="s2">school so I think I can do that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.170" end="00:12:28.550" style="s2">like what I can do knock on doors like</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.880" end="00:12:30.020" style="s2">that&#39;s too much active somebody but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.550" end="00:12:32.750" style="s2">fact that I&#39;ve already signed up for</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.020" end="00:12:33.980" style="s2">three of these this is my skirt one it</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.750" end="00:12:36.530" style="s2">was a neighborhood Facebook that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.980" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">signed up for we have the threshold of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.530" end="00:12:38.960" style="s2">people this is the first one who tells</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:40.430" style="s2">me to find I neighbors though and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.960" end="00:12:42.650" style="s2">think that&#39;s an important piece is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.430" end="00:12:45.740" style="s2">you did they&#39;re the best ones out there</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.650" end="00:12:49.460" style="s2">but they still have a few flaws already</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.740" end="00:12:52.700" style="s2">that I saw in their concept mostly</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.460" end="00:12:54.830" style="s2">privacy privacy there they&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.700" end="00:12:56.900" style="s2">it out the door even worse than Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.830" end="00:13:00.530" style="s2">well that&#39;s you don&#39;t have to know your</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.900" end="00:13:04.040" style="s2">neighbors are part of it you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.530" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">know your neighbors names not details</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.040" end="00:13:10.550" style="s2">right I&#39;m not on it yet so I literally I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:14.570" style="s2">just you can research a few other videos</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.550" end="00:13:17.080" style="s2">like it&#39;s been on the news and I found</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.570" end="00:13:19.370" style="s2">like other like private eyes as well</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.080" end="00:13:20.180" style="s2">saying if you issue that that might</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.370" end="00:13:26.420" style="s2">arise</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.180" end="00:13:30.140" style="s2">from the way it&#39;s built and that all</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.420" end="00:13:36.589" style="s2">comes down to identity and privacy which</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.140" end="00:13:41.390" style="s2">is let me let me focus us back on on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.589" end="00:13:44.630" style="s2">topic which we don&#39;t have yet we talked</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.390" end="00:13:46.370" style="s2">briefly last week I wanted to and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.630" end="00:13:47.660" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s create an agenda is there</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.370" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">anything you would like all the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.660" end="00:13:54.500" style="s2">Bentley so yeah I threw a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:13:56.570" style="s2">out on the brainstorming doc I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.500" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">to figure out which one I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.570" end="00:14:00.980" style="s2">most important I think you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:05.420" style="s2">coming up with agenda this most</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.980" end="00:14:07.520" style="s2">important thing I guess what I would ask</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.420" end="00:14:11.180" style="s2">is if you&#39;ve kind of glanced through</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.520" end="00:14:13.940" style="s2">this I would like to hear either things</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.180" end="00:14:16.220" style="s2">that you think are top priority which I</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.940" end="00:14:17.899" style="s2">think we want to I think one of the top</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.220" end="00:14:20.120" style="s2">things is kind of like looking through</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.899" end="00:14:21.980" style="s2">the possible projects and seeing where</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.120" end="00:14:25.580" style="s2">we want to start I&#39;m still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.980" end="00:14:27.380" style="s2">leaning towards idea cafe but and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.580" end="00:14:31.490" style="s2">you know anything I wrote in here that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.380" end="00:14:33.170" style="s2">that you found concerning and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.490" end="00:14:34.790" style="s2">would be good for us to chat through</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.170" end="00:14:36.050" style="s2">that yeah no I think that&#39;s great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.790" end="00:14:37.580" style="s2">also wondering why I didn&#39;t already have</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.050" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">it up when we started you emailed it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.580" end="00:14:41.720" style="s2">me right yeah there we go brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">okay it&#39;s now up and going I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.720" end="00:14:44.330" style="s2">read it through it I had read through it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.910" style="s2">when you sent it to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.330" end="00:14:49.100" style="s2">and then so possible projects one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.910" end="00:14:50.900" style="s2">issues is just that yes I have dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.100" end="00:14:52.970" style="s2">ideas for projects I don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.900" end="00:14:54.860" style="s2">need all ideas for projects more if</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.970" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s one like I think there were</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.860" end="00:14:58.850" style="s2">three I had mentioned and if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:01.190" style="s2">add any that are like potential first</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.850" end="00:15:02.570" style="s2">projects even the three that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.190" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">mentioned honestly the labor one</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.570" end="00:15:06.440" style="s2">although unless there&#39;s more people</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.420" style="s2">involved it&#39;s really hard to start a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.440" end="00:15:10.190" style="s2">labor platform even though it comes with</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.420" end="00:15:11.959" style="s2">its own funding source but having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.190" end="00:15:13.610" style="s2">third option so we can compare them and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.959" end="00:15:15.050" style="s2">say here&#39;s why we would choose this one</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.610" end="00:15:17.180" style="s2">and not choose this one here&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.050" end="00:15:19.850" style="s2">would you know for them if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.180" end="00:15:21.260" style="s2">another one that you think is the three</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.850" end="00:15:24.140" style="s2">were the idea Cafe which is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.260" end="00:15:26.270" style="s2">communications platform the labor</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.140" end="00:15:27.800" style="s2">platform which gives us money and also a</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.270" end="00:15:29.240" style="s2">lot of people right away anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.800" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">wants to earn money anyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.240" end="00:15:36.620" style="s2">hire someone the third one was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">Yelp platform right creating which keeps</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.620" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">coming up in this in this space is all</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:41.630" style="s2">of these cool projects are out there how</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.520" end="00:15:44.480" style="s2">do we bring them together how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.630" end="00:15:47.000" style="s2">offer them something how do we share</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.480" end="00:15:48.890" style="s2">trust among them so every new project</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.000" end="00:15:51.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t starting from Ground Zero against</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.890" end="00:15:53.450" style="s2">the big tech giants even if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.140" end="00:15:54.529" style="s2">game B right even if I don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.450" end="00:15:55.760" style="s2">owns next door I don&#39;t know if I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.529" end="00:15:58.580" style="s2">trust them I don&#39;t know anything but</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.760" end="00:15:59.750" style="s2">creating the thing to know who owns it</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.580" end="00:16:01.820" style="s2">where does the money come from where</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.750" end="00:16:03.080" style="s2">does it go how trustworthy is it how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:04.670" style="s2">I communicate with them so we can make</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.080" end="00:16:08.810" style="s2">it better right like creating something</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.670" end="00:16:10.220" style="s2">that helps that communication tool is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.810" end="00:16:12.230" style="s2">me a very powerful place to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.220" end="00:16:14.630" style="s2">because it shows us all of the places</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.230" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">where our next project could be but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.630" end="00:16:18.709" style="s2">the idea cafe is extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:22.640" style="s2">having a place to communicate with a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.709" end="00:16:25.100" style="s2">large group of people it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.640" end="00:16:27.529" style="s2">work on YouTube but using zoom using</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.100" end="00:16:28.940" style="s2">very beta type technology to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.529" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">bring people together and say when are</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.940" end="00:16:31.970" style="s2">you available one of the questions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">asking let&#39;s have a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:36.589" style="s2">it once you bring humanity together and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:39.529" style="s2">give them real connection it solves a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.589" end="00:16:42.830" style="s2">lot of problems overnight and from that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.529" end="00:16:43.970" style="s2">space it branches out fast accessory</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.830" end="00:16:45.860" style="s2">when they have the tools to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.970" end="00:16:47.959" style="s2">collaborate and when they create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.860" end="00:16:49.550" style="s2">project has the Yelp this is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.959" end="00:16:52.640" style="s2">is like every project feeds off the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.550" end="00:16:54.680" style="s2">other ones it&#39;s like first one because I</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.640" end="00:16:58.100" style="s2">want this one so that it interacts with</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.680" end="00:16:59.779" style="s2">these ones and so right so that&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.100" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">still study the agenda so I get off</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.779" end="00:17:05.150" style="s2">track so discussing project so that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:06.620" style="s2">having less so we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.150" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">document so that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.620" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">was just there&#39;s a lot of projects which</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">are awesome I think that&#39;s great but but</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.140" style="s2">focusing it down to ones that are I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:16.280" style="s2">also just in my mind this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.140" end="00:17:17.390" style="s2">because everyone&#39;s mind works</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.280" end="00:17:19.579" style="s2">differently I&#39;ve been putting my</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.390" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">projects in like three categories like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.579" end="00:17:23.780" style="s2">one is information like history the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:26.780" style="s2">history one and the science one and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.780" end="00:17:29.450" style="s2">politics one I love a lot of which have</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.780" end="00:17:31.370" style="s2">already been done but need to be doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.450" end="00:17:33.710" style="s2">be out the other one is community ones</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.370" end="00:17:35.390" style="s2">like the idea cafe and the third one are</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.710" end="00:17:36.950" style="s2">platforms which are kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:40.460" style="s2">combination of the other two like how we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.950" end="00:17:45.010" style="s2">bring I don&#39;t know I honestly anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:47.570" style="s2">building testable person yeah I just I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.010" end="00:17:51.080" style="s2">researched</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.570" end="00:17:57.470" style="s2">few documents to try and get better</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.080" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">organizing my project then so that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.470" end="00:18:02.479" style="s2">found a really interesting document that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:06.820" style="s2">helped me organize some of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.479" end="00:18:10.549" style="s2">and how I would review their importance</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.820" end="00:18:13.820" style="s2">and so the characteristics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.549" end="00:18:17.499" style="s2">saying - for me to look for our popular</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.820" end="00:18:21.499" style="s2">a lot of people have the problem growing</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.499" end="00:18:24.950" style="s2">problems that are growing fast that more</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.499" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">people will be engaged in as time goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.950" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">on from there are urgent problems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:33.649" style="s2">are expensive those will get you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.559" end="00:18:35.929" style="s2">investors problems that are mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.649" end="00:18:38.359" style="s2">people like I have it I have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.929" end="00:18:41.419" style="s2">problem I have to solve it now and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.359" end="00:18:46.009" style="s2">problem problems that are frequent so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.419" end="00:18:48.470" style="s2">basically those would be the game be</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.009" end="00:18:51.289" style="s2">knows what uh there are lots of problems</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.470" end="00:18:53.149" style="s2">we have lots of problems and they all</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.289" end="00:18:54.619" style="s2">need to be solved simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.149" end="00:18:56.389" style="s2">have feedback loops so we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.619" end="00:19:01.999" style="s2">like deal with the we make as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.389" end="00:19:04.190" style="s2">make it yeah yeah but from the idea what</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.999" end="00:19:07.429" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is from the ideas you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.190" end="00:19:11.779" style="s2">applied these terms yeah and see what</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.429" end="00:19:13.429" style="s2">comes out on top yeah so several metrics</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.779" end="00:19:15.859" style="s2">kind of points you towards the game a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.429" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">space and we&#39;re developed in game a so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.859" end="00:19:19.820" style="s2">we have to be careful I would so some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:24.440" style="s2">those I would take off and I would add a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.820" end="00:19:27.710" style="s2">couple this is just a reference it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.440" end="00:19:29.599" style="s2">just a guy here&#39;s Ernesto&#39;s option for</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.710" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">the first one which I love but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.599" end="00:19:32.539" style="s2">know if it helps with our game be space</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:35.359" style="s2">but immigrant human empowerment platform</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.539" end="00:19:37.489" style="s2">and I think that any like any platform</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.359" end="00:19:39.590" style="s2">that brings people together to be able</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.489" end="00:19:40.909" style="s2">to form their own groups even if like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.590" end="00:19:42.769" style="s2">and that our group is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.909" end="00:19:44.119" style="s2">groups is also powerful but again you</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:20.630" style="s2">but also creating this in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.070" end="00:20:22.250" style="s2">like if we don&#39;t have money we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.630" end="00:20:24.590" style="s2">hire people so we kind of have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.250" end="00:20:26.150" style="s2">with who comes on board right like which</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.590" end="00:20:27.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t not to do that because it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.510" end="00:20:32.630" style="s2">ask where&#39;s the graphic designer someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:39.740" style="s2">watching might know when they might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.630" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">one but we can only be so yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.740" end="00:20:44.090" style="s2">and so finding this seems to work in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:46.820" style="s2">this space the right people come around</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.090" end="00:20:48.650" style="s2">at the right time which is awesome the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.820" end="00:20:50.540" style="s2">only issue I had with the whole document</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.650" end="00:20:52.130" style="s2">Bentley was and it&#39;s not really an issue</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.540" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">why do I use that language but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.130" end="00:20:54.830" style="s2">community rules which I under totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:56.510" style="s2">understand you just took from the game</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.830" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">be space the Facebook group yeah as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.510" end="00:20:59.990" style="s2">starter place even when they did it I</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:01.850" style="s2">was like wait how did you guys have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.990" end="00:21:03.290" style="s2">three-person conversation and then put</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:04.790" style="s2">it up and decide that I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.290" end="00:21:06.650" style="s2">problem with a single one of these</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.790" end="00:21:11.510" style="s2">community rules except that they exist</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.650" end="00:21:15.080" style="s2">meaning that like any set of rules any</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.510" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">set of guidelines starts with it like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.080" end="00:21:18.920" style="s2">explain us like it starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:20.540" style="s2">premise that these things are already</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.920" end="00:21:21.890" style="s2">gonna go wrong and it also starts the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.540" end="00:21:23.480" style="s2">premise like if you can&#39;t do this you</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.890" end="00:21:24.950" style="s2">can&#39;t be part of this group which I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.480" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">understand the importance of it at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.950" end="00:21:29.480" style="s2">same time as somebody who&#39;s had brain</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.950" style="s2">damage so that I don&#39;t have as much will</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.480" end="00:21:32.750" style="s2">powers I used to have I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.950" end="00:21:35.150" style="s2">enough certain things that other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.750" end="00:21:37.730" style="s2">do I get how everyone can&#39;t be this like</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.150" end="00:21:41.240" style="s2">everyone doesn&#39;t have the same access to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.730" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">emotional intelligence or locus or those</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.240" end="00:21:45.230" style="s2">kind of things and so although I have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:49.670" style="s2">problem with any of those to me like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.230" end="00:21:51.920" style="s2">simple rules like be kind and try you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.670" end="00:21:54.140" style="s2">don&#39;t be like try to show up and do</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.920" end="00:21:56.330" style="s2">those things are simpler like even the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.140" end="00:21:58.820" style="s2">Omega rule which I like is like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.330" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">wait but like it&#39;s too complicated for</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.820" end="00:22:02.450" style="s2">people that kind of understand and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:03.980" style="s2">not that I don&#39;t think there should be</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:06.580" style="s2">guidelines I think there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.980" end="00:22:08.929" style="s2">more of us before there&#39;s guidelines and</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.580" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">right now when there&#39;s really just two</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:12.800" style="s2">of us Bentley and I and then like Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:13.520" style="s2">joining us today it would be like how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.800" end="00:22:17.180" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.520" end="00:22:20.150" style="s2">like what are our guidelines to interact</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.180" end="00:22:21.770" style="s2">with each other right and then when a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.150" end="00:22:23.000" style="s2">third person comes on board what do they</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.770" end="00:22:24.890" style="s2">need as opposed to making these</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.000" end="00:22:26.420" style="s2">overarching how do we like those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.890" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">important things to discuss if that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.420" end="00:22:31.070" style="s2">makes sense but not necessarily have as</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:34.040" style="s2">like law when I want as little law as</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.070" end="00:22:37.850" style="s2">possible have it be more simple be kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.040" end="00:22:39.650" style="s2">and when you mess up on mess-up make an</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.850" end="00:22:41.930" style="s2">apology make it amends figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.650" end="00:22:43.370" style="s2">even that is hard for a lot of people so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.930" end="00:22:45.380" style="s2">how does somebody do that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.370" end="00:22:46.940" style="s2">have the skill right can we walk someone</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.380" end="00:22:49.550" style="s2">through an apology like this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.940" end="00:22:52.010" style="s2">literally how you do an apology and them</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.550" end="00:22:53.930" style="s2">yeah yeah well be be kinds a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.010" end="00:23:02.120" style="s2">advanced than I mean apology is a bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.930" end="00:23:04.400" style="s2">more advanced than because right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.120" end="00:23:08.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen someone some of the comments</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:11.750" style="s2">on the Facebook about simple rules and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.390" end="00:23:13.490" style="s2">agree with that in theory and I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.750" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">like your eye I&#39;m not opposed the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.490" end="00:23:22.610" style="s2">of saying let&#39;s not have any until more</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:24.230" style="s2">of a community comes about so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.610" end="00:23:28.310" style="s2">any I guess anything I&#39;m thinking could</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.230" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">be discussed then it&#39;s like building</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.310" end="00:23:32.900" style="s2">this organically is like if you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:34.430" style="s2">something that annoys me whether it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.900" end="00:23:35.780" style="s2">camera or not right like if it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.430" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">something that we can discuss that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.780" end="00:23:38.690" style="s2">we can figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:39.830" style="s2">does it need like I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:42.500" style="s2">conflict would be I have very little</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.830" end="00:23:43.850" style="s2">conflict in my life but um like then we</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.500" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">deal with it and we go okay well is</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.850" end="00:23:45.920" style="s2">something that&#39;s gonna happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:47.690" style="s2">future right it was in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.920" end="00:23:49.550" style="s2">misunderstanding was it like how can</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.690" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">there be like a rule in place either</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.550" end="00:23:52.730" style="s2">overarching or for us that would help</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">that not happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.730" end="00:23:56.390" style="s2">like how did dealing with stuff as it</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:23:58.220" style="s2">comes up not ignoring that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.390" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">possibly happen but not having to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.220" end="00:24:03.200" style="s2">of everything it could possibly happen</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.900" end="00:24:05.630" style="s2">and recreating a new game without</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">creating it like under game age dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.630" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">is a very different way right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:10.790" style="s2">okay well how do two people work</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:12.110" style="s2">together how do three people work</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.790" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">together how do four people work</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.110" end="00:24:14.930" style="s2">together including that this might take</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:16.550" style="s2">off right away and there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.930" end="00:24:18.800" style="s2">hundred of us right away right like</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.550" end="00:24:20.870" style="s2">owning that it&#39;s gonna be uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.800" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">owning that this is a new space to be in</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.870" end="00:24:24.170" style="s2">at least for me like I&#39;ve in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">figured out game B but now I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.170" end="00:24:27.290" style="s2">figure it out with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:28.970" style="s2">that&#39;s exciting and fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.290" end="00:24:31.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s also gonna rub up against my</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">ego right and against Lake hmm all that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.790" end="00:24:37.130" style="s2">stuff and yours too I&#39;m guessing I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:40.190" style="s2">everyone has ego and and that level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.130" end="00:24:41.690" style="s2">things and how we make everybody happy</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.190" end="00:24:43.310" style="s2">how we actually create a world that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.690" end="00:24:44.450" style="s2">works for everyone doesn&#39;t work if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.310" end="00:24:46.700" style="s2">not creating a world that works for us</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.450" end="00:24:48.620" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s creating this</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.700" end="00:24:52.250" style="s2">microcosm of an hour that works for us</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.620" end="00:24:52.700" style="s2">that is how do we have an agenda put</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.250" end="00:24:55.310" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.700" end="00:24:57.830" style="s2">how do we keep on topic how do we let it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.310" end="00:25:00.410" style="s2">go and have fun and and and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.830" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">how to communicate between sessions that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.410" end="00:25:06.260" style="s2">works right that is something that like</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">I said I can show up for an hour and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.260" end="00:25:10.910" style="s2">Friday okay that in between let me take</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:12.230" style="s2">a step back you had three sections for</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.910" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">your potential projects you said</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.230" end="00:25:19.460" style="s2">community platforms what was the third I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:23.870" style="s2">missed one of them information so like</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.460" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">yeah information information community</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.870" end="00:25:30.050" style="s2">and then like like platforms meeting</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:32.360" style="s2">services right like things that are more</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.050" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">like Airbnb and where they don&#39;t own the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.360" end="00:25:36.170" style="s2">houses but they connect you and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.790" end="00:25:37.190" style="s2">actual things that are built from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.170" end="00:25:39.620" style="s2">ground up but we don&#39;t necessarily own</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.190" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">the food but we&#39;re connecting people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.620" end="00:25:44.390" style="s2">find their food and co-op and buy it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:45.890" style="s2">together and start projects and do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.390" end="00:25:47.420" style="s2">communities like kind of the underlining</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.890" end="00:25:49.970" style="s2">tools of how to do all that and also</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.420" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">just people need people and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.970" end="00:25:53.780" style="s2">facilitate that for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.620" end="00:25:55.270" style="s2">everyone&#39;s deserving of people even if</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.780" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">they&#39;re not deserving of me as a people</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.270" end="00:25:59.900" style="s2">or you don&#39;t be like we don&#39;t mesh I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">still want to help them find people</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.900" end="00:26:07.700" style="s2">because I know that or better or better</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:10.100" style="s2">with others so yeah I think our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.700" end="00:26:15.110" style="s2">three main goals would be or several</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.100" end="00:26:18.470" style="s2">goals would be you know building tools</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.110" end="00:26:21.110" style="s2">that we could use in building together</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.470" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">tech which idea cafe would you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.110" end="00:26:26.090" style="s2">definitely be one of those both</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.700" end="00:26:28.610" style="s2">internally and use for other things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.090" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">then you talked about you know of some</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.610" end="00:26:33.650" style="s2">sort of tool that would more easily</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:36.140" style="s2">provide some sort of funding like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.650" end="00:26:37.460" style="s2">labor skills training system I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.140" end="00:26:40.580" style="s2">you&#39;re right in saying that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.460" end="00:26:41.210" style="s2">rather big project it would be difficult</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.580" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.210" end="00:26:49.159" style="s2">first one all my other ideas that I kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.200" end="00:26:53.899" style="s2">of threw in there were just small helper</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.159" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">tools none of them have a good I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.899" end="00:27:01.010" style="s2">are great for funding some of them I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:02.600" style="s2">think we could use in our decision</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.010" end="00:27:06.649" style="s2">process but we probably don&#39;t need them</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.600" end="00:27:09.260" style="s2">yet like I think it&#39;d be nice if we had</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.649" end="00:27:10.789" style="s2">a little prioritization tool Tory you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.260" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">know we could each prioritize these</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.789" end="00:27:16.970" style="s2">projects off loans</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:19.630" style="s2">I don&#39;t need then like voting kind of to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:21.890" style="s2">say this is the one I think or later but</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.630" end="00:27:24.049" style="s2">simplest and this one&#39;s the cheapest and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.890" end="00:27:26.570" style="s2">this one like raking them for ranked</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.049" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">choice voting yeah have you used travel</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.570" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">before yes Trello doesn&#39;t have a right</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:31.730" style="s2">choice voting option</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:35.029" style="s2">it just has a single prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.730" end="00:27:37.010" style="s2">level yeah it doesn&#39;t this has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.029" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">proposition you can put the tests on</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.010" end="00:27:44.659" style="s2">there for a single person yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.120" end="00:27:48.260" style="s2">people prioritization I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.659" end="00:27:50.390" style="s2">the game beat page has won the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:52.669" style="s2">or each individual person can prioritize</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.390" end="00:27:55.909" style="s2">each task in a Trello board for</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.669" end="00:27:57.649" style="s2">themselves yeah for themselves No</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.909" end="00:28:01.820" style="s2">yeah because the idea is to kind of vote</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.649" end="00:28:04.190" style="s2">on it right to say that make a group</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.820" end="00:28:09.799" style="s2">decision leave a small enough group here</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.190" end="00:28:11.059" style="s2">that no fools are necessary which is I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.799" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">mean this is what I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.059" end="00:28:14.390" style="s2">us for three years I started in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">groundswell and the people who I love</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.390" end="00:28:18.200" style="s2">for concie like pick a project and get</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">people on board I&#39;m like that&#39;s not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.200" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">not doing that because it keeps cycling</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:25.179" style="s2">but like when there&#39;s a second person</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:28.130" style="s2">and we pick a project I will stick to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.179" end="00:28:31.220" style="s2">so I think thinking through this through</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.130" end="00:28:35.179" style="s2">and talking through it I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.220" end="00:28:37.880" style="s2">go ahead and take the steps down towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.179" end="00:28:40.730" style="s2">exploring idea cafes as the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.880" end="00:28:43.250" style="s2">project and then if we kind of hit a</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.730" end="00:28:46.039" style="s2">wall you know then we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.250" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">reassess but that would probably be my</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.039" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">preference plus I have some ideas on</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:53.960" style="s2">some technology we may be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">and it it may not be very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.960" end="00:28:57.889" style="s2">implement depending</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:29:00.740" style="s2">your ideas and what you know what we may</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.889" end="00:29:05.210" style="s2">add to it well let&#39;s take a step farther</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.740" end="00:29:06.649" style="s2">than YouTube yes so um I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.210" end="00:29:08.299" style="s2">told you last week how I kind of came to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.649" end="00:29:11.570" style="s2">the idea cafe and that it was a World</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.299" end="00:29:12.889" style="s2">Cafe format yeah you said it originally</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.570" end="00:29:18.950" style="s2">came from World Cafe so I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.889" end="00:29:21.980" style="s2">how much and how much we want to does</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.950" end="00:29:23.809" style="s2">does that format in their goals all fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.980" end="00:29:28.309" style="s2">or is there anything that we need any</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.809" end="00:29:29.510" style="s2">additional changes to make make it fit</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.309" end="00:29:31.789" style="s2">our needs a little bit better from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.510" end="00:29:35.090" style="s2">world for cafe format mm-hmm I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.789" end="00:29:36.860" style="s2">World Cafe format is a real life tool</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.090" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">but they have now done online and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.860" end="00:29:41.240" style="s2">participated in one finally online</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:42.860" style="s2">they&#39;re actually changing I think they</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.240" end="00:29:45.169" style="s2">are creating a platform to do the World</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.860" end="00:29:49.580" style="s2">Cafe format but not necessarily quickly</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.169" end="00:29:51.769" style="s2">and also using zoom I think like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.580" end="00:29:54.340" style="s2">idea is zoom you can do breakout groups</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.769" end="00:29:57.740" style="s2">we can&#39;t necessarily do more of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.340" end="00:29:59.149" style="s2">second level algorithms stuff like if</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.740" end="00:30:00.289" style="s2">two people don&#39;t get along how do we not</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.149" end="00:30:02.120" style="s2">put them together because the more</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.289" end="00:30:03.950" style="s2">people do we have to separate into</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.120" end="00:30:05.480" style="s2">specific groups that&#39;s just creates way</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.950" end="00:30:09.590" style="s2">too many complications if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.480" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">physical person doing it right the only</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.590" end="00:30:13.970" style="s2">thing that doesn&#39;t work in theirs is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have to in the real</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.970" end="00:30:18.169" style="s2">world ones they have the table clause to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:20.090" style="s2">keep notes and in the online version</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.169" end="00:30:22.940" style="s2">they have a Google Doc that people just</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.090" end="00:30:25.070" style="s2">kind of put put notes in it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.940" end="00:30:27.830" style="s2">chaotic for my brain but it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.070" end="00:30:34.010" style="s2">necessarily that it doesn&#39;t work if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.830" end="00:30:35.690" style="s2">were its the idea behind the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.010" end="00:30:37.130" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m using YouTube is because</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.690" end="00:30:39.649" style="s2">I can write I could have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.130" end="00:30:42.110" style="s2">with a small amount of people and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.649" end="00:30:43.190" style="s2">would love to have a beta version where</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.110" end="00:30:45.950" style="s2">people can say when they&#39;re available</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.190" end="00:30:48.409" style="s2">and then you can match them up on it on</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.950" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">it on a question and as a group we could</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.409" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">have a question per day that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:54.529" style="s2">can answer and then the next day we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">harvesting that question if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.529" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">enough of us I tried this in game B and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">there were not enough of us to make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:02.659" style="s2">work to work with all the time zones</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.919" end="00:31:03.980" style="s2">because the idea is if we&#39;re global we</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.659" end="00:31:05.870" style="s2">have to we can&#39;t have everyone meeting</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.980" end="00:31:07.970" style="s2">at 11:00 a.m. on Friday right for G this</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.870" end="00:31:10.510" style="s2">is this is what 5:00 a.m. your time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.970" end="00:31:13.460" style="s2">almost 6 a.m.</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.510" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">which is not you know do it some other</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.460" end="00:31:19.100" style="s2">place foster I believe it&#39;s even earlier</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">than that and so having a way to have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.100" end="00:31:22.100" style="s2">effective conversation when we don&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:23.330" style="s2">have to attend to say meeting but people</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.100" end="00:31:24.950" style="s2">do feel like they&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.330" end="00:31:26.570" style="s2">because they are right this is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.950" end="00:31:28.430" style="s2">important important piece that we want</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.570" end="00:31:30.440" style="s2">to on as much as I&#39;m calling this a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.430" end="00:31:32.690" style="s2">board meeting the less we can have us be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.440" end="00:31:34.970" style="s2">the central focus and have it more be</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.690" end="00:31:36.620" style="s2">like we want everyone&#39;s ideas we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.970" end="00:31:38.240" style="s2">be able to do they use aggregate bode</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.620" end="00:31:40.430" style="s2">not so that I get to decide what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.240" end="00:31:42.020" style="s2">best thing is but like we get to decide</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.430" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">now if you and I are doing the labor</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.020" end="00:31:45.590" style="s2">it&#39;s you and me that are deciding what</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.059" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right it&#39;s not a third</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.590" end="00:31:48.980" style="s2">person telling us what project we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.059" end="00:31:50.510" style="s2">creating and then we&#39;re creating it when</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.980" end="00:31:51.500" style="s2">we have a technology I&#39;m getting off</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.510" end="00:31:52.850" style="s2">topic are do we have a technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.500" end="00:31:54.500" style="s2">company makes more sense to hire</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.850" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">employees and be like no this is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.500" end="00:31:58.070" style="s2">you&#39;re creating create it but right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:00.140" style="s2">when it&#39;s us and we&#39;re doing it for free</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.070" end="00:32:01.700" style="s2">and we&#39;re choosing to do it we want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.140" end="00:32:06.110" style="s2">do one we&#39;re passionate about right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.700" end="00:32:09.080" style="s2">like call us to us and the idea cafe is</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.110" end="00:32:10.370" style="s2">that because I think that when I first</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.080" end="00:32:12.380" style="s2">thought about it I was like okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.370" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">gonna be just for together tech and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.380" end="00:32:15.650" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have a question a day or a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.240" style="s2">question a day that brings humanity</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.650" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">forward and then once we that threshold</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.240" end="00:32:20.780" style="s2">is met and that&#39;s workable we can then</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:22.610" style="s2">start introducing a second topic maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.780" end="00:32:24.290" style="s2">people branch off into food creation and</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.610" end="00:32:25.820" style="s2">talking about how you created it we</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.290" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">don&#39;t like that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">world-changing things but then having</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:32.300" style="s2">the YouTube channel for together for</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.980" style="s2">idea cafe we haven&#39;t been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.300" end="00:32:35.300" style="s2">world-changing things mostly we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.980" end="00:32:36.890" style="s2">talking about things that are important</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.300" end="00:32:39.559" style="s2">to me because they&#39;re things I want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.890" end="00:32:41.630" style="s2">talk about about neurodiversity about</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.559" end="00:32:43.160" style="s2">autism about about donor conception is</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.630" end="00:32:45.500" style="s2">for the last the three of the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.160" end="00:32:47.300" style="s2">we were talking about and I&#39;m like how</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.500" end="00:32:49.010" style="s2">powerful for anyone to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.300" end="00:32:50.900" style="s2">that because the feedback I have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.010" end="00:32:52.309" style="s2">is that it&#39;s a fun experience to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.900" end="00:32:53.750" style="s2">to come and have kind of a shaped</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.309" end="00:32:55.190" style="s2">conversation where you should everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.750" end="00:32:57.920" style="s2">shares for five minutes then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.190" end="00:33:00.110" style="s2">bit of a conversation it connects you in</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.920" end="00:33:03.500" style="s2">a way that current social media doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.110" end="00:33:05.030" style="s2">and to be able to form groups from that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.500" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">to be able to actually say hey I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.030" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">like Bentley I&#39;d really like to work</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:09.590" style="s2">with him in the future and just like</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:11.300" style="s2">check it off right not necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.590" end="00:33:13.160" style="s2">to approach you and do that but like</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.300" end="00:33:14.600" style="s2">cool look there&#39;s enough of you who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.160" end="00:33:16.820" style="s2">all liked each other who can form groups</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.600" end="00:33:19.130" style="s2">or have it be that we did get together</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.820" end="00:33:20.600" style="s2">we had a really cool machine session and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.130" end="00:33:22.940" style="s2">like hey let&#39;s actually move forward</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.600" end="00:33:24.350" style="s2">with this thing we created or it gets up</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.940" end="00:33:26.630" style="s2">right we&#39;re the ones who create it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.350" end="00:33:29.020" style="s2">it goes through that tablecloth whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.630" end="00:33:31.580" style="s2">we version we create become something</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.020" end="00:33:33.110" style="s2">new or someone else the bigger group can</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.580" end="00:33:35.150" style="s2">take it on that we upload it right it</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.110" end="00:33:39.250" style="s2">becomes something that the larger group</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.150" end="00:33:39.250" style="s2">can harvest and create together</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.150" end="00:33:48.380" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking through that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.550" end="00:33:55.400" style="s2">guess I hear a process and a technique I</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.380" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know what what it can bring people</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.400" end="00:34:08.720" style="s2">together which is a benefit but is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:11.240" style="s2">the net result you know I or is the goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.720" end="00:34:12.530" style="s2">to move us towards a game be space or is</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.240" end="00:34:14.630" style="s2">it to move us towards the tech</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.530" end="00:34:16.220" style="s2">cooperative I mean we can do all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.630" end="00:34:18.500" style="s2">those things with that type of platform</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.220" end="00:34:21.980" style="s2">but I think it&#39;d be easier for me to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.500" end="00:34:26.150" style="s2">visualize if I knew what would hope to</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.980" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">get out of it specifically so for us I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.150" end="00:34:30.440" style="s2">think and this is the original you stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">me if I get off-topic cuz I will I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.440" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2">always know that the original vision</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.490" style="s2">like I said was so that it would help</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">together attack so it was one question a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.490" end="00:34:42.050" style="s2">day and it was how do we get the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:44.780" style="s2">involved to be part of that question</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.050" end="00:34:46.400" style="s2">right how do we ask hey what is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.780" end="00:34:48.860" style="s2">first if we already had it ready what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.400" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">our next project so then maybe we have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.860" end="00:34:51.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t know so we have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:53.420" style="s2">what would the Yelp wouldn&#39;t look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.920" end="00:34:54.890" style="s2">what would this one look like how would</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.420" end="00:34:57.080" style="s2">that impact your life right whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.890" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">question is it&#39;s an idea cafe question</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.080" end="00:35:00.440" style="s2">when we don&#39;t know the answer to one</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:04.160" style="s2">that&#39;s open-ended hopefully almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.440" end="00:35:05.990" style="s2">anyone can answer and it moves us</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.160" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">forward right because it&#39;s thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.990" end="00:35:10.010" style="s2">people or hundreds of people having a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">conversation to get people to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.010" end="00:35:14.990" style="s2">that conversation look I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:17.510" style="s2">people would be on Facebook if the point</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.990" end="00:35:19.370" style="s2">of Facebook was to run Facebook right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.510" end="00:35:21.110" style="s2">having people be part of it so they can</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.370" end="00:35:22.850" style="s2">have conversations about addiction about</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.110" end="00:35:25.160" style="s2">becoming parents about like doing things</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.850" end="00:35:26.870" style="s2">that are important to them and then some</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.160" end="00:35:30.470" style="s2">of those people are gonna choose to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.870" end="00:35:32.300" style="s2">part of the bigger conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.470" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">the tech cooperative and how we move it</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.300" end="00:35:36.609" style="s2">forward and how we improve it</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:37.809" style="s2">and then an even smaller group of those</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.609" end="00:35:39.430" style="s2">people are gonna want to harvest those</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.809" end="00:35:41.079" style="s2">conversations to be part of the next one</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.430" end="00:35:44.650" style="s2">sorry my hands are all my face I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.079" end="00:35:46.569" style="s2">colored from Halloween yesterday did I</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.650" end="00:35:55.720" style="s2">answer the question Bentley of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.569" end="00:35:57.549" style="s2">more yeah I think though we need to so</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.720" end="00:36:01.960" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m trying to decide so for if</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.549" end="00:36:04.750" style="s2">we&#39;re just doing the idea cafe as the as</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.960" end="00:36:09.160" style="s2">the main idea and not just have the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.750" end="00:36:13.210" style="s2">cafe be a source I mean at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.160" end="00:36:15.430" style="s2">we could use idea cafe to bootstrap</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.210" end="00:36:17.890" style="s2">together tech as far as you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.430" end="00:36:23.619" style="s2">building the organization we could do</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.890" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">both I guess what I&#39;m thinking is I</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.619" end="00:36:32.349" style="s2">couldn&#39;t Cafe be the first up I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:34.839" style="s2">thinking the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.349" end="00:36:37.299" style="s2">I mean it would be yes but I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.839" end="00:36:44.260" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is that together tech would</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.299" end="00:36:46.650" style="s2">also be one of the first idea cafes but</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.260" end="00:36:46.650" style="s2">I can wait</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.900" end="00:36:54.309" style="s2">yeah just that my preference would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.650" end="00:36:57.910" style="s2">that we try and start off with building</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.309" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">idea cafe to build together tech because</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.910" end="00:37:01.690" style="s2">I think if it&#39;s just an open thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:04.930" style="s2">saying hey we want people to the end</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.690" end="00:37:11.010" style="s2">result is that people talk more I feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.930" end="00:37:11.010" style="s2">like that&#39;s not going to be as effective</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.119" end="00:37:16.270" style="s2">sorry I was reading what Nestor said and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:18.670" style="s2">I missed the last 30 seconds what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.270" end="00:37:20.530" style="s2">said Bentley um I apologize I mind can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.670" end="00:37:22.260" style="s2">seem to do two things at once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.530" end="00:37:25.599" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.260" end="00:37:27.700" style="s2">yeah I was just saying that that my</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.599" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">preference would be that we would kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.700" end="00:37:33.220" style="s2">of focus using idea cafe to build</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.290" style="s2">together tack into the together tech to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.220" end="00:37:36.940" style="s2">build idea cafe yeah I think to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.290" end="00:37:38.260" style="s2">point about people wouldn&#39;t be a whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.940" end="00:37:39.910" style="s2">bunch of people wouldn&#39;t be on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.260" end="00:37:44.890" style="s2">if it was about building Facebook but</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.910" end="00:37:46.660" style="s2">Facebook wasn&#39;t a a community platform I</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.890" end="00:37:47.840" style="s2">think if it was you&#39;d have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.660" end="00:37:49.730" style="s2">people saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.840" end="00:37:50.990" style="s2">build this video platform how do we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.730" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">to build it we&#39;re gonna use video to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.990" end="00:37:54.700" style="s2">talk about it so I think in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.180" end="00:37:58.700" style="s2">a little bit easier to have them</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.700" end="00:38:01.310" style="s2">building each other I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.700" end="00:38:02.630" style="s2">great idea badly so or that I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.310" end="00:38:04.700" style="s2">actually kind of writing notes about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.630" end="00:38:05.960" style="s2">was like I need just I hate that I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.700" end="00:38:07.490" style="s2">to interrupt people when I have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.960" end="00:38:09.410" style="s2">as opposed to like being able to hold it</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.490" end="00:38:10.250" style="s2">and then wait but I&#39;ll get better at</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.410" end="00:38:12.740" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.250" end="00:38:16.120" style="s2">so for the idea of the the labor</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.740" end="00:38:19.610" style="s2">platform as well as the Yelp for apps</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.120" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">both of those would work way better if</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.610" end="00:38:25.100" style="s2">we had idea cafe up and running right</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:27.650" style="s2">because the idea of platform is is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.100" end="00:38:29.480" style="s2">labor platform is that we get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.650" end="00:38:31.640" style="s2">uber drivers together we get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.480" end="00:38:32.840" style="s2">air whatever it is and we ask like what</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.640" end="00:38:35.450" style="s2">works about it what doesn&#39;t work about</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.840" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">it right like having conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.450" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m not I&#39;ve never been an uber</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:41.120" style="s2">driver I wouldn&#39;t know how to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:44.300" style="s2">that but facilitating that so we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.120" end="00:38:45.950" style="s2">learn how we can learn what they need</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.300" end="00:38:47.300" style="s2">from anyone right and they can be part</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.950" end="00:38:49.430" style="s2">of creating that so even if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.300" end="00:38:51.080" style="s2">want to be a member of the cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.430" end="00:38:53.510" style="s2">they still want to have it an app that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.080" end="00:38:55.250" style="s2">they would use as a driver right</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.510" end="00:38:57.020" style="s2">same with for the apps like getting a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.250" end="00:38:58.700" style="s2">bunch of app developers together insane</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.020" end="00:39:00.620" style="s2">what has worked for projects what is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.700" end="00:39:02.150" style="s2">like what does it cost you that people</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.620" end="00:39:03.710" style="s2">don&#39;t trust you why did it go out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:05.870" style="s2">business right like asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.710" end="00:39:08.180" style="s2">that bring them together to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.870" end="00:39:10.100" style="s2">creating that is does that make sense so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.180" end="00:39:11.690" style="s2">like creating it so that the beta</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.100" end="00:39:13.340" style="s2">version is about like we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.690" end="00:39:15.560" style="s2">necessarily need a bunch of host</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.340" end="00:39:17.030" style="s2">cleaners to be on board to create it we</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.560" end="00:39:19.460" style="s2">can actually reach out when we have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.030" end="00:39:20.870" style="s2">tech and say hey we&#39;re house cleaners we</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.460" end="00:39:22.340" style="s2">want a bunch of you to get together so</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.870" end="00:39:24.980" style="s2">you can create some amazing for</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.340" end="00:39:26.090" style="s2">yourselves right and then invite those</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.980" end="00:39:27.980" style="s2">people on board and then they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.090" end="00:39:29.510" style="s2">theoretically and if we&#39;re sending out</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.980" end="00:39:30.470" style="s2">emails to people I mean hey this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.510" end="00:39:32.120" style="s2">new one right baby you&#39;re a house</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.470" end="00:39:33.620" style="s2">cleaner at an uber driver and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.120" end="00:39:35.420" style="s2">talking to our drivers and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.620" end="00:39:36.980" style="s2">even think we&#39;re sending it out and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.420" end="00:39:38.210" style="s2">more information you give the more we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.980" end="00:39:39.500" style="s2">gonna be able to help you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.210" end="00:39:43.150" style="s2">conversations that matter</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.500" end="00:39:45.580" style="s2">and we&#39;re also drawing in people who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:48.020" style="s2">here to create something better</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.580" end="00:39:49.580" style="s2">right like you said about Facebook where</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.020" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t a point of Facebook and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.580" end="00:39:58.420" style="s2">is the point of what we&#39;re creating so a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:40:01.310" style="s2">few things that I&#39;ve just found here so</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.420" end="00:40:06.140" style="s2">seems like WordPress already has</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.310" end="00:40:09.350" style="s2">some voting plugins and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.140" end="00:40:11.570" style="s2">basically free sites so we can easily</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.350" end="00:40:15.350" style="s2">build this for free at least with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.570" end="00:40:17.390" style="s2">blogging voting forum kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.350" end="00:40:19.940" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m not really sure exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.390" end="00:40:25.940" style="s2">they have I&#39;m sure we can create an</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.940" end="00:40:29.980" style="s2">initial platform to at least centralize</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.940" end="00:40:34.700" style="s2">information with some sections with</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.980" end="00:40:38.810" style="s2">tools to use or not sure the features</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.700" end="00:40:43.430" style="s2">that you you want to have on on the cafe</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.810" end="00:40:48.770" style="s2">initially I&#39;m pretty sure that this this</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.430" end="00:40:51.590" style="s2">specific video conference might not be</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.770" end="00:40:53.990" style="s2">present on WordPress but we can just</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.590" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">organize there and then use this as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.990" end="00:41:01.910" style="s2">side tool for now until we can integrate</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:03.230" style="s2">something I don&#39;t are you are either a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.910" end="00:41:05.210" style="s2">few familiar with WordPress I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.230" end="00:41:07.160" style="s2">somebody else making a very basic basic</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.210" end="00:41:12.020" style="s2">WordPress site for together tech and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.160" end="00:41:14.450" style="s2">even that is unlike WordPress I&#39;m a web</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.020" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">designer I&#39;ve done designed web design I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.450" end="00:41:19.580" style="s2">do computers and all that so and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:22.670" style="s2">actually I haven&#39;t really gone into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.580" end="00:41:26.660" style="s2">but it should be pretty simple I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.670" end="00:41:28.100" style="s2">a web developer for 20 years so when</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.660" end="00:41:30.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing WordPress for a couple</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.100" end="00:41:32.630" style="s2">years both front end and back end but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.950" end="00:41:34.900" style="s2">before we kind of jump onto that my</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.630" end="00:41:37.730" style="s2">preference would be that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.900" end="00:41:41.060" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s what what our needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.730" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">are because actually I mean gee I</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.060" end="00:41:46.130" style="s2">mentioned voting and stuff is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:50.360" style="s2">additional projects but I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.130" end="00:41:54.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s a need within within idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.360" end="00:41:57.620" style="s2">cafe or not yet so what I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.320" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">is either I mean maybe not maybe or</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.620" end="00:42:05.330" style="s2">maybe not today but it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.180" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">I&#39;m the only one who can&#39;t what what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.330" end="00:42:11.930" style="s2">like to do then is us step through so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:14.840" style="s2">far your idea of game be and what and</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.930" end="00:42:15.609" style="s2">maybe whatever G and I kind of think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.840" end="00:42:17.619" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.609" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">and talked through those requirements</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.619" end="00:42:23.650" style="s2">for lack of a better word so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:26.529" style="s2">kind of start flushing out that idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.650" end="00:42:28.630" style="s2">like what game B means to us no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.529" end="00:42:32.709" style="s2">sorry did I say game B I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.630" end="00:42:38.799" style="s2">completely I have the tab up so idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.709" end="00:42:43.029" style="s2">cafe I&#39;m so I was in annoyingly minut</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.799" end="00:42:45.880" style="s2">detail of what what features we need in</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.029" end="00:42:47.769" style="s2">order for you know maybe even the big</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.880" end="00:42:49.749" style="s2">idea cafe and then we can pare it back</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.769" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">down to what&#39;s our V of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.749" end="00:42:56.380" style="s2">already doing V one with YouTube right</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:57.759" style="s2">so what&#39;s a one point five right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.380" end="00:43:00.279" style="s2">just kind of start listing out those</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.759" end="00:43:01.809" style="s2">features so we can either start that now</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.279" end="00:43:04.900" style="s2">or if there&#39;s any other topics she&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.809" end="00:43:12.309" style="s2">wanna so yeah absolutely let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.900" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">that so having a scheduler like</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.309" end="00:43:17.469" style="s2">something where I can say when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:19.809" style="s2">available and it can tell me other</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.469" end="00:43:21.459" style="s2">people who are available or to back-end</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.809" end="00:43:24.579" style="s2">that like we&#39;re sorry to reverse that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.459" end="00:43:26.559" style="s2">having like I tried in game B space to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.579" end="00:43:27.910" style="s2">say okay well there&#39;s I tried it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.559" end="00:43:29.799" style="s2">would be every four hours there&#39;d be six</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.910" end="00:43:31.329" style="s2">conversations a day so people would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.799" end="00:43:32.920" style="s2">available for multiple ones in their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.329" end="00:43:37.420" style="s2">in their number time zone they were in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.920" end="00:43:39.339" style="s2">hopefully it could be two a day right</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.420" end="00:43:41.789" style="s2">one at 4:00 a.m. one at 4:00 p.m. and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.339" end="00:43:45.609" style="s2">that&#39;s either 5 6 p.m. 6 a.m. like</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.789" end="00:43:47.109" style="s2">starting beta and creating bigger right</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.609" end="00:43:49.150" style="s2">so eventually it gets to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.109" end="00:43:52.329" style="s2">the idea Cafe originally was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.150" end="00:43:53.829" style="s2">a 24 hour conversation so that you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.329" end="00:43:56.170" style="s2">come on and have a half an hour chunk</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.829" end="00:43:58.329" style="s2">conversation at any hour or half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">mark and you&#39;d participate in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.329" end="00:44:01.089" style="s2">ones because that&#39;s also part of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.650" end="00:44:02.619" style="s2">the World Cafe is is it&#39;s not you just</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.089" end="00:44:04.779" style="s2">you come on necessarily be part of one</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.619" end="00:44:06.369" style="s2">conversation but you bring that same</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.779" end="00:44:08.199" style="s2">conversation to the next one to the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.369" end="00:44:09.640" style="s2">one and so like the world&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.199" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">having a conversation around the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.640" end="00:44:12.999" style="s2">and around time zones about a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:14.759" style="s2">and then it flips over the next day and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.999" end="00:44:17.739" style="s2">some of those people go in to harvest</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.759" end="00:44:20.529" style="s2">the question which is just having a</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.739" end="00:44:22.839" style="s2">conversation exactly like the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.529" end="00:44:25.449" style="s2">that happened the day before but about</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.839" end="00:44:27.190" style="s2">what was the commonality right like just</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.449" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">what did we get out of that what was</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.190" end="00:44:30.950" style="s2">what was her</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:33.020" style="s2">like just I can&#39;t even think of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.950" end="00:44:34.880" style="s2">questions you would ask but finding the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.020" end="00:44:36.740" style="s2">thread the common thread what was alive</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.880" end="00:44:38.690" style="s2">for you what was you know like having</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.740" end="00:44:40.460" style="s2">multiple conversations the next day on</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.690" end="00:44:41.690" style="s2">that one and I don&#39;t think everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.460" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">would do that every day I&#39;d be like if</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.690" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">that one was really alive for you is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:47.450" style="s2">when you&#39;re gonna go on board the next</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:48.710" style="s2">day and if one isn&#39;t it all right no one</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.450" end="00:44:50.540" style="s2">wants to harvest it then it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.710" end="00:44:54.020" style="s2">great of a conversation that did it cool</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.540" end="00:44:56.990" style="s2">right like right so how many how many</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.020" end="00:45:02.210" style="s2">people did it normally say generally in</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.990" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">a group set forth well to have a table</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.210" end="00:45:07.880" style="s2">it&#39;s three to five people I found for</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:10.040" style="s2">the idea cafe works well a series</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.880" end="00:45:12.080" style="s2">actually magic like I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.040" end="00:45:13.640" style="s2">three because there&#39;s more time to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.080" end="00:45:16.250" style="s2">and more time to share and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.640" end="00:45:17.480" style="s2">enough it&#39;s better than two five is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.250" end="00:45:18.980" style="s2">too much if you&#39;re having a half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.480" end="00:45:20.420" style="s2">conversation you&#39;ll take five minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.980" end="00:45:22.340" style="s2">share there isn&#39;t enough time to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.420" end="00:45:25.850" style="s2">have a little bit of a conversation for</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.340" end="00:45:27.500" style="s2">is what the World Cafe talks about but</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.850" end="00:45:30.230" style="s2">no nerd to be able to switch groups on</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.500" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">the World Cafe at twelve peoples is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.230" end="00:45:33.380" style="s2">minimum to have a World Cafe so that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:34.580" style="s2">people are sitting at a table and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.380" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">move to a different table they move to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.580" end="00:45:38.810" style="s2">different table yeah with the 24/7</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.860" end="00:45:40.850" style="s2">format that&#39;s doesn&#39;t really apply it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.810" end="00:45:42.770" style="s2">just people breaking off into three or</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.850" end="00:45:44.360" style="s2">four in the game of beef space there</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.770" end="00:45:47.180" style="s2">weren&#39;t enough people to even have one</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.360" end="00:45:48.350" style="s2">group right let alone like there was not</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.180" end="00:45:49.550" style="s2">a time where we had to break out into</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.350" end="00:45:51.740" style="s2">breakout groups because I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.550" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">have six conversations a day and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.740" end="00:45:55.700" style="s2">like a few hundred people in game B</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:45:58.670" style="s2">right yeah so when I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.700" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">scheduler depending on how complex we</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.670" end="00:46:03.770" style="s2">want to make it it could be to where</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:06.740" style="s2">people go in just state sometimes that</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.770" end="00:46:10.610" style="s2">they&#39;re free and then rather than having</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.740" end="00:46:12.440" style="s2">it at like four times a day although you</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.610" end="00:46:14.390" style="s2">could definitely do it that way is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.440" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">it would just find a time that&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.390" end="00:46:20.330" style="s2">between in any time there&#39;s four people</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:23.870" style="s2">it could then group them together</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.330" end="00:46:25.610" style="s2">although I guess even if you have two or</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.870" end="00:46:27.110" style="s2">three people maybe it could post the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.610" end="00:46:30.470" style="s2">time and then other people can choose to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.110" end="00:46:33.590" style="s2">join anyways but maybe you supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.470" end="00:46:35.420" style="s2">be you know four times a day is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.590" end="00:46:38.330" style="s2">probably easier for people to grapple</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.420" end="00:46:40.520" style="s2">with or available slots and then when</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.330" end="00:46:42.900" style="s2">the slot gets four people and it three</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.520" end="00:46:45.700" style="s2">to four people and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.900" end="00:46:50.380" style="s2">then it would you know schedule at for</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.700" end="00:46:52.809" style="s2">them ya know I like I like that process</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.380" end="00:46:54.640" style="s2">like I said it kind of growing out both</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.809" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">starting with like one question a day</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.640" end="00:46:57.369" style="s2">where it isn&#39;t more than one question</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:58.960" style="s2">and then as we grow when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.369" end="00:47:00.279" style="s2">millions of us we can have dozens of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.960" end="00:47:02.859" style="s2">questions writing you can pick which one</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.279" end="00:47:04.539" style="s2">to talk about in your area of interest</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.859" end="00:47:06.849" style="s2">but when there&#39;s only a few hundred of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.539" end="00:47:09.039" style="s2">us or even only a few thousand of us we</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.849" end="00:47:12.220" style="s2">actually can we need to focus on like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.039" end="00:47:15.609" style="s2">one or two questions not will say even</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.220" end="00:47:18.730" style="s2">even a day I wonder if we could take out</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.609" end="00:47:22.900" style="s2">the time limit and just say you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.730" end="00:47:25.569" style="s2">these are the next five questions so if</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.900" end="00:47:27.279" style="s2">that if a group of four comes about then</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.569" end="00:47:29.559" style="s2">they&#39;re assigned the first question or</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.279" end="00:47:31.720" style="s2">actually the first four groups right or</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.559" end="00:47:33.339" style="s2">assign the first question three groups</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.720" end="00:47:38.260" style="s2">three groups assign the first question</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.339" end="00:47:39.880" style="s2">and then you have a a round of what were</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.260" end="00:47:41.309" style="s2">you talking about where you take a look</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.880" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">at the notes and everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.309" end="00:47:49.690" style="s2">yeah harvesting so yeah so in order</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">because you don&#39;t just want one group</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.690" end="00:47:54.039" style="s2">read having a one meeting about one</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:55.589" style="s2">question right you want to have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.039" end="00:47:58.630" style="s2">groups meeting about the same question</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.589" end="00:48:00.789" style="s2">yeah so the World Cafe works in</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.630" end="00:48:02.770" style="s2">generally two ways they have the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.789" end="00:48:04.390" style="s2">conversation again and again so they</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.770" end="00:48:05.710" style="s2">have the same question you are</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.390" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">participating and answering it at</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.710" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">different tables with different people</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:11.230" style="s2">or it can be one question and then a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:15.069" style="s2">slightly built on question and another</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.230" end="00:48:16.359" style="s2">built on question right so what is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.069" end="00:48:18.700" style="s2">one for the World Cafe which has been</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.359" end="00:48:20.380" style="s2">pretty common is like tell us about a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.700" end="00:48:21.789" style="s2">hosting experience you&#39;ve had right it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.380" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">could be like hosting your family over</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.789" end="00:48:26.440" style="s2">to your house hosting a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:27.190" style="s2">then I don&#39;t know what the second one is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.440" end="00:48:28.779" style="s2">the last one&#39;s like what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.190" end="00:48:32.020" style="s2">conversation you would like to have like</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.779" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">where would you like to post and how did</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.020" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">that hosteen affect you or what did you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.809" style="s2">need to effectively host there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.440" end="00:48:38.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all on kind of the World Cafe like</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.809" end="00:48:40.930" style="s2">how do you effectively have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.680" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">conversation and it&#39;s still different</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.930" end="00:48:45.039" style="s2">every month based on who shows up to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.630" style="s2">part of that conversation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.039" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">kind of the same thing but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.630" end="00:48:50.529" style="s2">trying to bring it into technology right</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:52.690" style="s2">which is like some of questions don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.529" end="00:48:55.150" style="s2">quite work for a World Cafe format but</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.690" end="00:48:55.600" style="s2">nor should they and we can adopt it be</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.150" end="00:48:58.210" style="s2">like right</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.600" end="00:49:00.610" style="s2">is a more technical question but we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.210" end="00:49:04.210" style="s2">to ask some and even even since we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.610" end="00:49:05.650" style="s2">more a asynchronous you know because we</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.210" end="00:49:09.460" style="s2">don&#39;t all have to be in the same space</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.650" end="00:49:11.560" style="s2">at the same time yeah so I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.460" end="00:49:13.840" style="s2">maybe a stream of questions like five</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.560" end="00:49:15.280" style="s2">questions and then you whenever you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.840" end="00:49:19.030" style="s2">a meeting you would have meeting about</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:20.620" style="s2">question one and then if you choose to</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.030" end="00:49:21.700" style="s2">have another meeting and other people</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.620" end="00:49:23.860" style="s2">are available that have already done</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.700" end="00:49:30.070" style="s2">question one then you could be put in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.860" end="00:49:32.200" style="s2">meeting to do question two might be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.070" end="00:49:34.780" style="s2">way to say disentangle it from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.200" end="00:49:38.830" style="s2">timing the other thing I like about that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.780" end="00:49:41.320" style="s2">is that um for people entering the space</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.830" end="00:49:43.570" style="s2">right for the first time to not</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.320" end="00:49:45.700" style="s2">understand what&#39;s been going on and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.570" end="00:49:47.230" style="s2">be jumped into it is a little abrupt</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.700" end="00:49:48.670" style="s2">especially through like hey all this</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.230" end="00:49:50.560" style="s2">stuff happen we need a way to con it to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.670" end="00:49:52.090" style="s2">so many of that anyway to everyone to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.560" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">able to say hey this is the entry level</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.090" end="00:49:56.110" style="s2">questions right this is like you go</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:49:59.830" style="s2">through these twelve questions when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.110" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2">have enough people and then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.830" end="00:50:02.920" style="s2">join the rest of the group right like</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">having a more of like a initiation to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.920" end="00:50:05.530" style="s2">see you&#39;re caught up to speed to be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:06.850" style="s2">this is what it&#39;s like to be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:08.620" style="s2">conversation right to know if this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.850" end="00:50:10.300" style="s2">for you to know if this type of</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.620" end="00:50:11.860" style="s2">conversation is gonna add to your life</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.300" end="00:50:13.210" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna add to it which is less</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.860" end="00:50:14.710" style="s2">important if you adds to your life</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.210" end="00:50:17.080" style="s2">you&#39;re adding to it there&#39;s kind of no</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.710" end="00:50:19.360" style="s2">in-between but if you hate this format</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.080" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">not gonna work for you or anyone you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.360" end="00:50:23.830" style="s2">participating right yeah so the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:26.100" style="s2">question could be a softball one that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.830" end="00:50:27.940" style="s2">also helps them understand the process</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.100" end="00:50:31.240" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.940" end="00:50:35.110" style="s2">like what&#39;s the plan I know to work as</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.240" end="00:50:37.930" style="s2">we as you intended don&#39;t you need some</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.110" end="00:50:40.540" style="s2">game peeing fluid game being influenced</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.930" end="00:50:42.700" style="s2">people already in those groups to kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.540" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">of guide the conversation or or else</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.700" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">they just fall into game a traps all</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.470" style="s2">over again possibly but the questions</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">are designed to not do that like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.470" end="00:50:53.740" style="s2">questions are that&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:55.090" style="s2">different than a debate format it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.410" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">is just my feeling and it&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.109" end="00:54:13.220" style="s2">less about incentivizing them to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:14.930" style="s2">something outside and more about finding</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.220" end="00:54:17.150" style="s2">the people who are good at that and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.930" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">is their like I love moderating awesome</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.450" end="00:54:24.260" style="s2">they can guide the conversation and do</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.980" end="00:54:26.150" style="s2">that and it&#39;s part of who they are that</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.260" end="00:54:28.070" style="s2">you almost can&#39;t train and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.150" end="00:54:30.170" style="s2">like the issue is getting those people</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.070" end="00:54:31.730" style="s2">at individual tables and the an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.170" end="00:54:33.140" style="s2">algorithm can do that right hey these</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.730" end="00:54:34.820" style="s2">people are really great do you mind us</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.140" end="00:54:35.990" style="s2">splitting you up like you might not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.820" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">with another one and being the person</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.990" end="00:54:41.150" style="s2">who can who can do that and and offering</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.369" style="s2">them that right being like wow you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.150" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">amazing at this and side like that is at</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.369" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">least part of the vision of together</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:47.869" style="s2">tech is helping people find what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:49.670" style="s2">good at and that you don&#39;t have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.869" end="00:54:51.020" style="s2">them when they find their passion like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.670" end="00:54:52.970" style="s2">when they find what they&#39;re here to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.020" end="00:54:55.310" style="s2">on this planet they will do it for free</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.970" end="00:54:57.770" style="s2">all day every day you just have to give</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.310" end="00:54:58.910" style="s2">them the tools to do that I&#39;m not one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.770" end="00:54:59.960" style="s2">those people who necessarily wants to</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.910" end="00:55:01.940" style="s2">host but I love being part of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.960" end="00:55:03.560" style="s2">conversation and so I&#39;ve effectively had</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.940" end="00:55:06.560" style="s2">kind of had to become a host so that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.560" end="00:55:08.510" style="s2">can host my own conversation because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.560" end="00:55:11.180" style="s2">have and that is the hardest part about</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.510" end="00:55:13.250" style="s2">idea cafe for me is getting people</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.180" end="00:55:15.590" style="s2">together in the same space right being</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.250" end="00:55:16.970" style="s2">like I can generate questions I can even</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.590" end="00:55:18.140" style="s2">pick the communities but actually like</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.970" end="00:55:21.470" style="s2">putting it out there and having people</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.140" end="00:55:24.020" style="s2">take the bait and then scheduling it and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.470" end="00:55:26.420" style="s2">then like if the tech can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.020" end="00:55:29.330" style="s2">that&#39;s where the motivation kicks in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.420" end="00:55:32.060" style="s2">motivation is more of a something to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.330" end="00:55:35.030" style="s2">bring people in because if if the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.060" end="00:55:35.480" style="s2">concept is built correctly it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.030" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">motive</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.480" end="00:55:40.609" style="s2">that keeps them in the motivation just</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.980" style="s2">brings them in and then they enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.609" end="00:55:45.040" style="s2">experience and then they&#39;re just all</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.980" end="00:55:47.300" style="s2">into the experience that&#39;s pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:49.220" style="s2">which I think it&#39;s a very important part</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.300" end="00:55:51.350" style="s2">of the entire experience right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.220" end="00:55:53.390" style="s2">why I was like what makes this what</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.350" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">makes this process fun and are like</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.390" end="00:55:57.350" style="s2">enjoyable and productive because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:58.850" style="s2">not enjoyable we&#39;re not gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.350" end="00:56:00.350" style="s2">coming back week after week and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.850" end="00:56:02.030" style="s2">not productive we can keep coming back</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.350" end="00:56:04.790" style="s2">week after week but nothing&#39;s done and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.030" end="00:56:07.369" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a similar conversation for idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.790" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">cafe right of like what made this fun</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.369" end="00:56:10.369" style="s2">what would make it better what we which</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:12.890" style="s2">is what I&#39;m trying to do off of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.369" end="00:56:14.720" style="s2">is like right what not just what made it</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.890" end="00:56:16.130" style="s2">fun for me but what made what would make</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.720" end="00:56:18.050" style="s2">it more fun and that is where I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.130" end="00:56:19.400" style="s2">three people is actually really cool for</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.050" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">sharing your story and then having a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.400" end="00:56:23.750" style="s2">conversation on YouTube in that format</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:25.070" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t necessarily work for more but</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.750" end="00:56:26.450" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to solve anything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.070" end="00:56:28.369" style="s2">trying to share a story and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.450" end="00:56:30.260" style="s2">different for different pieces of it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.369" end="00:56:31.490" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a coder</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.260" end="00:56:32.930" style="s2">because I would have coded it and it</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.490" end="00:56:34.010" style="s2">would have been wrong it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.930" end="00:56:36.619" style="s2">like this is for me to have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.010" end="00:56:38.270" style="s2">conversation and then realize it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.619" end="00:56:39.859" style="s2">what it needs to be it needs to be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.270" end="00:56:42.890" style="s2">to change in iterate which is the beauty</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.859" end="00:56:45.440" style="s2">of technology is it can so we mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.890" end="00:56:48.680" style="s2">note-taking during the meeting do you</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:50.750" style="s2">think that just something like a Google</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.680" end="00:56:52.930" style="s2">Doc or uh I can&#39;t remember there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.750" end="00:56:55.420" style="s2">couple tech that works the same way is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.930" end="00:56:57.619" style="s2">sufficient or you mentioned that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.420" end="00:57:00.020" style="s2">tough for you is there anything else</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.619" end="00:57:01.190" style="s2">that would make that easier no we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.020" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">to create it from scratch for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.190" end="00:57:05.080" style="s2">something I think that works the best I</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:08.690" style="s2">mean a bit of it release it for now</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.080" end="00:57:10.730" style="s2">allowing that we are the document right</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.690" end="00:57:12.770" style="s2">like a part of the idea cafe and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.730" end="00:57:13.940" style="s2">World Cafe is that you&#39;re the one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.770" end="00:57:15.800" style="s2">bringing that knowledge to the next</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.940" end="00:57:17.570" style="s2">group you&#39;re the piece that changed to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.800" end="00:57:19.910" style="s2">bring it to the next conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.570" end="00:57:21.859" style="s2">then harvesting it and getting those</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.910" end="00:57:25.940" style="s2">things to be in a way there will be</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.859" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">people who their passion is diagramming</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.940" end="00:57:28.910" style="s2">right and those people might need to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:30.170" style="s2">paid those people might need the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.910" end="00:57:31.250" style="s2">incentive because there might be I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.170" end="00:57:33.020" style="s2">know how what percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.250" end="00:57:35.210" style="s2">population they are they might not want</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.020" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">to harvest and documents right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.210" end="00:57:38.060" style="s2">finding the more you need people to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:40.340" style="s2">one and the other</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.060" end="00:57:44.210" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to find people but having</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.340" end="00:57:45.800" style="s2">people right like if we need a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.210" end="00:57:47.030" style="s2">documentary because those documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.800" end="00:57:49.130" style="s2">that need to get together and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.030" end="00:57:49.910" style="s2">figure out how to make one thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.130" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.910" end="00:57:53.000" style="s2">right out to ever and be like this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.130" style="s2">what that conversation generated right</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.000" end="00:57:57.140" style="s2">this is how we like build on it from one</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.130" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">to the next but the bigger piece is</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.140" end="00:58:01.609" style="s2">we&#39;re the build on from one to the next</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:02.660" style="s2">how did you grow what did you learn and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.609" end="00:58:07.849" style="s2">how do you bring that to your next</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.660" end="00:58:09.589" style="s2">conversation and so if we that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.849" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">let&#39;s leave it without that let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.589" end="00:58:17.049" style="s2">about it without having any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">document I&#39;d like to explore that a bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.049" end="00:58:23.930" style="s2">then do we need in order for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:30.410" style="s2">knowledge to grow and spread do we need</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.930" end="00:58:32.329" style="s2">to have a group like if we take four</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.410" end="00:58:35.059" style="s2">groups and switch everyone around tour</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.329" end="00:58:36.530" style="s2">no one&#39;s with anyone they had before do</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.059" end="00:58:40.430" style="s2">they need to actually talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.530" end="00:58:43.549" style="s2">same question or a very similar question</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.430" end="00:58:46.549" style="s2">so that the information gets shared and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.549" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">built the idea is yes because then</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.549" end="00:58:49.789" style="s2">you&#39;re part of the same conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:50.869" style="s2">like then you can kind of know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.789" end="00:58:52.789" style="s2">other people are having that same</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.869" end="00:58:54.770" style="s2">conversation and then you know that even</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.789" end="00:58:56.990" style="s2">if you weren&#39;t part of that you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.770" end="00:58:58.369" style="s2">both had a similar conversation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.990" end="00:59:00.349" style="s2">then bringing in to the next one and</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.369" end="00:59:02.180" style="s2">saying hey like you&#39;re also bringing</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.349" end="00:59:03.650" style="s2">that into it literally like hey so what</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.180" end="00:59:05.900" style="s2">so and so said this that resonates with</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.650" end="00:59:07.849" style="s2">this right like you&#39;re you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.900" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">physically like I might take notes right</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.849" end="00:59:11.539" style="s2">I might take my own notes to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">understand it myself and I bring those</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.539" end="00:59:14.990" style="s2">with me to the next table and it World</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.789" style="s2">Cafe format there is a host who is</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.990" end="00:59:18.410" style="s2">taking notes and they stay they stay at</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.789" end="00:59:20.119" style="s2">the table so that one person physically</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.410" end="00:59:22.430" style="s2">is there all the time and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.119" end="00:59:25.369" style="s2">rotates around that&#39;s not really virtual</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.430" end="00:59:27.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way because it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.369" end="00:59:30.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just not how it zoom works well we</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.319" end="00:59:33.770" style="s2">need to let the conversation evolve even</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.890" end="00:59:36.170" style="s2">because they can you can start with a</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.770" end="00:59:38.380" style="s2">question and that question can easily</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.170" end="00:59:41.000" style="s2">lead to something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.380" end="00:59:43.490" style="s2">extraordinary and doesn&#39;t really relate</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.000" end="00:59:46.789" style="s2">to the initial question after three or</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.490" end="00:59:48.380" style="s2">four groups had their meetings and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.789" end="00:59:51.710" style="s2">conversation has completely evolved</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.380" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">somewhere else that is a very game B</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.710" end="00:59:56.750" style="s2">space which has been awesome like with</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:58.069" style="s2">the wormhole group where it was like hey</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.750" end="00:59:59.390" style="s2">like someone would talk I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.069" end="01:00:00.740" style="s2">like 15 of us on the call and the next</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.390" end="01:00:02.540" style="s2">person would just start from that point</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.740" end="01:00:04.100" style="s2">it was really cool but</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.540" end="01:00:05.240" style="s2">know how it moves forward it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.100" end="01:00:06.860" style="s2">idea is to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.240" end="01:00:09.530" style="s2">conversation with thousands or even</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.860" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">millions of people around the world in</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.530" end="01:00:11.780" style="s2">different time periods where you feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:13.610" style="s2">like you were part of something because</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.780" end="01:00:15.410" style="s2">you all had the same conversation even</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.610" end="01:00:18.140" style="s2">if it was with different people and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.410" end="01:00:19.880" style="s2">you&#39;re generating a new question that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.140" end="01:00:21.260" style="s2">that might evolve into right like oh</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.880" end="01:00:22.340" style="s2">that brings up this question I would</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.260" end="01:00:23.930" style="s2">love to discuss and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.340" end="01:00:25.820" style="s2">submitting that and voting on it to see</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.930" end="01:00:27.470" style="s2">whether you all want to talk like</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.820" end="01:00:33.830" style="s2">whichever question kind of resonates the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.470" end="01:00:37.580" style="s2">most with you yeah so if you have so</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.830" end="01:00:39.350" style="s2">imagine that during the wormhole someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.580" end="01:00:41.780" style="s2">talks about because the idea is you</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.350" end="01:00:43.280" style="s2">don&#39;t interrupt other people so somebody</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.780" end="01:00:46.510" style="s2">is talking about something that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.280" end="01:00:50.930" style="s2">important you create a tag on that</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.510" end="01:00:51.740" style="s2">second of the video that in the end of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.930" end="01:00:54.440" style="s2">the wormhole</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.740" end="01:00:58.070" style="s2">everyone goes backs watches the tags</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.440" end="01:01:04.760" style="s2">tries to extrapolate the actual idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.070" end="01:01:07.370" style="s2">into a document let&#39;s say and then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.760" end="01:01:09.110" style="s2">can look at all the other things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.370" end="01:01:11.540" style="s2">got pulled out of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.110" end="01:01:15.350" style="s2">conversation try to organize them in</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.540" end="01:01:19.850" style="s2">some way in that funnels out into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.350" end="01:01:23.030" style="s2">other conversations that&#39;s good idea let</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.850" end="01:01:26.540" style="s2">me take a quick step back though for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.030" end="01:01:28.460" style="s2">automated talking stick for the talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.540" end="01:01:30.740" style="s2">stick what are what were the rules on</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.460" end="01:01:33.140" style="s2">that is it five minutes per person no</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.740" end="01:01:35.510" style="s2">that was the idea cafes I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.140" end="01:01:37.070" style="s2">you just cuz you&#39;re in for people you</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.510" end="01:01:38.510" style="s2">know you have 20 minutes so you want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.070" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">make sure everyone has a chance to talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.510" end="01:01:42.380" style="s2">they generally let you go till you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:43.820" style="s2">done but like there are people who will</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.380" end="01:01:45.290" style="s2">talk for 20 minutes and there are people</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.820" end="01:01:46.850" style="s2">who will talk for 30 seconds there are</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.290" end="01:01:48.860" style="s2">people that don&#39;t want to talk and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.850" end="01:01:50.660" style="s2">think it&#39;s the idea cafe it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.860" end="01:01:51.740" style="s2">because you&#39;re answering a question and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.660" end="01:01:52.820" style="s2">the people don&#39;t know each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.740" end="01:01:55.070" style="s2">like you literally just answer that</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.820" end="01:01:56.810" style="s2">question and take turns and then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.070" end="01:01:59.480" style="s2">have a brief conversation again which</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.810" end="01:02:01.220" style="s2">seems to be an enjoyable experience and</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.480" end="01:02:02.330" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to understand right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.220" end="01:02:03.200" style="s2">you talk for five minutes and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.330" end="01:02:05.840" style="s2">done you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.200" end="01:02:08.270" style="s2">the next person talks and it&#39;s even and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.840" end="01:02:11.090" style="s2">then you can monopolize or in monopolize</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.270" end="01:02:12.470" style="s2">in the last last part of it when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.090" end="01:02:15.990" style="s2">were thinking through this what was your</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.470" end="01:02:17.160" style="s2">thought on is there a process that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.990" end="01:02:18.600" style="s2">of the five minutes but that&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.160" end="01:02:19.560" style="s2">that&#39;s how my mind works I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.600" end="01:02:20.730" style="s2">interrupt people when they have five</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.560" end="01:02:22.740" style="s2">minutes and I do when we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.730" end="01:02:24.210" style="s2">conversation despite like having rules</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.740" end="01:02:27.150" style="s2">for my brain but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.210" end="01:02:29.460" style="s2">has to be the iteration well so yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.150" end="01:02:31.530" style="s2">I kind of like that idea as well</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.460" end="01:02:34.020" style="s2">and I almost but I do like having an</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.530" end="01:02:35.460" style="s2">open discussion period I don&#39;t know five</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.020" end="01:02:39.060" style="s2">minutes I mean I&#39;m almost thinking like</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.460" end="01:02:41.460" style="s2">I mean and and of course we can flex</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.060" end="01:02:43.950" style="s2">these numbers as much as we want but</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.460" end="01:02:47.580" style="s2">like three minutes per person and then a</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.950" end="01:02:49.140" style="s2">10 20 minute a 10 minute group</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.580" end="01:02:51.630" style="s2">discussion which I don&#39;t know if made us</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.140" end="01:02:54.450" style="s2">not long enough the idea was for them to</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.630" end="01:02:56.100" style="s2">be half an hour total so that this 24</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.450" end="01:02:58.470" style="s2">hour conversation but that&#39;s if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.100" end="01:03:01.080" style="s2">starting with for time period like you I</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.470" end="01:03:02.640" style="s2">saying so for certain questions half an</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.080" end="01:03:03.570" style="s2">hour&#39;s not enough in five minutes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.640" end="01:03:05.340" style="s2">enough when we&#39;re telling our life</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.570" end="01:03:07.350" style="s2">stories and we&#39;re telling about like our</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.340" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">brain tumors story five minutes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.350" end="01:03:09.930" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:11.820" style="s2">and then the conversation also isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.930" end="01:03:13.020" style="s2">enough it&#39;s like no forever when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.820" end="01:03:15.630" style="s2">talking about something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.020" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">emotional and more like you I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.630" end="01:03:19.560" style="s2">it would just feel like a long time to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">talk for five minutes I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.560" end="01:03:24.210" style="s2">topic dependent and we&#39;ll have to find</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:26.760" style="s2">the sweet spot for people talking about</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.210" end="01:03:28.980" style="s2">the topics we&#39;re choosing to move idea</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.760" end="01:03:31.410" style="s2">cafe and the next project their tech</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.980" end="01:03:33.450" style="s2">forward and maybe just these I mean I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.410" end="01:03:35.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s good to have a max time like</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.450" end="01:03:40.980" style="s2">you said because some people find it</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.400" end="01:03:43.530" style="s2">difficult to regulate and then so and</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.980" end="01:03:48.930" style="s2">then yeah that&#39;s that number of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.530" end="01:03:52.109" style="s2">number of minutes we can we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.930" end="01:03:53.850" style="s2">not something just came up to when</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.109" end="01:03:58.890" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about that so imagine</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.850" end="01:04:02.460" style="s2">this you have the five minutes but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.890" end="01:04:05.460" style="s2">more of a guide the person starts</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.460" end="01:04:07.410" style="s2">talking the five minutes are up the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.460" end="01:04:09.990" style="s2">other people involved in in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.410" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">discussion receives and for a visual</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.990" end="01:04:18.750" style="s2">warning that tells them that the person</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:21.660" style="s2">has already talked for five minutes and</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.750" end="01:04:23.340" style="s2">let them decide if they&#39;re in if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.660" end="01:04:25.950" style="s2">talking about something interesting or</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.340" end="01:04:28.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just going down the drain so this</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.950" end="01:04:29.740" style="s2">week yeah and if they&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.680" end="01:04:31.900" style="s2">something interesting they</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.740" end="01:04:33.460" style="s2">won&#39;t do anything if they see that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.900" end="01:04:34.930" style="s2">they&#39;re going off-topic or something</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.460" end="01:04:38.619" style="s2">like that they&#39;ll just press a button</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.930" end="01:04:40.920" style="s2">that puts out the signal and the person</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.619" end="01:04:44.680" style="s2">talking starts seeing some sort of graph</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.920" end="01:04:46.990" style="s2">growing and and it will come to their</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.680" end="01:04:50.010" style="s2">attention see okay I need to stop</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.990" end="01:04:52.360" style="s2">talking I&#39;ve gone off track or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.010" end="01:04:53.650" style="s2">yeah I mean I think that&#39;s valid there</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.360" end="01:04:55.060" style="s2">are times where that&#39;s absolutely you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.650" end="01:04:56.770" style="s2">like this person needs to share more</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.060" end="01:05:01.360" style="s2">they are like I&#39;m cutting them off see</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.770" end="01:05:04.210" style="s2">me not help we need to be very mindful</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.360" end="01:05:09.730" style="s2">that this conversation is is the goal we</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.210" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">need to cherish conversation like this</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.730" end="01:05:12.970" style="s2">is the format I&#39;ve done it in and so I</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:14.380" style="s2">would come on like I would have just you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.970" end="01:05:15.880" style="s2">up on the screen when you&#39;re talking and</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.380" end="01:05:17.290" style="s2">then I would come back on you would know</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.880" end="01:05:19.650" style="s2">your five minutes is up but I would let</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.290" end="01:05:19.650" style="s2">you finish</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:28.510" style="s2">stop talking mid-sentence I thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.460" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">about that one but just in in in the in</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.510" end="01:05:32.800" style="s2">the brain of a person as soon as you see</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:36.010" style="s2">someone else appearing it could cancel</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.800" end="01:05:39.160" style="s2">the idea in their head break the</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.010" end="01:05:41.859" style="s2">conversation yeah and by doing it like I</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.160" end="01:05:46.420" style="s2">was saying it it doesn&#39;t send any signal</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.859" end="01:05:48.670" style="s2">to the person who&#39;s actually talking and</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.420" end="01:05:52.590" style="s2">only it allows the other person the</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.670" end="01:05:55.210" style="s2">other people who have more mind space to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.590" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">handle that because my issue with that</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.210" end="01:05:59.890" style="s2">would be only some people know when</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:02.560" style="s2">they&#39;ve talked for five minutes right</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.890" end="01:06:03.880" style="s2">like so because we all are very bad at</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.560" end="01:06:05.230" style="s2">guesstimating when we&#39;ve talked for five</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.880" end="01:06:06.790" style="s2">minutes some of us are gonna talk over</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.230" end="01:06:07.960" style="s2">five minutes just not knowing we hit</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.790" end="01:06:09.400" style="s2">five minutes and some of us are going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.960" end="01:06:10.780" style="s2">wait underestimate and stop at two</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.400" end="01:06:12.820" style="s2">minutes thinking we used up our five</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.780" end="01:06:14.260" style="s2">minutes and so just based on whether</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.820" end="01:06:16.030" style="s2">you&#39;re an under overestimate or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.260" end="01:06:18.310" style="s2">gonna get more or less time to talk and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.030" end="01:06:22.900" style="s2">so knowing that like like here there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.310" end="01:06:24.490" style="s2">counter on the screen that says my voice</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.900" end="01:06:26.320" style="s2">starts maybe there&#39;s a counter I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.490" end="01:06:28.510" style="s2">would love in a later version to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.320" end="01:06:29.380" style="s2">actually able to see my metrics right to</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.510" end="01:06:31.510" style="s2">be able to say hey you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.380" end="01:06:32.920" style="s2">authorize that conversation right</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.510" end="01:06:35.650" style="s2">where&#39;s right now let&#39;s just do I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.920" end="01:06:38.710" style="s2">I monopolize it I suppose - how much is</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.650" end="01:06:41.230" style="s2">actually monopolized it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.710" end="01:06:43.530" style="s2">that hard to make and yeah I think you</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.230" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">that time we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.530" end="01:06:52.390" style="s2">has a place there so do we still want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:53.890" style="s2">have a unregulated group discussion time</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.390" end="01:06:57.790" style="s2">or do you think it should always be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.890" end="01:06:59.380" style="s2">talking stick oh no all right because</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.790" end="01:07:01.300" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it it&#39;s like when the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.380" end="01:07:02.890" style="s2">magic happens been like you say</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.300" end="01:07:05.470" style="s2">something I say something we share and</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.890" end="01:07:07.660" style="s2">then it&#39;s like the after part of like</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.470" end="01:07:10.570" style="s2">the first idea cafe I had was a was on</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.660" end="01:07:13.210" style="s2">911 and we were sharing our 911 stories</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.570" end="01:07:16.180" style="s2">and me and my friend I&#39;ve known for</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.210" end="01:07:17.800" style="s2">forever have acquaintances more and she</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.180" end="01:07:18.970" style="s2">talked about being in Greece and not</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.800" end="01:07:20.980" style="s2">speaking the language and she&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.970" end="01:07:22.690" style="s2">Britain and I was in Australia when it</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.980" end="01:07:24.430" style="s2">happens and I spoke the language but we</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.690" end="01:07:26.920" style="s2">both had this experience of travelling</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.430" end="01:07:28.390" style="s2">into a foreign country in one world and</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.920" end="01:07:29.860" style="s2">traveling out in another world and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.390" end="01:07:31.630" style="s2">third person who&#39;d already agreed to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.860" end="01:07:34.000" style="s2">part of it for it was even about 9/11</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.630" end="01:07:35.440" style="s2">and I said yes we can trade it happened</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.000" end="01:07:37.330" style="s2">to have been in New York at the time and</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.440" end="01:07:38.740" style="s2">so part of the magic was that those</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.330" end="01:07:40.300" style="s2">three people were the ones that showed</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.740" end="01:07:42.280" style="s2">up and also the conversation we had</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.300" end="01:07:44.560" style="s2">after of like oh look at this connection</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.280" end="01:07:46.810" style="s2">and look at the third piece and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.560" end="01:07:49.630" style="s2">know if that happens and the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.810" end="01:07:51.220" style="s2">together tech space but that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.630" end="01:07:52.660" style="s2">the magic it&#39;s like oh that resonated</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.220" end="01:07:55.360" style="s2">this in me and it brought up this and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.660" end="01:07:56.410" style="s2">like you&#39;re one of the other ones in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.360" end="01:07:57.670" style="s2">world cafe when I don&#39;t even remember</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.410" end="01:07:59.080" style="s2">someone had like growing up in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.670" end="01:08:00.100" style="s2">prairies in Canada it was like I&#39;m from</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.080" end="01:08:01.450" style="s2">the Prairie something was and her</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.100" end="01:08:02.980" style="s2">husband was from the other place the</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.450" end="01:08:04.900" style="s2">other third person was from it was it</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.980" end="01:08:07.540" style="s2">just like those things happen constantly</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.900" end="01:08:10.030" style="s2">and seeing that is part of how humanity</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.540" end="01:08:11.830" style="s2">connects and if it&#39;s that&#39;s a piece of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.030" end="01:08:14.020" style="s2">what the idea Cafe is is connecting</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.830" end="01:08:18.640" style="s2">humanity even if we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.020" end="01:08:20.490" style="s2">together tech that&#39;s that that makes me</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.640" end="01:08:24.339" style="s2">think when you talk about connecting</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.490" end="01:08:29.470" style="s2">humanity we would want a function that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.339" end="01:08:31.780" style="s2">allows people to communicate afterwards</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.470" end="01:08:34.720" style="s2">if we could be randomly putting people</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.780" end="01:08:37.330" style="s2">together do we want to have something</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.720" end="01:08:39.430" style="s2">like a double opt in trading personal</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.330" end="01:08:42.430" style="s2">information yeah I think that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.430" end="01:08:44.859" style="s2">yeah I think another option which might</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.430" end="01:08:47.049" style="s2">not be big enough for sure is that some</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.859" end="01:08:48.760" style="s2">people are gonna want a focused group</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.049" end="01:08:50.260" style="s2">that it&#39;s the same people they talk with</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.760" end="01:08:52.240" style="s2">again and again or let&#39;s say if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.260" end="01:08:54.430" style="s2">like twenty five people they talk with</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.240" end="01:08:55.870" style="s2">way more often so that they feel more</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.430" end="01:08:57.190" style="s2">comfortable want to participate but then</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.870" end="01:08:58.810" style="s2">there also needs to be a bigger call</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.190" end="01:09:01.239" style="s2">verse Asian as long as some people are</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.810" end="01:09:03.880" style="s2">transferring I think that&#39;s effective</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.239" end="01:09:05.230" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s about finding what works</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.880" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">for the individual right what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.230" end="01:09:09.759" style="s2">keep bringing them back to the table</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:11.799" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna be the most beneficial and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.759" end="01:09:13.690" style="s2">I think some people I love random and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.799" end="01:09:15.489" style="s2">love the group setting I kind of want</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.690" end="01:09:16.930" style="s2">both of them and I want you know a small</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.489" end="01:09:18.819" style="s2">group of people that we can keep because</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.930" end="01:09:19.870" style="s2">then you generate a project and</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.819" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">eventually we have the tools to make a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.870" end="01:09:24.100" style="s2">project and you figure out the people</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:24.819" style="s2">that you mesh well with and want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.100" end="01:09:26.739" style="s2">connect with them</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.819" end="01:09:28.270" style="s2">there have been game beast conversations</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.739" end="01:09:31.029" style="s2">for sure I&#39;m like how do I contact him</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.270" end="01:09:32.620" style="s2">or her and then like how and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.029" end="01:09:34.359" style="s2">way to do it besides finding them in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.620" end="01:09:38.350" style="s2">game be Facebook and then going through</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.359" end="01:09:41.219" style="s2">it and I feel like it would be very easy</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.350" end="01:09:45.160" style="s2">to create something like that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.219" end="01:09:49.799" style="s2">and I just call attention to earnest who</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.160" end="01:09:49.799" style="s2">is saying about that extra time thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:56.440" style="s2">what is it was sorry that he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.589" end="01:10:00.310" style="s2">about the system like chess we have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.440" end="01:10:02.560" style="s2">fine finite amount of time and then he</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.310" end="01:10:08.340" style="s2">talks to the next one he says you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.560" end="01:10:11.560" style="s2">give extra time at some at a cost that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.340" end="01:10:15.900" style="s2">cost could be the motivational thing I</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.560" end="01:10:18.219" style="s2">was talking about for example an idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.900" end="01:10:20.230" style="s2">someone like Jordan Hall or one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.219" end="01:10:21.670" style="s2">Weinsteins is on right and to be like</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.230" end="01:10:23.290" style="s2">like maybe we want to hear them talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.670" end="01:10:25.060" style="s2">more and so we end up getting a time</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.290" end="01:10:26.710" style="s2">which wouldn&#39;t be the worst they could</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.060" end="01:10:31.090" style="s2">do as monopolize half an hour right</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.710" end="01:10:35.050" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think I need to want to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.090" end="01:10:38.110" style="s2">it - yeah people can give you extra time</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.050" end="01:10:38.410" style="s2">at their own cost ramai on this there we</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.110" end="01:10:42.550" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.410" end="01:10:43.660" style="s2">i THS can we call it that because that</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.550" end="01:10:47.020" style="s2">seems a little more combative though</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.660" end="01:10:50.620" style="s2">that maybe we want to be yeah doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.020" end="01:10:52.690" style="s2">imply a game be space no but but like I</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.620" end="01:10:54.070" style="s2">do think back and forth though there</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.690" end="01:10:56.380" style="s2">could be an option that brings people</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.070" end="01:10:57.880" style="s2">from game into game B that is like idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.380" end="01:10:59.590" style="s2">chess where people feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.880" end="01:11:11.070" style="s2">getting at a debate but aren&#39;t getting</p>

<p begin="01:11:16.200" end="01:11:28.290" style="s2">the harvesting I don&#39;t feel that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.790" end="01:11:30.360" style="s2">enough stored value I just kind of think</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.290" end="01:11:32.280" style="s2">so you know we have you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.360" end="01:11:34.500" style="s2">we get a billion people involved if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.280" end="01:11:39.750" style="s2">gonna meet with all of them at four at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.500" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">time right all right let&#39;s say what how</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.750" end="01:11:45.930" style="s2">many meetings would I have to have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:49.050" style="s2">meet with someone who has met with you</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.930" end="01:11:52.260" style="s2">know to where the communication could</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.050" end="01:11:54.930" style="s2">have gone through all the groups Turin</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.260" end="01:11:57.510" style="s2">idea has has a good idea that only one</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.930" end="01:11:59.820" style="s2">person had could spread to a majority of</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.510" end="01:12:02.820" style="s2">the group I&#39;m just trying to think of is</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.820" end="01:12:05.580" style="s2">there any other way we want to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.820" end="01:12:07.560" style="s2">harvest I think yes absolutely well</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.580" end="01:12:08.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a magic idea that someone had in</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.560" end="01:12:10.500" style="s2">a group you&#39;re like that needs to be up</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.850" end="01:12:11.970" style="s2">voted everyone needs to hear that if</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.500" end="01:12:13.290" style="s2">there was a way to pull that out and</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.970" end="01:12:15.300" style="s2">share it with everyone like if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.290" end="01:12:19.080" style="s2">recorded for I don&#39;t we can&#39;t record in</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.300" end="01:12:20.760" style="s2">Zune so that makes it like yeah so why</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.080" end="01:12:23.490" style="s2">don&#39;t the idea I&#39;m toying with so help</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.760" end="01:12:24.870" style="s2">me I&#39;m shaped this if you have any ideas</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.490" end="01:12:26.670" style="s2">is that maybe at the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.870" end="01:12:28.140" style="s2">conversation we asked them either as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.670" end="01:12:32.310" style="s2">group or as individuals you know give us</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.140" end="01:12:33.690" style="s2">one or two sentences or ideas that came</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.310" end="01:12:36.150" style="s2">out of the group and then that would be</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.690" end="01:12:39.150" style="s2">the thing that we feedback or we look</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.150" end="01:12:42.240" style="s2">for correlations with other ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.150" end="01:12:45.720" style="s2">then maybe even a different group of</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.240" end="01:12:47.700" style="s2">people get together later on or another</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.720" end="01:12:49.440" style="s2">that I had was that you have that kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.700" end="01:12:50.970" style="s2">of time where you have the time where</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.440" end="01:12:52.620" style="s2">each person talks and then you have the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.970" end="01:12:55.230" style="s2">time where everyone can talk together</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.620" end="01:12:59.940" style="s2">and then maybe at that point there then</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.230" end="01:13:01.650" style="s2">we give them like the top five ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.940" end="01:13:03.930" style="s2">then give another period of time for</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.650" end="01:13:05.850" style="s2">them to discuss the ideas that have come</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.930" end="01:13:08.630" style="s2">from other from you know the complete</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.850" end="01:13:11.970" style="s2">history of all the groups before them</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.630" end="01:13:13.800" style="s2">interesting another option I had was um</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.970" end="01:13:15.750" style="s2">so if we are doing it like a 24 hour</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.800" end="01:13:18.240" style="s2">time period or something or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.750" end="01:13:21.840" style="s2">time period it is to be able to say okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.240" end="01:13:23.610" style="s2">well these people had great like almost</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.840" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">like people audition to be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.610" end="01:13:26.739" style="s2">harvesting team and</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:28.540" style="s2">so it would be on video like it would be</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.739" end="01:13:30.580" style="s2">like hey these people so if you wanted</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.540" end="01:13:31.960" style="s2">to watch it that&#39;s part of what you</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.580" end="01:13:33.730" style="s2">watch then right is people having a</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.960" end="01:13:35.290" style="s2">conversation about hey what did I get</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.730" end="01:13:36.969" style="s2">out of those conversations is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.290" end="01:13:38.920" style="s2">only like four people or maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.969" end="01:13:41.139" style="s2">multiple conversations going on they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.920" end="01:13:42.580" style="s2">all recorded and I&#39;ll put out there I</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.139" end="01:13:44.739" style="s2">don&#39;t know how well that works for the</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.580" end="01:13:48.610" style="s2">actual harvesting part and the beam so I</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.739" end="01:13:50.290" style="s2">have I have an idea they might be in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.610" end="01:13:53.620" style="s2">beginning would be complicated but they</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.290" end="01:13:57.850" style="s2">might be interesting to do it when the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.620" end="01:14:02.920" style="s2">system is already going you can have</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.850" end="01:14:05.139" style="s2">some sort of reporter so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.920" end="01:14:06.880" style="s2">someone that&#39;s act watching for</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.139" end="01:14:10.380" style="s2">highlights of a specific conversation</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.880" end="01:14:15.100" style="s2">and then just splits it up into small</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.380" end="01:14:16.960" style="s2">snippets so people can review it a</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.100" end="01:14:20.440" style="s2">little bit faster and absorb other</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.960" end="01:14:23.409" style="s2">conversations it might have missed the</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.440" end="01:14:27.250" style="s2">topics that came out of them not you</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.409" end="01:14:29.710" style="s2">know because sometimes there&#39;s things</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.250" end="01:14:31.650" style="s2">that people say that don&#39;t connect to</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.710" end="01:14:37.870" style="s2">you but will connect someone else</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.650" end="01:14:40.179" style="s2">and they might they may not be in</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.870" end="01:14:44.469" style="s2">pointed in the in the topics that come</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.179" end="01:14:46.860" style="s2">out of each conversation and by having</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.469" end="01:14:49.090" style="s2">some sort of snippets of each</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.860" end="01:14:54.400" style="s2">conversation that other people can</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.090" end="01:15:00.400" style="s2">review we maintain the value of each</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.400" end="01:15:05.590" style="s2">conversation for later processing kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.400" end="01:15:06.909" style="s2">of thing yeah that was one of them last</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.590" end="01:15:08.139" style="s2">what it was together tech I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.909" end="01:15:10.060" style="s2">how that would work for that particular</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.139" end="01:15:13.060" style="s2">but when it was like more of a how we</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.060" end="01:15:14.560" style="s2">create social media for connection but</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.060" end="01:15:15.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re sharing a story and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.560" end="01:15:16.989" style="s2">just essentially that&#39;s broken this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.760" end="01:15:18.909" style="s2">part of why it was broken up into five</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.989" end="01:15:20.290" style="s2">minutes without the discussion is if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.909" end="01:15:22.540" style="s2">sharing my story of how I met the love</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.290" end="01:15:24.790" style="s2">of my life how I came across having to</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.540" end="01:15:26.290" style="s2">try it whatever it is by addiction story</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.790" end="01:15:29.739" style="s2">that I&#39;m telling it a five minute</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.290" end="01:15:31.270" style="s2">increment in it for me and it&#39;s less of</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.739" end="01:15:32.650" style="s2">a higher key and following like on</p>
