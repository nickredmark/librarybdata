<p begin="00:00:05.150" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">welcome to the latest rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">podcast I&#39;m really excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">one because it&#39;s some of the best</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:16.830" style="s2">interviews that we&#39;ve done recently that</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:18.600" style="s2">we&#39;re making live at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.830" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">we&#39;re releasing this I&#39;m going to show</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.600" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">some clips from them and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">theme and the theme is masculinity and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">guess the sub theme is it&#39;s what about a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:33.980" style="s2">year now since me too and since a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">these gender dynamics started becoming</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.980" end="00:00:37.770" style="s2">really prevalent and really part of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">culture and that&#39;s been a big theme of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:41.399" style="s2">lot of the stuff that we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">so what we&#39;ve got coming up at the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">time is two interviews and another round</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">of content probably bout a week after</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">that so we have an interview with Cassie</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">J who directed the red pill film and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve got into Warren Farrell who is</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">often called the father of the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">movement but I think our experience when</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">we met him in America and interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">him is that he&#39;s got a lot more to offer</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">than that sort of characterization he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.210" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">a therapist he does couples counseling</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">he&#39;s deeply interested in how to create</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">healthy relationships and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">ultimately I think is the theme of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:28.700" style="s2">of the content we&#39;re putting out is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">if if what we&#39;re seeing at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.700" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">tantamount to a kind of dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">relationship between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">playing out on the wider cultural stage</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:38.490" style="s2">what does a healthy relationship look</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:40.740" style="s2">like kind of linked to what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.490" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">discussing recently around the shadow I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.740" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">think along with that question is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">is the shadow of masculinity but then</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">also less discussed what is the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">of femininity and I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:57.930" style="s2">this but before I think about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:00.290" style="s2">actually because the shadow of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.930" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">masculine that that was the me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.290" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">movement as well was kind of showing up</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:06.020" style="s2">the shadow of the masculine which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">obviously something that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.020" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">the shadow of the feminine is harder to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:14.210" style="s2">pin down I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:15.590" style="s2">if you look at it in if you were to take</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.210" end="00:02:18.890" style="s2">it just as a thought experiment in kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.590" end="00:02:21.560" style="s2">of Taoist terms and you had each</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.890" end="00:02:23.420" style="s2">opposite implies the other but there</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.560" end="00:02:26.180" style="s2">really have to be opposite so if you see</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.420" end="00:02:28.820" style="s2">and they would in kind of Chinese towers</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.180" end="00:02:31.910" style="s2">and they see the masculine is obvious</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.820" end="00:02:34.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s bright and it&#39;s right there</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.910" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">so the masculine shadow would be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.250" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">same it&#39;s so clear it&#39;s domination it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">controlled it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of its</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:43.160" style="s2">aggressive it&#39;s all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:47.030" style="s2">are quite easy to look at and easy to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.160" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">define absolutely so by by that then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.030" end="00:02:51.709" style="s2">shadow of the feminine should</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:55.130" style="s2">automatically be shrouded mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.709" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">complex and I think that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.130" end="00:02:58.670" style="s2">powerful things about the red pill in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:03.370" style="s2">the whole phenomena of red pilling is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.670" end="00:03:05.450" style="s2">that it lifts a veil on AHA Wade this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.370" end="00:03:06.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense with the red pill I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.450" end="00:03:10.280" style="s2">think that a lot of people have watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.770" end="00:03:13.459" style="s2">it I certainly did where I had a sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.280" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">of were the very water the very cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.459" end="00:03:17.750" style="s2">water I was swimming in is not what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:22.100" style="s2">appear to be I think it I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.750" end="00:03:24.320" style="s2">interject here because we&#39;re two men</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.100" end="00:03:26.269" style="s2">talking about the female shadow what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.320" end="00:03:27.350" style="s2">want to say and what I think is really</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.269" end="00:03:29.750" style="s2">interesting about the content we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.350" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">coming up because we&#39;ve got there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.750" end="00:03:35.989" style="s2">film done by a friend of ours Hannah who</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:38.120" style="s2">did this film called from women to men</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.989" end="00:03:39.739" style="s2">all about the female shadow and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.120" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">got a long interview with her and a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.739" end="00:03:42.769" style="s2">interview with a couple of the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.760" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">women who appeared in that film about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.769" end="00:03:47.180" style="s2">the female shadow and about their</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:49.340" style="s2">ownership of of the ways they&#39;ve acted</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.180" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">out and I think what&#39;s interesting as</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.340" end="00:03:52.820" style="s2">well now is that there is a cultural as</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:56.570" style="s2">I said we&#39;re about a year after me too</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.820" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">and I think the cultural conversation is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.570" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">now at this point of recognizing we had</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:05.660" style="s2">me to this kind of essential voicing of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.410" end="00:04:07.220" style="s2">a lot of suppressed anger or a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.660" end="00:04:09.799" style="s2">suppress a lot of boundary setting by</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:12.500" style="s2">women saying no this is not acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.799" end="00:04:15.890" style="s2">behavior and where we are now especially</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.500" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">with Asia Argento one of the prime</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.890" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">movers of the me to movement has the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">has turned out to be it looks a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:30.110" style="s2">predator herself who&#39;d paid off an</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:32.009" style="s2">underaged guy that she&#39;d slept with and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.110" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">there was a really interesting article</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.009" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">quite recently by Barry Weiss in the New</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">York Times where she said this shows</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">that women are human too which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">basically what a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">wanted to hear it&#39;s like this this very</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:51.949" style="s2">simplistic dynamic of women as only</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">victims and men as only perpetrators is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.949" end="00:04:58.050" style="s2">such a one-sided dynamic and now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:02.090" style="s2">cultural conversation seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.050" end="00:05:06.629" style="s2">swung to to this this place where we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.090" end="00:05:09.330" style="s2">hopefully allowed to say men have a dark</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.629" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">side women have a dark side and it can</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:12.689" style="s2">now be a more balanced conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.689" end="00:05:14.849" style="s2">about the content we&#39;re putting out</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">because I think we&#39;re asking that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.849" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">question and we&#39;re also asking</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:22.439" style="s2">especially in the response to the red</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:26.279" style="s2">pill like there&#39;s one thing as the film</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.439" end="00:05:28.379" style="s2">and the the other thing is the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.279" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">response to the film and the incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.379" end="00:05:31.949" style="s2">harsh reception that it got from a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">of media platforms especially millennial</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.949" end="00:05:37.169" style="s2">platforms like Vox and Vice I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:40.620" style="s2">red pill is a very controversial film</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.169" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">and there were quite a few things said</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.620" end="00:05:44.009" style="s2">about it and it was when we were in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">America interviewing Warren Farrell and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.009" end="00:05:48.569" style="s2">he happens to be a neighbor of Cassie J</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">the the woman who made it and Cassie J</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.569" end="00:05:51.689" style="s2">still describes herself as a liberal she</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">was a feminist when she went into making</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.689" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">the film and I I had a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:06:02.449" style="s2">suspicion as a filmmaker watching it it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:04.589" style="s2">just seemed so convenient that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.449" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">self-described feminist would go inside</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.589" end="00:06:08.099" style="s2">the men&#39;s rights movement and have her</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.029" style="s2">mind changed by what she found and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.099" end="00:06:10.379" style="s2">have to say I was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.029" end="00:06:14.909" style="s2">suspicious about that I was a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.379" end="00:06:18.599" style="s2">suspicious about how how it was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.909" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">perfect narrative and speaking to Warren</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.599" end="00:06:22.620" style="s2">and this was unprompted I wasn&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:24.029" style="s2">we weren&#39;t interrogating him about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.620" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">Kathy&#39;s journey or anything like that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.029" end="00:06:29.399" style="s2">just volunteered that Cassie had come to</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:31.800" style="s2">him and said I went in I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.399" end="00:06:32.860" style="s2">something we were an expose on the men&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.860" end="00:06:38.710" style="s2">and even when she interviewed them she</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.729" end="00:06:40.750" style="s2">had in the back of her mind a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.710" end="00:06:42.699" style="s2">feminist talking points and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.750" end="00:06:45.099" style="s2">arguments without the way of saying and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.699" end="00:06:47.680" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until she started watching the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.099" end="00:06:49.389" style="s2">the rushes back watching the the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.680" end="00:06:51.969" style="s2">film back the footage to make the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.389" end="00:06:53.590" style="s2">documentary that she started listening</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.969" end="00:06:54.819" style="s2">more to what they were saying and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.590" end="00:06:56.770" style="s2">understanding what they were saying and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.819" end="00:06:58.389" style="s2">came out with an appreciation of wow</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.770" end="00:07:01.300" style="s2">there are some men&#39;s stories that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.389" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">not being heard there are some struggles</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.300" end="00:07:03.639" style="s2">that men are having that are not being</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:08.159" style="s2">heard and are not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.639" end="00:07:12.909" style="s2">conversation and so she like I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.159" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">pretty much 100% certainty that her</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.909" end="00:07:18.219" style="s2">journey was genuine and this was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:20.669" style="s2">subtext of an awful lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.219" end="00:07:24.250" style="s2">coverage that the the need that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.669" end="00:07:28.029" style="s2">negative coverage of the red pill was</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.250" end="00:07:29.529" style="s2">people saying well just insinuating it</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.029" end="00:07:31.300" style="s2">wasn&#39;t genuine that it was somehow it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.529" end="00:07:34.569" style="s2">was funded by men&#39;s rights activists and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.300" end="00:07:36.940" style="s2">it was a it was a Trojan horse done by</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.569" end="00:07:38.349" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.940" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">believe that I think it was a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.349" end="00:07:44.529" style="s2">film I think it was a genuine journey</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:45.909" style="s2">and the irony is under a different in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.529" end="00:07:48.339" style="s2">different circumstance she might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.909" end="00:07:51.009" style="s2">looked on as a as a real feminist hero</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.339" end="00:07:54.069" style="s2">she&#39;s a very successful documentary</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.009" end="00:07:55.690" style="s2">filmmaker I think with a lot of bravery</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.069" end="00:07:58.719" style="s2">as well she she talks about she did</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.690" end="00:08:01.210" style="s2">actually lose some some friends when she</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.719" end="00:08:04.629" style="s2">made the film and she I saw recently</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.210" end="00:08:06.789" style="s2">she&#39;s even been outed or by the Prophet</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.629" end="00:08:09.729" style="s2">the Southern Poverty Law Center which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.789" end="00:08:13.000" style="s2">a kind of anti extremist organization in</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.729" end="00:08:15.219" style="s2">America which seems to be an extremist</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.000" end="00:08:18.029" style="s2">organization itself it had to backtrack</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.219" end="00:08:21.699" style="s2">it it outed magical or Nawaz recently as</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.029" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">an extremist and he is an anti extremist</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.699" end="00:08:25.509" style="s2">former Islamist that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:26.710" style="s2">fascinating what can be said in the cult</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.509" end="00:08:27.969" style="s2">from what can&#39;t be said in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.710" end="00:08:30.580" style="s2">and the fact that a documentary like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.969" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">red pill which along along with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.580" end="00:08:35.589" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists in it also had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:39.250" style="s2">lot of feminist scholars in it as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.589" end="00:08:40.630" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to kind of agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.250" end="00:08:43.930" style="s2">everything the men&#39;s rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.630" end="00:08:45.370" style="s2">are saying in it but in terms of a film</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.930" end="00:08:46.490" style="s2">that adds an interesting perspective I</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.370" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">think it&#39;s definite</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.490" end="00:08:49.910" style="s2">it definitely is that that film because</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.650" end="00:08:52.070" style="s2">why it was really interesting to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.910" end="00:08:53.150" style="s2">Cassie yeah just to back to your point</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.070" end="00:08:55.010" style="s2">about what you said that if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.150" end="00:08:55.490" style="s2">really interesting in a different</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.010" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">setting</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.490" end="00:09:00.380" style="s2">she might be held as a feminist hero I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">think that&#39;s true and I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.380" end="00:09:04.520" style="s2">imagine what that setting might be it</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:06.620" style="s2">certainly it certainly seems kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.520" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">impossible now with the way feminism has</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.620" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">moved at least because it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:15.080" style="s2">around it is in extra pick inextricably</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">tied to the same postmodern ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.080" end="00:09:20.210" style="s2">that a lot of activism is tied to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">of critical theory is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:24.920" style="s2">academia is linked up in with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:27.050" style="s2">oppressor oppressed again a name just</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.920" end="00:09:29.330" style="s2">came up we were talking another very</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.050" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">successful woman Clare layman and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.330" end="00:09:33.980" style="s2">created the magazine quill let out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:36.620" style="s2">her kitchen and it&#39;s now one of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.980" end="00:09:39.020" style="s2">of most the biggest media success</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.620" end="00:09:42.140" style="s2">stories of the last couple of years but</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.020" end="00:09:45.260" style="s2">because quill let is very deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.140" end="00:09:47.930" style="s2">anti identity politics and an to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.260" end="00:09:49.880" style="s2">social justice left she is attacked on</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.930" end="00:09:52.010" style="s2">Twitter rather than celebrated as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.880" end="00:09:54.890" style="s2">successful woman the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:57.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter even if you the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.890" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">ideology Trump&#39;s the personal story</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.280" end="00:10:01.970" style="s2">pretty much all the time with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:05.000" style="s2">identity politics left mmm yeah it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.970" end="00:10:07.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s also it&#39;s an impossible</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.000" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">bind and it&#39;s also an interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.460" end="00:10:13.250" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting indication the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:15.890" style="s2">reaction to Clayman and Cassie J it for</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.250" end="00:10:18.590" style="s2">me really points this weirdness that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.890" end="00:10:20.900" style="s2">live in where the the identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.590" end="00:10:24.410" style="s2">left in particular has kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.900" end="00:10:27.740" style="s2">reigns of what&#39;s culturally acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.410" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">and a lot of pop culture power and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.740" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">of media power so they cannot even</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">though they can act as the oppressor</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:36.590" style="s2">they can never admit that their acting</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">is the oppressor because the entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.590" end="00:10:40.430" style="s2">worldview is based and there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">oppressor and oppressed and so when they</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.430" end="00:10:44.450" style="s2">are always on the side of the underdog</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:46.700" style="s2">yeah and so this makes it impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.450" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">them to look inward of themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.700" end="00:10:50.960" style="s2">realize that they now have the power or</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">a lot of power</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.960" end="00:10:55.190" style="s2">more than perhaps they realize or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:56.750" style="s2">not realize but want to realize and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.190" end="00:11:00.470" style="s2">they&#39;re not using it responsibly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.750" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">this is this the story of the last few</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.470" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">years for me I think if you see it</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.080" style="s2">echoed everywhere and you see it echoed</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.670" style="s2">in the gender discussion as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.080" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">so let&#39;s just hear a quick clip from</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.670" end="00:11:12.230" style="s2">that interview with Cassie I know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:17.180" style="s2">it helps a lot of people making this</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.230" end="00:11:19.160" style="s2">film and and but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.180" end="00:11:21.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere near where we</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">need to be and I think the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.230" end="00:11:25.670" style="s2">movie was just a very early kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">icebreaker into these conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.670" end="00:11:30.380" style="s2">I think we have a long way to go with</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:32.990" style="s2">gender relations and and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.380" end="00:11:35.330" style="s2">eventually finding a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.990" end="00:11:36.710" style="s2">relationship between the genders and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.330" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">other interview that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.710" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">excited about putting out is with Warren</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:44.840" style="s2">Farrell and we&#39;ve talked before about</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.930" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">how if you see culture as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.840" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">fractal pattern then the the fractal</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.280" style="s2">pattern or the patterns that we saw</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:54.710" style="s2">during the late 60s are still here but</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.280" end="00:11:56.450" style="s2">they&#39;ve just got bigger and the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.710" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">gender dynamics that first erupted in</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.450" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">the 60s the rise of women&#39;s liberation</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:12:06.260" style="s2">and feminism and this this now to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">feels like we&#39;re in the same dynamic but</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.260" end="00:12:08.840" style="s2">we look back and we kind of looked</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:12.350" style="s2">through the wrong end of the telescope</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.840" end="00:12:14.660" style="s2">we assumed that everyone back in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.350" end="00:12:16.340" style="s2">was part of this movement but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.660" end="00:12:19.670" style="s2">that it that we know about it shows that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.340" end="00:12:22.490" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t universal it was it was an</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.670" end="00:12:25.610" style="s2">outlier it was a new thing it was we</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.490" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">were always attuned to the new and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.610" end="00:12:29.420" style="s2">some interesting about Warren Farrell is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:32.230" style="s2">that he has been living this dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.420" end="00:12:35.690" style="s2">this same dynamic since the 60s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.230" end="00:12:37.400" style="s2">fascinating individual story because he</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.690" end="00:12:38.900" style="s2">was one of the very first male feminists</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.400" end="00:12:40.520" style="s2">he was part of the he was on the board</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.900" end="00:12:45.080" style="s2">of the National Organization for Women</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.520" end="00:12:47.780" style="s2">in America and he he then at the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.080" end="00:12:49.250" style="s2">time started leading men&#39;s groups and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.780" end="00:12:50.930" style="s2">the men&#39;s groups he was hearing stories</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.250" end="00:12:53.090" style="s2">that he realized were not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.930" end="00:12:54.770" style="s2">conversation and when he started</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.090" end="00:12:56.510" style="s2">bringing the experience of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.770" end="00:12:58.700" style="s2">men have been hurt and the way that men</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.510" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">feel that they have to perform certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.700" end="00:13:02.960" style="s2">gender roles and that they are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:04.860" style="s2">success he uses the words for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.960" end="00:13:07.170" style="s2">that yes women</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.860" end="00:13:09.450" style="s2">women are often objectified and seen as</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.170" end="00:13:11.930" style="s2">sex objects and judged by their looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.450" end="00:13:14.910" style="s2">men feel that they&#39;re often judged by</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.930" end="00:13:16.140" style="s2">success he calls success objects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.910" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">judged by their ability to provide</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.140" end="00:13:21.210" style="s2">they&#39;re judged by their wealth they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:25.530" style="s2">judged by their status there was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.210" end="00:13:26.940" style="s2">beautiful moment I really I know that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.530" end="00:13:28.500" style="s2">both really enjoyed meeting him and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.940" end="00:13:29.940" style="s2">spending time with him there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.500" end="00:13:31.950" style="s2">beautiful moment towards the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.940" end="00:13:35.220" style="s2">interview where he said men have makeup</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.950" end="00:13:37.020" style="s2">to male makeup is I am dr. Warren</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.220" end="00:13:40.940" style="s2">Farrell best-selling author of the boy</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.020" end="00:13:43.710" style="s2">crisis and what&#39;s my makeup I&#39;m doctor</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.940" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">best-selling author</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.710" end="00:13:49.340" style="s2">that&#39;s all makeup it&#39;s me being afraid</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:51.630" style="s2">of saying I&#39;m also Warren Farrell</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.340" end="00:13:54.090" style="s2">vulnerable human being in these five or</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.630" end="00:13:56.400" style="s2">six ways considering he&#39;s often framed</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.090" end="00:13:58.140" style="s2">as the father of the men&#39;s movement and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.400" end="00:14:01.650" style="s2">the men&#39;s movement especially in America</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.140" end="00:14:03.510" style="s2">has a really bad reputation and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.650" end="00:14:05.640" style="s2">quite rightly I mean I asked him that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.510" end="00:14:07.110" style="s2">the interview whether he agreed that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.640" end="00:14:08.730" style="s2">some of the bad press at the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.110" end="00:14:11.670" style="s2">movement had was deserved and he agreed</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.730" end="00:14:13.170" style="s2">that it was and I think certainly a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.670" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">of the tactics that I see from some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.170" end="00:14:17.580" style="s2">the more extreme men&#39;s rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.040" style="s2">in America I can see why they have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.580" end="00:14:22.530" style="s2">reputation and it&#39;s not I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.040" end="00:14:24.840" style="s2">it&#39;s doing they&#39;re there cause any good</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.530" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">they they kind of turn into the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.840" end="00:14:30.960" style="s2">that they&#39;re supposedly fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:32.760" style="s2">but as I said at the beginning Warren</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.960" end="00:14:34.950" style="s2">Farrell is someone who&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.760" end="00:14:36.690" style="s2">focused on what the healthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.950" end="00:14:39.150" style="s2">relationships look like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.690" end="00:14:40.980" style="s2">things that need to be expressed from</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.150" end="00:14:43.950" style="s2">men and from women so that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.980" end="00:14:48.560" style="s2">healthy relationships and if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.950" end="00:14:52.710" style="s2">culture where men are on one hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.560" end="00:14:55.140" style="s2">encouraged to express their feelings but</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.710" end="00:14:57.510" style="s2">also on the other hand often the culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.140" end="00:14:59.400" style="s2">will describe it as whining when then do</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.510" end="00:15:02.310" style="s2">express their feelings there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.400" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">double bind and a lot of men feel stuck</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.310" end="00:15:07.260" style="s2">in that in the moment yeah what really</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:08.790" style="s2">struck me about Warren Farrell aside</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.260" end="00:15:13.290" style="s2">from him is an individual that I found</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.790" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very authentic is his his focus in</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.290" end="00:15:15.960" style="s2">in the myth of male power his first kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.200" style="s2">of best selling</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.960" end="00:15:21.899" style="s2">book it&#39;s very nuanced and it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.200" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">balanced perspective of going into the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.899" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">economics and that also dictated the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:29.190" style="s2">relationship structures we had for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:31.050" style="s2">very long time</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.190" end="00:15:33.540" style="s2">and pointing out that it&#39;s not as simple</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.050" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">as just saying men were patriarchs and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.540" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">they held women down and just because</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:39.390" style="s2">you know because they&#39;re dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:41.730" style="s2">in some way it was it was a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.390" end="00:15:44.760" style="s2">complex than that and yes some of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:46.589" style="s2">went on of course but it was also a case</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.760" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">of men had to go out and be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.589" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">breadwinners men were expendable as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:55.529" style="s2">and then we shifted in the 60s and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.820" style="s2">slightly before to different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.529" end="00:15:58.770" style="s2">relationship for the first time ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.820" end="00:16:00.390" style="s2">happening so this is all very new the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.770" end="00:16:04.290" style="s2">dynamics are experiencing all really</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.390" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">fresh like yeah and so and now we said</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.290" end="00:16:09.300" style="s2">in the interview really nice thing which</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">was around like we&#39;re not designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.300" end="00:16:11.880" style="s2">functional</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:13.050" style="s2">we&#39;re design in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.880" end="00:16:14.610" style="s2">relationships how we relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.050" end="00:16:15.750" style="s2">other&#39;s men and women like which is time</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.610" end="00:16:17.520" style="s2">to be dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.750" end="00:16:20.070" style="s2">we&#39;re designed to survive basically what</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.520" end="00:16:23.400" style="s2">he says and that you know so we have he</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.070" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">says we have an opportunity now where we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.400" end="00:16:28.620" style="s2">have a lot more equality to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:31.080" style="s2">how do we how the hell do we get on with</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.620" end="00:16:32.430" style="s2">each other in a in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.080" end="00:16:34.589" style="s2">conducive to our health and our</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:36.300" style="s2">children&#39;s health as well and I found</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.589" end="00:16:38.310" style="s2">that was the overriding message I got</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.300" end="00:16:41.520" style="s2">from him I think is in his work as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.310" end="00:16:43.830" style="s2">is it&#39;s really about I find that really</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.520" end="00:16:44.790" style="s2">useful framing that globally and I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.830" end="00:16:47.490" style="s2">we might have talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.790" end="00:16:49.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing is the result of an</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.490" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">incredibly dysfunctional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.410" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like the gender dynamics we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:56.790" style="s2">seeing on the macro scale feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:16:59.310" style="s2">micro scale would be like two parents</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.790" end="00:17:00.930" style="s2">having a massive argument more like two</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.310" end="00:17:02.820" style="s2">teenagers having a massive argument I</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.930" end="00:17:04.260" style="s2">think there&#39;s a second part to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.820" end="00:17:06.209" style="s2">interview with Warren Farrell which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.260" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">going to be a patreon exclusive so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.209" end="00:17:11.699" style="s2">you want to see that become a patron I</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:14.189" style="s2">hope that we are now at a stage where</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.699" end="00:17:17.220" style="s2">all sides of that debate can be heard</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.189" end="00:17:19.709" style="s2">because the eruption of Me 2 which was</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.220" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">October last year it were it was said</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.709" end="00:17:25.350" style="s2">quite explicitly at times men now is now</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">is not your time to speak and I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.350" end="00:17:29.490" style="s2">understand that because these are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:33.630" style="s2">of the time or voices that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.490" end="00:17:36.330" style="s2">heard for a long time and but that it</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.630" end="00:17:39.030" style="s2">cannot remain that cannot remain as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.330" end="00:17:44.100" style="s2">dynamic by definition a relationship has</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.030" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">to be both sides speaking and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.100" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">healthy relationship is where both sides</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:50.510" style="s2">are allowed to speak and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:53.490" style="s2">healthy cultural dynamic is when</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.510" end="00:17:55.500" style="s2">something like the red pill is made it</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.490" end="00:17:57.630" style="s2">is not immediately shut down is it not</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.500" end="00:17:59.790" style="s2">immediately criticized as I think vice</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.630" end="00:18:02.130" style="s2">called it you men&#39;s men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.790" end="00:18:04.429" style="s2">bullshit documentary another thing just</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">came up for me that that he said</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.429" end="00:18:10.800" style="s2">relating to the kind of that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:13.530" style="s2">necessary outburst that happens after me</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.800" end="00:18:15.809" style="s2">to was you know procedure therapist who</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.530" end="00:18:17.940" style="s2">said obviously the longer someone&#39;s held</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.809" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">something in the more it comes the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.940" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">anger is behind it when it finally comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:24.420" style="s2">out and now I think was that was very</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:27.420" style="s2">evident there and that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.420" end="00:18:29.850" style="s2">and I wonder now I see that anger as</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.420" end="00:18:31.559" style="s2">well in the men&#39;s rights movement as</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.850" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">well and I understand why it&#39;s there too</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.559" end="00:18:36.900" style="s2">I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">but the what the next stage looks like</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.900" end="00:18:43.559" style="s2">for me is a kind of a meeting where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:44.910" style="s2">anger has extinguished itself somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.559" end="00:18:47.970" style="s2">and maybe we&#39;re getting to that point</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.910" end="00:18:49.770" style="s2">but where the conversation comes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.970" end="00:18:51.570" style="s2">conversation about responsibility I</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.770" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">think ultimately it&#39;s a conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.570" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">both sides around what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:59.160" style="s2">be responsible for yourself and your</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:00.660" style="s2">actions as a human being</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.160" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">whether you&#39;re a man or woman that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.660" end="00:19:03.270" style="s2">what you do in couple you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:05.429" style="s2">couples counseling you talk from the eye</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.270" end="00:19:08.280" style="s2">you talk about yourself you talk about</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.280" end="00:19:13.140" style="s2">made a really good point where he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.660" end="00:19:15.090" style="s2">having a dynamic like feminism has at</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.140" end="00:19:16.860" style="s2">the moment where everything is men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.090" end="00:19:18.929" style="s2">fault I&#39;m being broad with families and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.860" end="00:19:20.970" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about maybe the the worst</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.929" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">sides of it where everything is men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.970" end="00:19:23.480" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:25.500" style="s2">he equates it to a man going to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.480" end="00:19:28.140" style="s2">psychiatrist and sitting down I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.500" end="00:19:29.820" style="s2">like right okay well I&#39;m here but what</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.140" end="00:19:30.510" style="s2">you need to know is that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.820" end="00:19:32.790" style="s2">my wife&#39;s fault</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.510" end="00:19:35.010" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m Peter is because of her</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.790" end="00:19:36.450" style="s2">and I&#39;ve listed out 14 points around</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.010" end="00:19:37.950" style="s2">where she&#39;s a total fuck out and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.450" end="00:19:39.090" style="s2">gonna list them out to you and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.950" end="00:19:39.490" style="s2">better agree with me otherwise I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.090" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.490" end="00:19:43.390" style="s2">the therapist selection and a similar</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:46.330" style="s2">impossible dynamic where nothing can</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.390" end="00:19:49.090" style="s2">happen that I still feel is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.330" end="00:19:50.500" style="s2">kind of largely in and that&#39;s why people</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.090" end="00:19:52.210" style="s2">are allowed to talk at university that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.500" end="00:19:54.520" style="s2">why Cassie is still as of like today</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.210" end="00:19:55.380" style="s2">getting slammed in the press and why</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.520" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2">there&#39;s just a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.380" end="00:20:00.760" style="s2">mischaracterization all around the place</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:04.679" style="s2">and I think something has to give some</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.760" end="00:20:06.940" style="s2">kind of humility or humanity has to give</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.679" end="00:20:09.490" style="s2">in order for that conversation start</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.940" end="00:20:12.210" style="s2">happening and on that point it might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.490" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">a good time to talk about Hannah&#39;s film</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.210" end="00:20:18.250" style="s2">yeah so this is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.250" end="00:20:23.290" style="s2">experimental thing that we&#39;ve done Hanna</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:25.990" style="s2">produced this film which has gone pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.290" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">viral on online called from women to men</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.990" end="00:20:30.830" style="s2">I am a woman</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.830" end="00:20:39.710" style="s2">who has been hurt by men I&#39;m a woman who</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:42.020" style="s2">has hurt men who has hurt men and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.710" end="00:20:44.600" style="s2">a she&#39;s a conflict negotiator that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.020" end="00:20:45.650" style="s2">what she did for many years in some of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.600" end="00:20:48.770" style="s2">the world so the most intractable</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.650" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">conflict and the thing that she realized</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.770" end="00:20:54.440" style="s2">is that we cannot move forward until you</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:56.510" style="s2">own our part of whatever dynamic we</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.440" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">can&#39;t move forward in any in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.510" end="00:21:02.750" style="s2">conflict until we own our side and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:05.300" style="s2">own the stuff that we&#39;ve done and she</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.750" end="00:21:07.270" style="s2">then went through a process of sending</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.300" end="00:21:10.250" style="s2">this poem out to many other women and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.270" end="00:21:12.950" style="s2">they then came together to make the film</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.250" end="00:21:14.870" style="s2">and a lot of them would then choose the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.950" end="00:21:16.580" style="s2">bits of the poem that really spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.870" end="00:21:18.560" style="s2">them the things that they&#39;d done in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.580" end="00:21:19.970" style="s2">past and a lot of them said they went</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.560" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">through a real process through doing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.970" end="00:21:25.460" style="s2">as well there&#39;s a really controversial</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:26.810" style="s2">piece it&#39;s it had really polarized</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.460" end="00:21:28.820" style="s2">reaction online but it&#39;s had about a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.810" end="00:21:31.490" style="s2">million views altogether and I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.820" end="00:21:32.980" style="s2">lot of especially men from some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.490" end="00:21:35.930" style="s2">the men&#39;s groups that I&#39;ve seen online</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.980" end="00:21:40.160" style="s2">very touched by it a lot of people said</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.930" end="00:21:43.430" style="s2">it brought them to tears I do mean over</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.160" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">time when we all take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.430" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">the part each of us plays in this battle</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.980" end="00:21:53.030" style="s2">when we can truly empower ourselves by</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.790" end="00:21:55.910" style="s2">owning our parts of the mess and bring</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.030" end="00:22:01.700" style="s2">an end to the cycle of hurting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.910" end="00:22:06.140" style="s2">blaming I begin today I begin today I</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.700" end="00:22:07.850" style="s2">begin today I begin today you got a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.140" end="00:22:10.850" style="s2">couple of films off the back of that one</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.850" end="00:22:12.830" style="s2">of which is an interview with Hannah and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.850" end="00:22:16.520" style="s2">a couple of the other women who appeared</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.830" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">in the film asking why why they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.520" end="00:22:20.180" style="s2">involved in the project in the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.740" style="s2">place what they got from it and what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.180" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">reaction was whether they have any</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.740" end="00:22:29.900" style="s2">regrets and another film which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.450" end="00:22:32.270" style="s2">slightly more experimental which is and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.900" end="00:22:33.800" style="s2">as Hannah said in her in her film what</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.270" end="00:22:35.690" style="s2">she wanted was to start a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.800" end="00:22:40.070" style="s2">conversation between women women and men</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.690" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">and so we try and model that with Hannah</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.070" end="00:22:44.030" style="s2">her friend Elaine who appears in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:47.420" style="s2">film myself and Rath</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.030" end="00:22:48.890" style="s2">who is a facilitator a therapist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.420" end="00:22:51.770" style="s2">been working for about 40 years with</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.890" end="00:22:54.290" style="s2">these issues the male and the female so</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.770" end="00:22:56.330" style="s2">basically this is an attempt to model</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.290" end="00:22:57.740" style="s2">this kind of conversation what does a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:23:00.620" style="s2">healthy conversation between men and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.740" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">women look like which involves us taking</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.620" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">ownership of our staff and then meeting</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:08.360" style="s2">from a place of real ownership and real</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:11.570" style="s2">communication and we&#39;ll see if that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.360" end="00:23:14.180" style="s2">works yeah well hopefully it kind of has</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.570" end="00:23:15.830" style="s2">to work I think at some point globally</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.180" end="00:23:18.830" style="s2">that kind of conversation has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.830" end="00:23:19.970" style="s2">norm and in fact again to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.830" end="00:23:20.870" style="s2">to Warren Farrell opus it was a long</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.970" end="00:23:22.850" style="s2">interview and he said lots of</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.870" end="00:23:24.650" style="s2">interesting things they&#39;re doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.850" end="00:23:27.530" style="s2">Denmark they&#39;re having their teaching</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.650" end="00:23:29.330" style="s2">children these types of conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.530" end="00:23:31.660" style="s2">that seems the natural thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.330" end="00:23:34.910" style="s2">this is a skill that people need to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:37.670" style="s2">is to be able to and I think personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.910" end="00:23:40.670" style="s2">responsibility is the beginning of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.670" end="00:23:42.260" style="s2">and I think what&#39;s really powerful about</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.670" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">Hannah&#39;s film or just powerful about</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.260" end="00:23:45.230" style="s2">just the idea of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:47.420" style="s2">conversation is that it starts with</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.230" end="00:23:49.640" style="s2">personal responsibility and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.420" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">that seems to be what the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.640" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">crying out for at the moment is this</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:54.940" style="s2">kind of a reconnection to personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:56.840" style="s2">responsibility and a movement away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.940" end="00:23:58.610" style="s2">everything&#39;s about being oppressed or</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.840" end="00:24:02.270" style="s2">being an oppressor and either being a</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.610" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">victim or a perpetrator it&#39;s the yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.270" end="00:24:07.430" style="s2">seems to me like it that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:10.910" style="s2">can&#39;t really happen within that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.430" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">environment within an environment based</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.910" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">on a press or oppressed I think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:17.540" style="s2">just has to go like the broken green</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:18.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve called it it had it&#39;s not a place</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.540" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">for that conversation to happen that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.950" end="00:24:25.670" style="s2">conversation needs to happen in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:28.720" style="s2">kind of new less ideological or post</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.670" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">ideological space which hopefully is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.720" end="00:24:33.620" style="s2">rising up somewhere or in the ether</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">somewhere at the moment yeah I also want</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.620" end="00:24:36.800" style="s2">to say about Hannah&#39;s Vil that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.270" end="00:24:38.690" style="s2">very different reactions to it at</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.800" end="00:24:40.310" style="s2">different times when I first heard it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.690" end="00:24:42.620" style="s2">when she delivered it as a poem in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.310" end="00:24:45.020" style="s2">therapeutic training I was really</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.620" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">touched and it was it was a really</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.020" end="00:24:48.920" style="s2">powerful ownership and then when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:50.840" style="s2">seen it since and I&#39;ve seen the film</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.920" end="00:24:53.210" style="s2">sometimes I watched it and I just</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.840" end="00:24:55.190" style="s2">thought wow this is just it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.210" end="00:24:57.049" style="s2">countercultural it almost feels too much</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.190" end="00:25:00.289" style="s2">because on its own it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.049" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">balance it&#39;s like well okay but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.289" end="00:25:04.580" style="s2">kind of the point is that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">like a little bomb in that inside that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.580" end="00:25:08.860" style="s2">ideology because it&#39;s so anti the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.100" end="00:25:14.299" style="s2">narrative that we live with all the time</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.860" end="00:25:19.759" style="s2">for women to pretty much just own their</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.299" end="00:25:21.619" style="s2">their stuff without any kind of context</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.759" end="00:25:24.440" style="s2">or balancing of men owning their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.619" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">at the same time so it feels you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.440" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:28.429" style="s2">on its own it feels slightly unbalanced</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:30.499" style="s2">but I guess that&#39;s the essence of great</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.429" end="00:25:32.419" style="s2">art in a way great art is not meant to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.499" end="00:25:33.739" style="s2">make you feel comfortable it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.419" end="00:25:35.570" style="s2">supposed to make you feel uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.739" end="00:25:37.489" style="s2">and even I have felt uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.570" end="00:25:42.409" style="s2">watching that film every now and again</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.489" end="00:25:43.820" style="s2">and yeah I hope that in the recording</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.409" end="00:25:46.730" style="s2">that we&#39;ve put together with raffia</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.820" end="00:25:48.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain balance in terms of us</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.730" end="00:25:50.809" style="s2">owning our stuff and then building more</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.889" end="00:25:52.639" style="s2">of a complete conversation around it as</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.809" end="00:25:55.249" style="s2">well as you were as you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.639" end="00:25:58.369" style="s2">that that I know that feeling I call it</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.249" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">like vicarious discomfort it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.369" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">sense of how something will land in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.909" style="s2">culture and I feel like some part of me</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:07.070" style="s2">which of course were tribal pea beings</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.909" end="00:26:08.749" style="s2">now even if even there&#39;s a lot within</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.070" end="00:26:11.480" style="s2">the culture below I disagree with I</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.749" end="00:26:12.739" style="s2">still feel that twins I&#39;ve again had a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.480" end="00:26:13.909" style="s2">similar experience watching Hannah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.739" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">film I think the first time it was</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.909" end="00:26:18.049" style="s2">incredibly emotional you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:20.450" style="s2">real - really but a real heartfelt</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.049" end="00:26:23.960" style="s2">feeling of like relief of like wow okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.450" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">that feels really just very loving and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.960" end="00:26:29.119" style="s2">very responsible like really a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:32.179" style="s2">powerful loving feminine energy that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.119" end="00:26:33.619" style="s2">comes with that but also that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.179" end="00:26:34.759" style="s2">like wow this is gonna be dynamite</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.619" end="00:26:35.929" style="s2">remember that was the that was what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.759" end="00:26:37.940" style="s2">thought first time so I was like wow</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.929" end="00:26:40.820" style="s2">this is gonna this is definitely gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.940" end="00:26:43.909" style="s2">ruffle some feathers which it has yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.820" end="00:26:46.039" style="s2">yeah but again feather ruffling is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.909" end="00:26:49.639" style="s2">the point of art I think the point of</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.039" end="00:26:51.619" style="s2">good art and that&#39;s what leads to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.639" end="00:26:53.239" style="s2">growth I think it&#39;s worth also saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.619" end="00:26:56.119" style="s2">that our interest in these subjects it</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.239" end="00:26:58.489" style="s2">probably comes from our own histories in</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.119" end="00:27:00.169" style="s2">terms of a lot of the the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.489" end="00:27:04.179" style="s2">inner work that we&#39;ve done around</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.169" end="00:27:07.700" style="s2">masculinity we both teach men&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.179" end="00:27:10.520" style="s2">ultimately these questions can only be</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.700" end="00:27:13.460" style="s2">resolved really an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.520" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">it it cannot just become a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.460" end="00:27:17.300" style="s2">about masculinity and femininity because</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:19.400" style="s2">then you get into this kind of swampy</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.300" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">relativistic suit of or what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.400" end="00:27:22.730" style="s2">by masculine what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:24.650" style="s2">feminine surely we&#39;re just humans and</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.730" end="00:27:27.470" style="s2">then it it all starts to kind of become</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.650" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">very relativistic very quickly whereas I</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.470" end="00:27:34.070" style="s2">know that my experience of doing work or</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:36.140" style="s2">a really connect with myself in my</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.070" end="00:27:37.460" style="s2">masculine that there&#39;s a real embodied</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.140" end="00:27:38.930" style="s2">presence that I can bring to these</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.460" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">questions and then a lot of these kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.930" end="00:27:45.860" style="s2">of gender dynamics resolve themselves</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">very very quickly and if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.860" end="00:27:49.010" style="s2">this new you&#39;re interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.330" style="s2">subject we are teaching we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.010" end="00:27:52.400" style="s2">men&#39;s workshop coming up in November</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.330" end="00:27:54.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a women&#39;s workshop coming up</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.400" end="00:27:57.110" style="s2">in September at the end of September</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.470" end="00:27:59.000" style="s2">that is being taught by some amazing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.110" end="00:28:02.180" style="s2">facilitators including Hannah actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.000" end="00:28:04.130" style="s2">who did the film and we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.180" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">polarity workshop coming up in January</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.130" end="00:28:09.530" style="s2">as well I think it&#39;s so important to tie</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:12.020" style="s2">this this content the ideas together</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.530" end="00:28:13.610" style="s2">with the embodied work because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.020" end="00:28:15.170" style="s2">if we just stay up in the heads we just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.610" end="00:28:17.270" style="s2">stay up in the conceptual realm and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.170" end="00:28:19.550" style="s2">nothing gets resolved I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.270" end="00:28:22.100" style="s2">important to add none of the workshops</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.550" end="00:28:24.530" style="s2">about telling anyone what masculinity or</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.100" end="00:28:27.820" style="s2">femininity is it&#39;s really because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.530" end="00:28:30.830" style="s2">can&#39;t you each individual has to connect</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.820" end="00:28:33.470" style="s2">to what that is experientially within</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.830" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">themselves and a space like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.470" end="00:28:38.270" style="s2">it&#39;s a flow state it&#39;s getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:41.300" style="s2">flow state and in a flow state the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.270" end="00:28:43.340" style="s2">concepts the ideas they are of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.300" end="00:28:46.250" style="s2">they&#39;re not important at all in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.340" end="00:28:48.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the experience and so experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.250" end="00:28:50.870" style="s2">again is also what really like meeting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.920" end="00:28:54.170" style="s2">human to human and communicating human</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.870" end="00:28:56.750" style="s2">to human that&#39;s also absolutely key in</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.170" end="00:28:59.390" style="s2">developing our own ideas but then also</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.750" end="00:29:00.680" style="s2">developing ideas collectively and on</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.390" end="00:29:03.350" style="s2">that now we also have another event</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.680" end="00:29:05.900" style="s2">coming up which is join the great</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">intellectual awakening and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.900" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">to be on the 18th of September in London</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:14.590" style="s2">notes down in the show notes with a link</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.280" end="00:29:17.110" style="s2">to it but again that event it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.590" end="00:29:19.510" style="s2">us talking about what&#39;s that&#39;s run it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.110" end="00:29:21.340" style="s2">this is pretty much us trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.510" end="00:29:24.040" style="s2">that we&#39;ve always wanted to create a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.340" end="00:29:25.690" style="s2">community around these ideas and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.040" end="00:29:28.360" style="s2">our first event to try and create that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.690" end="00:29:30.100" style="s2">kind of community so we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.360" end="00:29:31.570" style="s2">about rebel wisdoms were gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.100" end="00:29:33.610" style="s2">about a history and show some of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.570" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">clips from some of the films and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.610" end="00:29:37.900" style="s2">trying to create some kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:39.820" style="s2">having having these kind of generative</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.900" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">dialogues which we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.820" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">before what does it mean to have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:45.970" style="s2">dialogue where you go in genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:48.250" style="s2">trying from a place of not knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.970" end="00:29:50.530" style="s2">inquiring and and finding the answers</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.250" end="00:29:53.020" style="s2">for yourselves rather than this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.530" end="00:29:54.130" style="s2">very ideological way of trying to kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.020" end="00:29:55.929" style="s2">of persuade someone that you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.130" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">yeah or what Jordan Greene whole talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.929" end="00:30:01.510" style="s2">about like the old broadcast model or</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.179" end="00:30:10.679" style="s2">different paradigm now which is the more</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.970" end="00:30:12.820" style="s2">decentralized kind of knowledge sharing</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.679" end="00:30:14.650" style="s2">18th of September if you&#39;re in London</p>
