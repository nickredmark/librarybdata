<p begin="00:02:30.819" end="00:02:36.709" style="s2">ideally we need to get to a state where</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.769" end="00:02:39.940" style="s2">we become aware of the fact that this</p>

<p begin="00:02:52.010" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">do that we need to find a way of living</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.720" end="00:02:59.090" style="s2">where we don&#39;t not claiming ownership</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:03:01.549" style="s2">over the entire planet so basically we</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.090" end="00:03:03.560" style="s2">need to give it back so we need to give</p>

<p begin="00:03:11.299" end="00:03:16.750" style="s2">but yeah of the natural world to nature</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.150" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">we&#39;d have no space for ourselves to live</p>

<p begin="00:03:21.900" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">I&#39;m proposing that we build huge</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:26.690" style="s2">reefer madness like land owners owning</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">though it was inferior products so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.970" end="00:16:36.890" style="s2">came up with inferior paper made hemp</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">illegal because paper used to be made</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.890" end="00:16:41.029" style="s2">from hemp clothes used to be made from</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:42.709" style="s2">him the British Empire was built on him</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.450" end="00:16:56.150" style="s2">so at some point hemp built the British</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.150" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">turned its back on him and made it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.640" end="00:17:04.760" style="s2">illegal but that illegality has led to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:06.350" style="s2">all sorts of crimes and it would be a</p>
