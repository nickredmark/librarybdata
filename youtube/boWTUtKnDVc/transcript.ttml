<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:26.099" style="s2">hang we have questions overflowing our</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.099" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">to address as many of them as possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.980" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start with two questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">from Twitter which I promised to do the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">first question by the way how does</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">printing suck so badly it&#39;s 20/20 why</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">can the printer not figure out what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">wanted to do it&#39;s a mystery</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.190" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">alright first what if we want the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">printer to have that much access to your</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">brain I just wanted to behave and I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:54.840" style="s2">it not to behave badly when it knows I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">on deadline why does it always screw up</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.840" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">yeah all right Benjamin asks begins with</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">Thanks could you both give a simple</p>

<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:21.810" style="s2">a great question it deserves a 15 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.890" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">minute tutorial at some point but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.810" end="00:01:30.470" style="s2">just say for the moment that the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">basics are the same as for any other</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.470" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">hypothesis driven science the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">difference is biology is complex and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">therefore sometimes the standards have</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">to be different it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">falsify a true biological idea with two</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:45.689" style="s2">highest standard in other words to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.590" style="s2">accept some sort of noise as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.689" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">falsification but other than that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.590" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">hypotheses lead to predictions and those</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:57.509" style="s2">predictions are what tells you whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">or not this is valid and so what I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.509" end="00:02:03.810" style="s2">say is when hypotheses are offered ask</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:05.450" style="s2">what the predictions are now it may take</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.810" end="00:02:08.060" style="s2">some time this there&#39;s kind of an art to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.450" end="00:02:11.420" style="s2">generating predictions it&#39;s not simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.060" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2">one gets better at it with practice but</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.420" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">the hypothesis and the predictions are a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.460" end="00:02:20.360" style="s2">package and to the extent that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2">predictions are either pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.360" end="00:02:24.170" style="s2">certain to be true they&#39;re not very high</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:26.810" style="s2">quality to the extent that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.170" end="00:02:29.240" style="s2">surprising counterintuitive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.810" end="00:02:31.070" style="s2">definitely outside the range of what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.240" end="00:02:33.530" style="s2">person offering the hypothesis would</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.070" end="00:02:37.150" style="s2">have reason to know then they are high</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.530" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">quality and so anyway I would just say</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.150" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">hypothetically code adducted method is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">philosophically well understood it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:50.420" style="s2">different in biology and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:51.830" style="s2">do you know how it works and can you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.420" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">apply it and it will prevent you from</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.830" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">overfitting in fact it will correct when</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:02:57.130" style="s2">you have engaged in overfitting it will</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">tell you what you don&#39;t want to know</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.130" end="00:03:02.300" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s that good a method so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:05.390" style="s2">this definitely warrants several</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.300" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">separate conversations and this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.390" end="00:03:08.900" style="s2">exactly an answer to the question of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:10.700" style="s2">simple tutorial for how to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.900" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">but I will say that I used to begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.700" end="00:03:15.290" style="s2">every single one of my programs at</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">Evergreen with an exercise that I had</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.290" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">modified from one that the organization</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:21.049" style="s2">for tropical studies did with students</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">when they were learning how to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.049" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">tropical biologists in Costa Rica and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:29.560" style="s2">Panama and involved taking all of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:32.540" style="s2">students out somewhere out of sight of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">everyone else and just dropping them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.540" end="00:03:37.100" style="s2">there for two hours with a pen and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">notebook and hopefully nothing else and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.100" end="00:03:44.180" style="s2">saying be still use your senses watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:46.120" style="s2">your brain tell you it&#39;s Borden that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.180" end="00:03:49.610" style="s2">it&#39;s screaming and you need to leave and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.120" end="00:03:50.870" style="s2">once that slows down start observing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.610" end="00:03:52.340" style="s2">those things that are happening outside</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.870" end="00:03:54.049" style="s2">of your brain and write down the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.340" end="00:03:56.150" style="s2">questions that occur to you that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.049" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">first half and then in the second half</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.150" end="00:03:59.600" style="s2">everyone comes back together better if</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:03.350" style="s2">it&#39;s the next day so now I&#39;m just in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.600" end="00:04:05.150" style="s2">afternoon of the same day and in small</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.350" end="00:04:08.989" style="s2">groups looks at everyone&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.150" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">everyone writes down maybe their two</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.989" end="00:04:11.570" style="s2">favorite questions and the two favorite</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.340" end="00:04:13.340" style="s2">questions of the person sitting next to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.570" end="00:04:16.220" style="s2">them and then as a group they try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.340" end="00:04:17.989" style="s2">figure out the hypotheses that might</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.220" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">address the questions and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.989" end="00:04:21.220" style="s2">predictions that follow from they saw</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:23.740" style="s2">those hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.220" end="00:04:26.140" style="s2">then in an all group melee and all group</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:28.420" style="s2">and all class free-for-all we all</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.140" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">discuss a few of these hypotheses that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.420" end="00:04:33.670" style="s2">were generated from each of the small</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:35.320" style="s2">groups and it is amazing to see not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.670" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">what kinds of observations people make</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.320" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">but what kinds of hypotheses they</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">generated for those observations and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">what predictions would inherently follow</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:46.450" style="s2">from this hypotheses but also how</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">dedicated people can&#39;t become two</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.450" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2">hypotheses that they have generated less</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">than 24 hours before and now are willing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">to fiercely defend it seems with almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:59.140" style="s2">with their lives and so it is a lesson</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">not only in how to do science</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.140" end="00:05:03.190" style="s2">specifically field science in this case</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:05.950" style="s2">but science in general but also in how</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.190" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">quickly human psychology can twist</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.950" end="00:05:10.570" style="s2">itself around to defend things that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:12.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know existed mere moments an</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.570" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">evolutionary timescale before yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.910" end="00:05:17.650" style="s2">an important topic and separating a</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.830" end="00:06:21.880" style="s2">more wired for metaphor etc yes first of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.270" end="00:06:22.840" style="s2">all I would say we are damned if we do</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.840" end="00:06:29.130" style="s2">and I would advise people actually take</p>

<p begin="00:11:39.660" end="00:11:45.150" style="s2">believe we can say with certainty is</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.090" end="00:11:47.850" style="s2">that you cannot be certain of the origin</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.150" end="00:11:49.710" style="s2">of this virus nobody who is telling you</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.850" end="00:11:50.850" style="s2">that it couldn&#39;t have come from a lab is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.710" end="00:11:53.490" style="s2">telling you the truth</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.850" end="00:11:55.740" style="s2">because that cannot be certain based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:58.140" style="s2">what we currently see I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.740" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">the case if it is not the case I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.140" end="00:12:01.890" style="s2">be pleased to discover it and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:03.330" style="s2">personally embarrassing for me to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.890" end="00:12:06.240" style="s2">to admit it but I will be pleased</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.330" end="00:12:07.980" style="s2">because it means we&#39;re far better off</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.240" end="00:12:10.490" style="s2">going forward and I would like us to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.980" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">far better off and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.490" end="00:12:14.550" style="s2">embarrassing</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:16.800" style="s2">maybe but really you&#39;ve been so careful</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.550" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">as both of us aim to be all the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.800" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">about saying this is a hypothesis for</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:24.960" style="s2">which I see more and more evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:27.240" style="s2">you know in this particular case you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.960" end="00:12:30.150" style="s2">really hope it&#39;s not true but that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.240" end="00:12:33.270" style="s2">does not change the the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.150" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">ultimately which is to say if it turns</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.270" end="00:12:36.210" style="s2">out that all the evidence that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.570" style="s2">seeing and that we&#39;re seeing right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.210" end="00:12:42.330" style="s2">turn out to be erroneous or overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.570" end="00:12:45.030" style="s2">by contravening evidence fabulous and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.330" end="00:12:48.180" style="s2">come you know we&#39;ll come and say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.030" end="00:12:49.980" style="s2">and I guess I&#39;m not even sure that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.180" end="00:12:51.990" style="s2">warrants embarrassment it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.980" end="00:12:54.690" style="s2">unfortunate it&#39;d be better would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.990" end="00:12:56.580" style="s2">know it would be an easier life if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.690" end="00:12:58.080" style="s2">were always right if we were if we were</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.580" end="00:13:00.210" style="s2">all always right and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.080" end="00:13:02.870" style="s2">not going to happen yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.210" end="00:13:05.550" style="s2">this this is worth spending a moment on</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.870" end="00:13:07.590" style="s2">it is embarrassing whether it should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.550" end="00:13:11.960" style="s2">or shouldn&#39;t be it is embarrassing</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.590" end="00:13:13.860" style="s2">however it&#39;s a lot like quitting smoking</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.960" end="00:13:17.070" style="s2">right quitting</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.860" end="00:13:18.300" style="s2">is famously difficult but it gets more</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.070" end="00:13:19.890" style="s2">difficult the longer you&#39;ve been smoking</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.300" end="00:13:21.150" style="s2">so the fact that it&#39;s difficult is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.890" end="00:13:23.820" style="s2">an argument against it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.150" end="00:13:25.860" style="s2">in this case being wrong when you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.820" end="00:13:27.540" style="s2">taken a position and you know been</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.860" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">mocked for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.540" end="00:13:30.390" style="s2">discovering that actually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.220" style="s2">something wrong with your position is</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.390" end="00:13:34.530" style="s2">not a pleasant experience but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.220" end="00:13:36.150" style="s2">discovering that earlier is far better</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.530" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">than continuing to double down on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.150" end="00:13:41.160" style="s2">wrong idea and so comparatively speaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:43.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a relief to get to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.160" end="00:13:45.270" style="s2">of that thing and I will face the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.500" end="00:13:47.130" style="s2">embarrassment if that&#39;s what it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.270" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">but so far that has not been the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.130" end="00:13:52.530" style="s2">direction good okay for three Geographic</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:55.800" style="s2">next question for three geographic</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.530" end="00:13:58.020" style="s2">locations a B and C B is closer to a C</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.800" end="00:14:01.200" style="s2">is far away from me so it&#39;s linearly a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.020" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2">next to be next to see would you expect</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.200" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">bat Cove B that is to say from location</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:09.090" style="s2">B to be closer genetically to bat Cove a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:11.100" style="s2">than Back Cove C to back of a assume</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.090" end="00:14:13.530" style="s2">similar bats so I&#39;m gonna just reframe</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.100" end="00:14:14.730" style="s2">that in I think I understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.530" end="00:14:16.230" style="s2">question is and it&#39;s well written it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.730" end="00:14:18.210" style="s2">just hard probably to interpret for</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.230" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">people who are merely hearing it rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.210" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">than reading it if you&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:24.180" style="s2">locations arrayed in a line in which a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.280" style="s2">and C are farthest apart from one</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.180" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">another and B is intermediate would we</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.280" end="00:14:33.510" style="s2">expect I you know all else being equal</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:36.840" style="s2">is is unstated here that a virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.510" end="00:14:42.180" style="s2">emerging from B is more closely related</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.840" end="00:14:46.140" style="s2">to that emerging from a then the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.180" end="00:14:47.970" style="s2">from C is to a that is to say if if</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.140" end="00:14:50.370" style="s2">nothing else is different between these</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.970" end="00:14:53.510" style="s2">these species and the environments and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.370" end="00:14:56.070" style="s2">everything else is physical proximity</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.510" end="00:14:58.860" style="s2">decent proxy for relatedness and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.070" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">but the all else being equal question is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.860" end="00:15:02.730" style="s2">is the big one</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:05.640" style="s2">the all else being equal question is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.730" end="00:15:08.460" style="s2">big one and I hate it when people follow</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.640" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">and all else being equal with the claim</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.460" end="00:15:12.270" style="s2">that all else is never equal because</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:14.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not the point of its inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.270" end="00:15:16.710" style="s2">here but in this case it is especially</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.150" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">unlikely that they are equal so for one</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.710" end="00:15:22.530" style="s2">thing let&#39;s just point to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:25.350" style="s2">you&#39;ve got locations a B and C in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.530" end="00:15:26.950" style="s2">world of airplanes right airplanes</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.350" end="00:15:29.350" style="s2">invalidate the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.950" end="00:15:33.010" style="s2">here as long as those locations are far</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.350" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">enough that people you know can</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.010" end="00:15:36.910" style="s2">transport this virus and it could</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:38.080" style="s2">potentially move back and forth I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.910" end="00:15:39.700" style="s2">guess not I guess I guess if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.080" end="00:15:44.460" style="s2">talking for your bats but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.700" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">other thing so I worked on fruit bats</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.460" end="00:15:48.640" style="s2">there was a species of fruit bat on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:49.090" style="s2">island Barrow Colorado where I was</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.640" end="00:15:51.460" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.090" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">you&#39;re a derma baile bottom and I had an</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.460" end="00:15:56.770" style="s2">argument with my advisor my bat advisor</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">on the island about whether this animal</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.770" end="00:16:00.700" style="s2">ever roost it on the island I turned out</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.980" style="s2">to be right it did but the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.700" end="00:16:05.710" style="s2">he one of the world&#39;s leading experts on</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.980" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">fruit bats did not believe it too was</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.710" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">that it did not live there year-round</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:12.490" style="s2">it&#39;s circulated from one island to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:15.070" style="s2">next and there was a particular season</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.490" end="00:16:17.290" style="s2">in which this animal would fly on to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.070" end="00:16:19.420" style="s2">island and roost because I was studying</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.290" end="00:16:21.280" style="s2">its roosting ecology I detected that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.420" end="00:16:22.930" style="s2">was present and there he was netting</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.280" end="00:16:24.460" style="s2">bats and so he never knew if they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.930" end="00:16:28.360" style="s2">flying onto the island and then going</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.460" end="00:16:30.820" style="s2">home or or what but my point is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.360" end="00:16:35.140" style="s2">physical location of Yura derma was</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.820" end="00:16:37.660" style="s2">actually in motion based on the presence</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.140" end="00:16:39.280" style="s2">or absence of ripe fruit on the island</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.660" end="00:16:41.530" style="s2">and so the physical location if you had</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.280" end="00:16:43.090" style="s2">islands in proximity the fact that some</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.530" end="00:16:45.100" style="s2">creature had flown from one island to</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.090" end="00:16:48.040" style="s2">another and started roosting there would</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.100" end="00:16:49.780" style="s2">not predict to which other population</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.040" end="00:16:53.560" style="s2">its viruses would be most closely</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.780" end="00:16:55.330" style="s2">related so anyway forget my airplane</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.560" end="00:16:58.450" style="s2">analogy obviously with people that works</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.330" end="00:17:00.790" style="s2">with bats it doesn&#39;t but in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.450" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">bats there is an awful lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.790" end="00:17:07.350" style="s2">ecology that would tend to make the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:10.329" style="s2">connection between populations of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.350" end="00:17:13.390" style="s2">viruses inhabiting bats very very noisy</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.329" end="00:17:16.120" style="s2">but as Heather said all else being equal</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.390" end="00:17:17.949" style="s2">in general there will be a closer</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.120" end="00:17:19.900" style="s2">connection between those populations in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.949" end="00:17:23.740" style="s2">close proximity yeah I mean flight</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.900" end="00:17:25.870" style="s2">flight changes everything right so in</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.740" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">general the bio geographic distribution</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.870" end="00:17:32.110" style="s2">of organisms is very different for birds</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:33.580" style="s2">and for bats and for other flying</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.110" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">organisms especially that can fly across</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.580" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">any large body of water then it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:41.860" style="s2">to be for something that had to either</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:43.210" style="s2">draught somewhere or wait for the</p>

<p begin="00:18:04.990" end="00:18:08.950" style="s2">well thank you for that ok recently had</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">most of them so yeah yes I like turtles</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.190" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">I interesting thing about turtles</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">turtles in the Amazon very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:53.490" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:55.740" style="s2">butterflies if the turtles pull out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.490" end="00:19:56.879" style="s2">the water they haul out onto a log and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.740" end="00:20:01.350" style="s2">they sit there in the Sun and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.879" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">butterflies land on their on their heads</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.350" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">and I think collect salt from tears and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:10.470" style="s2">things any way you can if you google it</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:11.970" style="s2">you&#39;ll find dozens of photos of this but</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.470" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">here&#39;s the tragic thing we were just in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.970" end="00:20:18.929" style="s2">the Amazon and we saw in January far</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:21.690" style="s2">fewer butterflies we saw internalist</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.929" end="00:20:24.029" style="s2">Earth of insects but for the turtles we</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.690" end="00:20:25.289" style="s2">saw and given that there were less</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.029" end="00:20:28.169" style="s2">Turtles you might expect that they would</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.289" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">be more set upon by the butterflies but</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.169" end="00:20:32.759" style="s2">there appeared to be far fewer</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:34.590" style="s2">butterflies and this was in a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.759" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">remote location so you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.590" end="00:20:38.610" style="s2">talking about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.139" style="s2">pesticides working their way downstream</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.610" end="00:20:42.330" style="s2">and the water shed or something but</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.139" end="00:20:44.809" style="s2">anyway insectivorous birds are also</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.330" end="00:20:47.460" style="s2">beginning to disappear they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.809" end="00:20:49.350" style="s2">yeah so that that again is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.460" end="00:20:51.539" style="s2">conversation for their time let me just</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.350" end="00:20:53.789" style="s2">say one one upbeat thing about turtles</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.539" end="00:20:56.100" style="s2">which most people don&#39;t know which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.789" end="00:20:58.259" style="s2">that their their carapace and plaster on</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.100" end="00:21:01.499" style="s2">the shell the top and the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.259" end="00:21:03.629" style="s2">shell are actually so rigid that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.499" end="00:21:04.889" style="s2">don&#39;t do a very good job of breathing</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.629" end="00:21:07.740" style="s2">within that so they actually have</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.889" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">accessory lungs in their legs that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.740" end="00:21:15.330" style="s2">true cool I can&#39;t use the said of those</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:16.679" style="s2">it probably would yeah please consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.330" end="00:21:18.360" style="s2">sharing your views on Joe Rogan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.679" end="00:21:20.070" style="s2">podcast you can also have an argument</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.360" end="00:21:21.389" style="s2">lockdown or not with him greetings from</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.070" end="00:21:26.309" style="s2">a Czech Republic and thank you for all</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.389" end="00:21:28.649" style="s2">the content we&#39;d love to UM we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.309" end="00:21:32.220" style="s2">live in LA but I would be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.649" end="00:21:33.869" style="s2">travel for that for sure you say viruses</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.220" end="00:21:35.249" style="s2">evolved to be less deadly since it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.869" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">spreads well among the young and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.249" end="00:21:38.249" style="s2">with little deadliness am i right to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:39.869" style="s2">think that it becomes less deadly at</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.249" end="00:21:43.889" style="s2">half the rate as it would if it had</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.869" end="00:21:46.649" style="s2">uniform deadliness approximately half</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.889" end="00:21:47.970" style="s2">the rate he says I&#39;m not sure even with</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.649" end="00:21:54.419" style="s2">that approximately in front of the half</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.970" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure where that where this comes</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.419" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">from quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.890" end="00:22:04.910" style="s2">Wow I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure I&#39;m just missing a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.020" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">logical step here but I don&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.910" end="00:22:10.550" style="s2">imagine what it would be yeah both of us</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:13.460" style="s2">feel free to rephrase that question and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.550" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">send it to us one way or the other yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.460" end="00:22:18.410" style="s2">sorry about that you said a few podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:20.390" style="s2">ago that herpes and coronavirus might</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.410" end="00:22:21.770" style="s2">interact to cause internal damage can</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.390" end="00:22:24.770" style="s2">you elaborate on this are you talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.770" end="00:22:26.330" style="s2">about HS F 1 or 2 or both and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.770" end="00:22:29.050" style="s2">know about the damage love the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.330" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure we can distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.050" end="00:22:36.260" style="s2">the two both of those are that&#39;s herpes</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:40.670" style="s2">simplex virus 1 &amp; 2 so rather not herpes</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.260" end="00:22:44.840" style="s2">complex we&#39;re talking about simplex only</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.670" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">I think the way it interacts is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.840" end="00:22:53.060" style="s2">virus seems to cross into the central</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:55.880" style="s2">nervous system and these herpes viruses</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.060" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">reside in neurons that&#39;s where they are</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.880" end="00:23:04.250" style="s2">latent and something about the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:06.800" style="s2">cytokine storm the Cascade the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.250" end="00:23:10.370" style="s2">inflammation cascade that unfolds causes</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.800" end="00:23:11.900" style="s2">pressure on something that causes people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.370" end="00:23:14.510" style="s2">to lose their sense of smell and taste</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.900" end="00:23:16.370" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s one thing they lose their</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.510" end="00:23:18.340" style="s2">sense of smell which degrades their</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.370" end="00:23:21.350" style="s2">sense of taste which would be normal so</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.340" end="00:23:22.970" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s what I think we know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.350" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that conclusion has</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.970" end="00:23:27.010" style="s2">changed very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:29.180" style="s2">in the weeks since we talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.010" end="00:23:32.090" style="s2">but I haven&#39;t run into anything new on</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.180" end="00:23:34.160" style="s2">it but yeah you know the rate of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.090" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">rate of new information is growing about</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.160" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">as quickly as the rate of infections is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:39.980" style="s2">growing in some places it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:41.510" style="s2">hard to keep track of everything which</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.980" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">actually raises one thing I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.510" end="00:23:48.070" style="s2">put a flag here for next time one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:51.860" style="s2">consequences of a highly exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.070" end="00:23:54.680" style="s2">virus is that it may be uh pending many</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.860" end="00:23:57.740" style="s2">of the assumptions that we utilize in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.680" end="00:23:59.570" style="s2">other words what does this virus do may</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.740" end="00:24:01.910" style="s2">not be a good question if the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.570" end="00:24:04.160" style="s2">more variable than we think it is do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.910" end="00:24:06.680" style="s2">test it you know what is the rate of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.160" end="00:24:08.870" style="s2">false positives and or false negatives</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.680" end="00:24:10.790" style="s2">of these tests that may not be a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.870" end="00:24:12.860" style="s2">question because it could be that a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.790" end="00:24:15.429" style="s2">virus from over here on a test</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.860" end="00:24:19.280" style="s2">from over there causes a high rate of</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.429" end="00:24:21.380" style="s2">failures etc and so anyway this is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.280" end="00:24:23.480" style="s2">yet another reason that we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.380" end="00:24:25.940" style="s2">what critter we&#39;re dealing with and does</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.480" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">it have an unusual tendency to change</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.940" end="00:24:30.920" style="s2">that affects the likelihood of a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:32.780" style="s2">functioning it affects the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.920" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">that a vaccine would give permanent</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.780" end="00:24:35.960" style="s2">immunity it affects all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:37.400" style="s2">yeah so this this is something we should</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.960" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">definitely return to this is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.400" end="00:24:40.940" style="s2">we intended to talk about when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:47.419" style="s2">talking about the exploratory nature of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.940" end="00:24:50.360" style="s2">a lab selected virus and the idea we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.419" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">seeing so many tests of you know broadly</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.360" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">three types but out of so many different</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:57.730" style="s2">places with highly variable rates of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:01.070" style="s2">false negative some false positives and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.730" end="00:25:03.740" style="s2">one of the one of the reasons for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.070" end="00:25:06.470" style="s2">hypothesis for why these tests are so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.740" end="00:25:08.600" style="s2">not just imprecise and largely</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.470" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">inaccurate but actually variably</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.600" end="00:25:13.790" style="s2">inaccurate would be that the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:17.480" style="s2">mutating so quickly is evolving so</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.790" end="00:25:18.590" style="s2">quickly that a test generated in an area</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.480" end="00:25:22.460" style="s2">with a particular strain of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.590" end="00:25:24.679" style="s2">may work to find that virus that version</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.460" end="00:25:26.030" style="s2">of the virus but not other strains that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.679" end="00:25:28.250" style="s2">are circulating elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.030" end="00:25:30.710" style="s2">so if true one thing that would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.250" end="00:25:32.809" style="s2">would be that the tests should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.710" end="00:25:36.919" style="s2">basically used in the area in which they</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.809" end="00:25:38.450" style="s2">are first generated and or include</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.919" end="00:25:41.299" style="s2">multiple strains the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.450" end="00:25:45.049" style="s2">antibodies from multiple strains not</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.299" end="00:25:46.850" style="s2">just from one yeah you know obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.049" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">the thing is if it&#39;s happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.850" end="00:25:51.320" style="s2">level of mutation this will leave a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:53.030" style="s2">hallmark that is visible and people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.320" end="00:25:54.320" style="s2">doing sequencing I guess I have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.030" end="00:25:56.510" style="s2">question and maybe it&#39;s just simply</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.320" end="00:25:59.030" style="s2">knowable about whether these are whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.510" end="00:26:01.309" style="s2">genome this is a very large gene oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.030" end="00:26:03.380" style="s2">for a virus it&#39;s like it maxes out viral</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.309" end="00:26:07.240" style="s2">genomes yeah 30 kilobytes or something</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.380" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">Tom yeah but the question is are people</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.240" end="00:26:11.750" style="s2">sequencing the whole thing if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:13.880" style="s2">not you can do a phylogeny by sequencing</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.750" end="00:26:16.430" style="s2">little bits the more of it you sequence</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.880" end="00:26:19.250" style="s2">the better the data you get and the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.430" end="00:26:21.230" style="s2">accurate your phylogeny will be in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.250" end="00:26:22.700" style="s2">less noisy it will be but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.230" end="00:26:24.590" style="s2">what they&#39;re using in order to figure</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:29.660" style="s2">we&#39;re missing it maybe experimenting in</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.460" end="00:26:52.360" style="s2">anything trace what is your current</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:55.910" style="s2">favorite rum I don&#39;t know you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.360" end="00:26:57.350" style="s2">more the older Florida Canas they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.910" end="00:26:59.240" style="s2">very I was just gonna say the older</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.350" end="00:27:02.600" style="s2">Florida Konya and Abuelo&#39;s mutt</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.240" end="00:27:04.850" style="s2">not not bad either well it&#39;s okay there</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.600" end="00:27:07.070" style="s2">are some very fancy ones I should say we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.850" end="00:27:09.680" style="s2">tend to have field biologist instincts</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.070" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">in this in this which is to say you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.680" end="00:27:14.780" style="s2">any dark rum you can come by when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:16.580" style="s2">in the field yeah you know Florida Konya</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.780" end="00:27:18.530" style="s2">is made in Nicaragua it&#39;s been available</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.580" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">in Costa Rica and Panama where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.530" end="00:27:24.290" style="s2">worked but in part our affinity for rum</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:27.410" style="s2">has a lot to do with the fact that a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.290" end="00:27:31.550" style="s2">allergy to wheat takes a huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.410" end="00:27:33.290" style="s2">things off the menu and so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.550" end="00:27:35.690" style="s2">that&#39;s explanatory we were long before</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.290" end="00:27:37.460" style="s2">you discovered an allergy to wheat we</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.690" end="00:27:39.830" style="s2">were drinking rum because rum is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.460" end="00:27:41.330" style="s2">available in Latin America in places</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.830" end="00:27:45.620" style="s2">where there are field stations that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.330" end="00:27:48.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t dry yep and it is reliable that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.620" end="00:27:52.000" style="s2">drinking rum drives away snobs because</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.440" end="00:27:54.740" style="s2">they all look down on it for some reason</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.000" end="00:27:56.060" style="s2">so this is just a comment Tim Poole</p>

<p begin="00:28:07.910" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">not do we have a clear path for</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:16.270" style="s2">that we simply modify a reaction to Cove</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.270" end="00:28:20.570" style="s2">you know I think this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.170" end="00:28:23.750" style="s2">questions and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve addressed each</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.570" end="00:28:27.140" style="s2">of them a bit in other places one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.750" end="00:28:28.190" style="s2">them being there are plenty of vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.140" end="00:28:31.549" style="s2">for RNA virus</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.190" end="00:28:35.029" style="s2">is including was like yellow fever and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.549" end="00:28:36.289" style="s2">various flu viruses and I can t remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.029" end="00:28:38.870" style="s2">there was a long list that we went into</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.289" end="00:28:41.419" style="s2">last time I don&#39;t think yellow fever but</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.870" end="00:28:46.730" style="s2">the flu for sure but we know the fever</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.419" end="00:28:48.950" style="s2">was on there the flu obviously tells us</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.730" end="00:28:53.240" style="s2">that vaccine vaccine is not a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.950" end="00:28:55.549" style="s2">because the flu vaccine is famously</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.240" end="00:28:57.049" style="s2">ineffective in many years and when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.549" end="00:29:01.100" style="s2">effective that effectiveness doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.049" end="00:29:02.840" style="s2">last and so anyway do note that vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.100" end="00:29:04.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we come up with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.840" end="00:29:06.919" style="s2">and suddenly the problem is over it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.940" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">would be lovely if it meant that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.919" end="00:29:12.169" style="s2">vaccine is probably years out and if it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:14.960" style="s2">does occur it might not be a complete</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.169" end="00:29:16.309" style="s2">solution is that can you click on don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.960" end="00:29:18.529" style="s2">put this thing on it could you click on</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.570" end="00:29:33.320" style="s2">here I&#39;ll ask the next question while</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:34.789" style="s2">you answering and I&#39;ll find this do part</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.320" end="00:29:36.470" style="s2">two of previous question share our</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.470" end="00:29:40.669" style="s2">if we have capacity to care for more</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.389" end="00:29:42.200" style="s2">patients is it moral to make Americans</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.200" end="00:29:50.090" style="s2">are open thank you you two are great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:52.879" style="s2">probably missing the meaning of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.090" end="00:29:55.309" style="s2">question I think we have a general</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.879" end="00:29:58.039" style="s2">problem which is that our collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.309" end="00:30:04.460" style="s2">well-being and our individual well-being</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.039" end="00:30:07.490" style="s2">are in many cases at odds and we at some</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.460" end="00:30:11.210" style="s2">level cannot afford to navigate that by</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.490" end="00:30:13.580" style="s2">intuition or by everyone being free to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.210" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">opt in or opt out as they would because</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.580" end="00:30:19.340" style="s2">that will create a game theoretic hazard</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:21.500" style="s2">for those people who feel the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.340" end="00:30:23.240" style="s2">obligation and it will create advantages</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.500" end="00:30:25.940" style="s2">for those who feel the least obligation</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.240" end="00:30:30.220" style="s2">to their fellow man so at some level we</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.940" end="00:30:32.629" style="s2">have to do something that deals with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.220" end="00:30:36.139" style="s2">distinction between the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.629" end="00:30:38.029" style="s2">and the population level that said I</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.139" end="00:30:41.210" style="s2">think one of the things that is driving</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.029" end="00:30:41.779" style="s2">Heather and me crazy is that it appears</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.210" end="00:30:43.639" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.779" end="00:30:46.849" style="s2">many parts of the system that wish to</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.639" end="00:30:49.119" style="s2">resolve this puzzle by lying by</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.849" end="00:30:51.710" style="s2">pretending that the population level</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.710" end="00:30:57.109" style="s2">well-being are the same and that anybody</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.109" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">they are telling is somehow not getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.529" end="00:31:05.359" style="s2">the the scientific reality of it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:09.049" style="s2">this is just not the case it&#39;s time for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.359" end="00:31:11.419" style="s2">us to grow up and talk about free-rider</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.749" end="00:31:23.119" style="s2">they&#39;re imagining things this is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.729" end="00:31:24.589" style="s2">in some ways the central tension that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.119" end="00:31:26.509" style="s2">tends to describe the distinction</p>

<p begin="00:31:26.509" end="00:31:30.950" style="s2">the right is are you more focused on</p>

<p begin="00:34:03.139" end="00:34:07.429" style="s2">for me I believe it is more likely to</p>

<p begin="00:34:07.429" end="00:34:12.409" style="s2">could change I&#39;d be happy to see it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.990" end="00:34:15.589" style="s2">change if it came from the lab I believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.409" end="00:34:17.750" style="s2">the lab that it came from has a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.589" end="00:34:20.359" style="s2">high degree of certainty that it did</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.750" end="00:34:22.780" style="s2">come from the lab it would be very</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.359" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">difficult if this had been something</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.780" end="00:34:27.500" style="s2">well I should say if it is modified by a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">lab they would have a very high degree</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.500" end="00:34:31.460" style="s2">of certainty that it had come from their</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:33.349" style="s2">lab if it was one of many samples and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.460" end="00:34:35.149" style="s2">escaped before it got cataloged or</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.349" end="00:34:37.220" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.149" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">possible that they wouldn&#39;t but I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.220" end="00:34:42.710" style="s2">think that if it came from the lab the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:45.020" style="s2">lab in question knows it and the lab in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.710" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">question might have the instinct to</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.020" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">discuss it openly and honorably if the</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:53.329" style="s2">may not be free to and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.260" end="00:34:55.579" style="s2">things that I would have our audience</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.329" end="00:34:58.339" style="s2">think carefully about is if it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.579" end="00:35:00.260" style="s2">interest of the world to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.339" end="00:35:04.280" style="s2">origin of this and the origin of this is</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.750" end="00:35:10.950" style="s2">free those people who know the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.760" end="00:35:13.530" style="s2">about what this is to tell us what they</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.950" end="00:35:17.250" style="s2">know that&#39;s the question right this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.530" end="00:35:19.470" style="s2">not about vengeance or blame if this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.250" end="00:35:22.020" style="s2">from the lab the chances are this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:24.300" style="s2">result of an error in judgment of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.020" end="00:35:27.180" style="s2">scientific community this was discussed</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.300" end="00:35:28.860" style="s2">I believe in 2015 there was a question</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.180" end="00:35:30.840" style="s2">about gain-of-function research in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.860" end="00:35:32.580" style="s2">coronaviruses discussed in our top</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.840" end="00:35:34.170" style="s2">journals about whether or not this was</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.580" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">safe or might result in some very</p>

<p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:43.410" style="s2">so is this that maybe but if it is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.830" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">2015 we had a chance to stop this kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.410" end="00:35:47.340" style="s2">of research we didn&#39;t this happened in</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">some sense that&#39;s the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.340" end="00:35:50.970" style="s2">community&#39;s responsibility now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:52.950" style="s2">deal with this question completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.970" end="00:35:58.190" style="s2">without prepared pretending that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.950" end="00:35:58.190" style="s2">settled okay next question</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:03.210" style="s2">Bret you&#39;re an evolutionary theorist</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.770" end="00:36:05.250" style="s2">please check out the generational</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.210" end="00:36:06.840" style="s2">hormone hypothesis it explains why the</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.290" end="00:36:30.540" style="s2">would say I&#39;m unclear so a hormone is</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.870" style="s2">basically a signal molecule that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.540" end="00:36:35.850" style="s2">operates at a distance across the body</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.870" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t operate between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.850" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">you could have a pheromone or something</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:43.170" style="s2">that would so anyway I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:46.590" style="s2">referencing some change in hormone</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.170" end="00:36:49.080" style="s2">levels between generations but again we</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.590" end="00:36:51.300" style="s2">have such a novel environment especially</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.080" end="00:36:52.650" style="s2">at the level of hormones with all of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.300" end="00:36:54.360" style="s2">estrogens that we&#39;re putting into the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.650" end="00:36:56.610" style="s2">world in the plastics that we make and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.360" end="00:36:58.500" style="s2">the pesticides that we use we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.610" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">all sorts of things that have nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.500" end="00:37:02.610" style="s2">do with some evolutionary pattern but</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:04.950" style="s2">will affect human physiology and the</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.950" end="00:37:09.060" style="s2">given to livestock yeah the list is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.350" end="00:37:10.890" style="s2">endless of the number of ways that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.890" end="00:37:14.970" style="s2">I&#39;d be interested if there was a good</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.730" end="00:38:09.070" style="s2">doubtful no and I&#39;ve engaged a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.730" end="00:38:11.530" style="s2">those hypotheses and my sense is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.070" end="00:38:14.650" style="s2">actually onto something I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.530" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">a mechanism that is not understood</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.119" end="00:40:00.790" style="s2">that a guy who&#39;s gotten to where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.640" end="00:40:03.309" style="s2">gotten has done so by gambling sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.790" end="00:40:05.559" style="s2">when an individual should be free to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.309" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">it but you don&#39;t do it on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.559" end="00:40:09.339" style="s2">civilization and so it may be that he</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:11.170" style="s2">has gambling in his blood and he&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.339" end="00:40:13.540" style="s2">ready to gamble on all our behalf and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.170" end="00:40:14.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not his to do but I mean it seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.540" end="00:40:16.650" style="s2">like there&#39;s two different questions and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.710" end="00:40:18.490" style="s2">I think you did a little a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.650" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">switching here and you switched the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.490" end="00:40:22.000" style="s2">other question you said I want more Elan</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:23.710" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s fine that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.000" end="00:40:26.410" style="s2">that&#39;s an anti censorship censorship</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.710" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2">position as opposed to what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.410" end="00:40:28.690" style="s2">of what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:30.010" style="s2">so I mean I think we&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.690" end="00:40:33.670" style="s2">careful about threading this needle</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.010" end="00:40:35.920" style="s2">around I want I want all of the opinions</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.670" end="00:40:38.650" style="s2">that want to be voiced to be voice able</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:41.170" style="s2">and findable by those who look at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.650" end="00:40:43.420" style="s2">same time as being able to critique them</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.170" end="00:40:46.510" style="s2">and so you&#39;re just beginning to get into</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.420" end="00:40:49.150" style="s2">why why does it seem like he&#39;s got he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.510" end="00:40:51.190" style="s2">now holding opinions that seem</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.150" end="00:40:55.329" style="s2">potentially dangerous at a public health</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.190" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">level that is worth investigating</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.329" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">while not being in any way suggestive</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:00.760" style="s2">that you think you should therefore</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:02.530" style="s2">either choose to sit down and shut up or</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.760" end="00:41:05.619" style="s2">should be forced to sit down and shut up</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.530" end="00:41:07.240" style="s2">well I I think I want to put this into</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.619" end="00:41:09.460" style="s2">an idiom that you and I have discussed</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.240" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">before so we have talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.460" end="00:41:15.630" style="s2">difference between and the tension</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:18.609" style="s2">between culture and consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.630" end="00:41:21.880" style="s2">that maps onto a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.609" end="00:41:24.099" style="s2">including a distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.880" end="00:41:26.290" style="s2">shamanistic and the sacred mm-hm and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.099" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">think the problem is that Elon okay but</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.290" end="00:41:29.380" style="s2">you just switch those let&#39;s just keep it</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">in the same order culture is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.380" end="00:41:33.819" style="s2">consciousness as the sacred is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">shamanistic perfect yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.819" end="00:41:40.510" style="s2">problem is that because Elon comes</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">across on a high-tech high competence</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.510" end="00:41:48.220" style="s2">channel that that&#39;s his ethos</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:51.819" style="s2">that we tend to read him as more in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.220" end="00:41:53.829" style="s2">sacred cultural mode and in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.819" end="00:41:56.499" style="s2">he may be more shamanistic and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.829" end="00:41:58.809" style="s2">about the shaman is you don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.499" end="00:42:01.499" style="s2">shaman in charge of policy that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.809" end="00:42:05.740" style="s2">the shamans role but the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.499" end="00:42:08.079" style="s2">adventures on to the possible frontier</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.740" end="00:42:10.839" style="s2">and they may come back with visions but</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.079" end="00:42:12.789" style="s2">the point is in order for shamanism to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.839" end="00:42:14.619" style="s2">work you have to not be obligated to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.789" end="00:42:15.640" style="s2">their advice expect most of the visions</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.619" end="00:42:17.559" style="s2">to be nuts</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.640" end="00:42:19.900" style="s2">and some of the visions to sound nuts</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.559" end="00:42:21.640" style="s2">and not be right and there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.900" end="00:42:23.170" style="s2">that elan has some visions that are not</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.640" end="00:42:27.480" style="s2">nuts and then he&#39;s got a bunch of others</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.170" end="00:42:30.309" style="s2">that I find preposterous so maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.480" end="00:42:32.950" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is not only should he</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.309" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">obviously not be censored but that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.950" end="00:42:37.150" style="s2">actually you personally are interested</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:39.039" style="s2">in continuing to have sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.150" end="00:42:40.839" style="s2">ticker-tape of elon continuing to run in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.039" end="00:42:43.150" style="s2">the back of your mind because there will</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.839" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">be he&#39;s in such a mode right now that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.150" end="00:42:45.730" style="s2">it&#39;s become easy to dismiss him and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:46.900" style="s2">lot of people are saying I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.730" end="00:42:48.789" style="s2">want to hear him anymore</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.900" end="00:42:50.680" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying I actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.789" end="00:42:52.809" style="s2">continue to hear the stuff that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.680" end="00:42:54.369" style="s2">out of that guy&#39;s brain because in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.809" end="00:42:55.869" style="s2">past he&#39;s understood some things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.369" end="00:42:57.400" style="s2">the rest of us haven&#39;t and he may be</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.869" end="00:43:00.700" style="s2">about to come to something like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.400" end="00:43:02.049" style="s2">here yes and in fact I want to hear him</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.700" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">even when he&#39;s crazy</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.049" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">right I&#39;m not looking to filter it but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.269" style="s2">want to personally be able to filter it</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.999" style="s2">I want to be able to take any Elan idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.269" end="00:43:17.109" style="s2">and say don&#39;t know what that is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.999" end="00:43:18.910" style="s2">gonna put it aside but I you know I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.109" end="00:43:20.140" style="s2">to hear him during the pandemic I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.910" end="00:43:22.690" style="s2">want to follow his advice because I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.140" end="00:43:26.289" style="s2">think it&#39;s wrong so good anyway I want</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.690" end="00:43:28.529" style="s2">him in the room yeah okay so I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.289" end="00:43:31.420" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna just switch to the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.529" end="00:43:34.779" style="s2">super chat questions and we&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.420" end="00:43:37.059" style="s2">to these if if we have time which I hope</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.779" end="00:43:39.150" style="s2">we do because there are a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.059" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">ones and I apologize that we got through</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.890" end="00:43:50.859" style="s2">are there any organizations that solve</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">societal problems like tissue</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.859" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">regenerators as they grow more numerous</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:55.559" style="s2">and effective we grow stronger in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">short run but</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.559" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">of them become cancerous and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.420" end="00:44:07.979" style="s2">that&#39;s the questions are really pushing</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.670" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">the bounds this time yeah are there can</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.979" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">you read that again are ya put my</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:13.999" style="s2">glasses on are there organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:17.279" style="s2">solve societal problems like tissue</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.279" end="00:44:21.209" style="s2">and effective we grow stronger in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.619" end="00:44:24.359" style="s2">short run but more of them become</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.209" end="00:44:25.799" style="s2">cancerous and dangerous okay so I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.359" end="00:44:30.650" style="s2">- I think we&#39;re both hung up on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.799" end="00:44:32.670" style="s2">tissue - generators yeah frizz I don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.650" end="00:44:35.099" style="s2">already trying to do there any</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.670" end="00:44:36.930" style="s2">organizations trying to do this i want</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.099" end="00:44:38.579" style="s2">to zoom back out on the question I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.930" end="00:44:41.519" style="s2">think organizations is what we want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.579" end="00:44:44.939" style="s2">focus okay there are many processes that</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.519" end="00:44:47.249" style="s2">in their success actually make us</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.939" end="00:44:50.009" style="s2">fragile right and we are seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.249" end="00:44:52.619" style="s2">actually across the board where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.009" end="00:44:57.749" style="s2">relative ease in which we live has</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.619" end="00:45:00.749" style="s2">caused us to become soft and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.749" end="00:45:02.219" style="s2">we are actually we have become incapable</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.749" end="00:45:04.309" style="s2">of doing some of the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.219" end="00:45:07.319" style="s2">necessary and if you look back at</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.309" end="00:45:09.059" style="s2">history we just saw at Zacks</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.319" end="00:45:13.259" style="s2">recommendation we just saw the movie</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.059" end="00:45:17.819" style="s2">1917 which is absolutely excellent but</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.259" end="00:45:23.939" style="s2">it reminds it reminds us of what in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.819" end="00:45:29.819" style="s2">case men had to do right and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.939" end="00:45:33.059" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s astonishing and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.819" end="00:45:35.429" style="s2">that it took tens of millions of Russian</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.059" end="00:45:38.849" style="s2">lives to turn direct the German war</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.429" end="00:45:41.999" style="s2">machine around they had to do it now</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.849" end="00:45:43.229" style="s2">they had an authoritarian state ready to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.999" end="00:45:44.459" style="s2">tell them that they had to do it but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.229" end="00:45:49.380" style="s2">point is it was also in the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.459" end="00:45:52.140" style="s2">character and we have lived with such</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.380" end="00:45:52.979" style="s2">ease that now we have an epidemic of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.140" end="00:45:57.449" style="s2">snowflake eree</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.979" end="00:46:01.140" style="s2">that is the opposite of having what it</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.819" end="00:47:29.910" style="s2">can make you feel alive I think his</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.259" end="00:47:32.099" style="s2">example is skydiving makes you feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.910" end="00:47:35.009" style="s2">alive but it makes you feel maximally</p>

<p begin="00:47:43.140" end="00:47:49.140" style="s2">are actually an important a key piece in</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:53.039" style="s2">the puzzle of keeping your fellow man</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.140" end="00:47:56.190" style="s2">alive is absolutely exhilarating and how</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.150" end="00:48:13.230" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s a question about what</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.190" end="00:48:16.650" style="s2">this has to do with the PTSD that people</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.230" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">come back with absolutely that you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.650" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">they they get it when they come back</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:23.849" style="s2">in general and at some level it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:24.780" style="s2">hard to confront a mundane generic world</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.849" end="00:48:27.510" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.780" end="00:48:31.170" style="s2">even when the alternative is horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.510" end="00:48:33.089" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right what&#39;s more important</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.170" end="00:48:35.910" style="s2">allow open discussion or prevent harmful</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.089" end="00:48:37.500" style="s2">advice who may be bad but it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.910" end="00:48:39.420" style="s2">better most people on YouTube are not</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.500" end="00:48:42.540" style="s2">experts why endanger them what do we get</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.420" end="00:48:44.010" style="s2">love from Russia so what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.540" end="00:48:46.020" style="s2">important to allow open discussion or</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.010" end="00:48:50.579" style="s2">prevent harmful advice allow open</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.020" end="00:48:53.569" style="s2">discussion and it&#39;s not that that answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.579" end="00:48:57.809" style="s2">won&#39;t end up harming some people as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.569" end="00:49:01.349" style="s2">but well I would just add as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.809" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">decide to stop to start protecting</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.349" end="00:49:07.079" style="s2">people from discussion of alternative</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.900" end="00:49:19.260" style="s2">of what is understood and be worse you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.440" end="00:49:21.750" style="s2">get corruption the corrupters will take</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.750" end="00:49:25.079" style="s2">people from bad advice and they will use</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:27.630" style="s2">it to enrich themselves and to hobble</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.079" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">the rest of us and them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.630" end="00:49:31.799" style="s2">absolutely sick of the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">needed to be - we need to be protected</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.799" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">from discussion of anything frankly we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:39.210" style="s2">should be able to handle the discussion</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.010" end="00:49:46.890" style="s2">talk about it like adults and people</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:48.180" style="s2">will respond well it&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.890" end="00:49:49.619" style="s2">people have the sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.180" end="00:49:51.030" style="s2">something you&#39;re not telling them and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.619" end="00:49:52.619" style="s2">that it&#39;s reinforced by the fact that</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.470" end="00:52:56.260" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know where they stand at</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.490" end="00:52:57.430" style="s2">the moment but certainly as of a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.260" end="00:53:03.400" style="s2">weeks ago which is when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.430" end="00:53:05.619" style="s2">about it that was true we have we seen</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.400" end="00:53:07.450" style="s2">Peak prosperity YouTube channel it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.619" end="00:53:08.859" style="s2">been covering kovat since January really</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.450" end="00:53:11.349" style="s2">accurate forecasting a lot of the events</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.859" end="00:53:13.060" style="s2">developed I have not I think I</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.349" end="00:53:16.119" style="s2">encountered it for the first time today</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.060" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">okay um so anyway I had a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.119" end="00:53:20.050" style="s2">and there were some things on it I found</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:21.670" style="s2">disturbing and then there were some</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.050" end="00:53:24.390" style="s2">things that seemed interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.670" end="00:53:26.650" style="s2">anyway it will take a deeper dive yep</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.390" end="00:53:28.920" style="s2">can you talk about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.650" end="00:53:36.420" style="s2">between unique ability and talent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.920" end="00:53:40.540" style="s2">disability trauma in humans yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.420" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">especially now where human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.540" end="00:53:46.030" style="s2">tends to point people in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:49.240" style="s2">of basically trading your time and</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.030" end="00:53:50.740" style="s2">talents doing other people&#39;s bidding in</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.240" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">exchange for money that you then spend</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.740" end="00:53:59.890" style="s2">on frivolous entertainment or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:54:03.310" style="s2">that&#39;s not a recipe for insight to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.890" end="00:54:05.619" style="s2">extent that you face some sort of hazard</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.310" end="00:54:08.230" style="s2">that disrupts normal development that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.619" end="00:54:11.910" style="s2">not a good thing but it opens the door</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.230" end="00:54:14.130" style="s2">to the patterns that will track you into</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.910" end="00:54:17.650" style="s2">useless kagura</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.130" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">and might divert you into something</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.650" end="00:54:23.230" style="s2">useful so in some sense I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:25.060" style="s2">those people who have been disrupted in</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.230" end="00:54:27.190" style="s2">their development have suffered a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.060" end="00:54:30.720" style="s2">setback but it&#39;s one that opens the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.190" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">possibility of ending up somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:36.520" style="s2">distinct and unique each each you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:39.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a the Anna Karenina principle</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.520" end="00:54:41.710" style="s2">you know each happy family is alike each</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.490" end="00:54:44.950" style="s2">unhappy family is unhappy in its own</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.710" end="00:54:49.180" style="s2">unique way every functional airplane is</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.950" end="00:54:52.030" style="s2">alike every disrupted airplane is its</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.180" end="00:54:54.220" style="s2">own unique flying machine there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.030" end="00:54:55.119" style="s2">in which disruption alters things and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.220" end="00:54:58.599" style="s2">makes them unique</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:55:00.579" style="s2">and the result is often failure and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.599" end="00:55:05.410" style="s2">catastrophe but it also opens the door</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.579" end="00:55:07.749" style="s2">to discovery so human development is</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.410" end="00:55:10.990" style="s2">sort of the ghost that haunts so many</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.749" end="00:55:14.049" style="s2">discussions about about human capacity</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.990" end="00:55:16.900" style="s2">yeah now we talked about this fair bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.049" end="00:55:19.990" style="s2">in the childhood chapter of our book as</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:21.309" style="s2">well and and in an otherwise not I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.990" end="00:55:24.009" style="s2">very interesting video I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.309" end="00:55:28.269" style="s2">this and one of the big think videos but</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.009" end="00:55:29.589" style="s2">let me just say that with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.269" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">question is what what is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.589" end="00:55:34.569" style="s2">relationship between unique ability</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.210" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">talent and disability and trauma and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.569" end="00:55:39.099" style="s2">says this is gonna seem semantic but</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:40.749" style="s2">both of us have argued with the framing</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.099" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">of many of the things that are called</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.749" end="00:55:45.190" style="s2">disability as in fact disability and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:46.660" style="s2">specifically a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.190" end="00:55:49.930" style="s2">are now being sort of categorized under</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.660" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">narrow diversity seem to because they</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.930" end="00:55:56.829" style="s2">put a young child out of step with</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:57.819" style="s2">standard sit down face forward shut up</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.829" end="00:55:59.759" style="s2">raise your hand when you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.819" end="00:56:03.190" style="s2">need to use the bathroom model of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.759" end="00:56:05.140" style="s2">schooling if you have anything that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.190" end="00:56:07.569" style="s2">bit different about you that keeps you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.140" end="00:56:08.950" style="s2">from not playing that game perfectly you</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.569" end="00:56:10.749" style="s2">are more likely to then to start seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.950" end="00:56:13.210" style="s2">other problems with the system and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.749" end="00:56:15.809" style="s2">then maybe be forced to in fact develop</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.210" end="00:56:18.609" style="s2">particular talents and so some of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.809" end="00:56:20.680" style="s2">so-called disabilities which you know we</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.609" end="00:56:22.660" style="s2">have argued both of us separately and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.680" end="00:56:25.829" style="s2">together before are not likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.660" end="00:56:30.099" style="s2">disabilities are things like dyslexia or</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.829" end="00:56:33.400" style="s2">ADHD or color blindness even or left</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.099" end="00:56:35.859" style="s2">handedness and and and the list goes on</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.400" end="00:56:39.160" style="s2">and on and on Oh autism spectrum you</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.859" end="00:56:41.109" style="s2">know Asperger&#39;s you know the shallow end</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.160" end="00:56:43.269" style="s2">of the autism spectrum so a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.109" end="00:56:44.980" style="s2">things just allow for you to stand in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.269" end="00:56:46.420" style="s2">slightly different place force you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.980" end="00:56:49.890" style="s2">stand in a slightly different place as</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.420" end="00:56:52.269" style="s2">you try to access the standard model of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.890" end="00:56:55.989" style="s2">resources that society wants to hand to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.269" end="00:56:58.299" style="s2">you and it kind of allows scales to fall</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.989" end="00:57:02.859" style="s2">from the eyes and people to start people</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.299" end="00:57:07.010" style="s2">in such positions to become incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.859" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">seeing the standard-issue school and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.010" end="00:57:10.460" style="s2">employment opportunities and everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:12.260" style="s2">else about society that so many people</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.460" end="00:57:15.130" style="s2">are otherwise just kind of slotting into</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.260" end="00:57:17.900" style="s2">yeah and it also</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.130" end="00:57:21.589" style="s2">cross-culturally at what shamans are</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.900" end="00:57:24.589" style="s2">there are basically a lot of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.589" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">disrupt normal thought and thought does</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.589" end="00:57:28.040" style="s2">not collapse when normal thought is</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:31.400" style="s2">disrupted something else takes its place</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.040" end="00:57:34.579" style="s2">and it is error-prone but insite prone</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.400" end="00:57:37.630" style="s2">at the same time and so anyway human</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.579" end="00:57:40.329" style="s2">populations deal with this and you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.630" end="00:57:43.220" style="s2">you can get there a lot of ways but</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.329" end="00:57:45.380" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way misfits have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.220" end="00:57:47.540" style="s2">a fascination for us for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.380" end="00:57:51.980" style="s2">we saw a lot of what they&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.540" end="00:57:54.800" style="s2">in the classroom and society is so</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.980" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">foolish to throw away their capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.800" end="00:58:03.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re not easy to educate in</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">an economically efficient fashion good I</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.880" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">remember on Joe Rogan I remember on</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:11.480" style="s2">Jerry Joe Rogan said to you the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:15.290" style="s2">Church is a cult and you said back it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.480" end="00:58:18.170" style="s2">not a cult can you elaborate yeah run</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.290" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">afoul of Jill Rogan and Sam Harris once</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.170" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">here but the Catholic Church is I guess</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:27.619" style="s2">the church is not a couple thousand</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">years old but Catholicism is an</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.619" end="00:58:32.420" style="s2">outgrowth of an innovation that goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:34.369" style="s2">back a couple thousand years I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.420" end="00:58:36.950" style="s2">argue it&#39;s an update of an earlier</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.369" end="00:58:38.420" style="s2">innovation you&#39;ve got the Moses version</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.950" end="00:58:42.680" style="s2">then you got the jesus version in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.420" end="00:58:46.579" style="s2">Catholic Church is a a manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.680" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">the Christian update to this compendium</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.579" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">of ancient wisdom is the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:55.550" style="s2">does it have a corruption problem yes it</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">obviously has a pedophilia problem on</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.550" end="00:59:00.200" style="s2">the other hand there&#39;s a reason that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:02.630" style="s2">has persisted over the very long period</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.200" end="00:59:05.089" style="s2">of time that it has and that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.630" end="00:59:09.079" style="s2">with the fact that it actually as costly</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.089" end="00:59:12.500" style="s2">as it is and the belief system is costly</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.079" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">the opportunity cost is very high the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.500" end="00:59:17.240" style="s2">reason that it has persisted is that it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.240" end="00:59:22.609" style="s2">has clearly given advantages to those</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.240" end="00:59:25.180" style="s2">subscribe to it and that is in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.609" end="00:59:27.890" style="s2">with the connotations of cult that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.180" end="00:59:29.780" style="s2">carry with us a cult is an exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.890" end="00:59:31.940" style="s2">version of a belief system where</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.780" end="00:59:34.010" style="s2">somebody offers you the promise of</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.940" end="00:59:36.290" style="s2">something valuable to you but in fact</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.010" end="00:59:40.220" style="s2">what they end up doing is typically</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.290" end="00:59:42.980" style="s2">robbing you blind or in some way getting</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.220" end="00:59:44.450" style="s2">you to enslave yourself to them or</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.980" end="00:59:47.300" style="s2">something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.450" end="00:59:49.849" style="s2">so if you look at the Catholic Church</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.300" end="00:59:54.980" style="s2">you have to take it as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.849" end="00:59:56.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s been a lot of bad but it it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.980" end="00:59:59.510" style="s2">is coupled to something that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.990" end="01:00:03.230" style="s2">obviously served Catholics well over a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.510" end="01:00:06.800" style="s2">long period of time the next one i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:00:15.650" end="01:00:21.050" style="s2">me I will say it&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve saw</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:24.380" style="s2">that as you were talking I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.050" end="01:00:26.450" style="s2">about it and as you know I strangely I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.380" end="01:00:30.849" style="s2">have an ability that I didn&#39;t know I had</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.450" end="01:00:33.319" style="s2">to actually imitate voices of people</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.849" end="01:00:36.349" style="s2">compellingly and it has never occurred</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.319" end="01:00:39.079" style="s2">to me to do you and I think I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.349" end="01:00:43.460" style="s2">tried and I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.079" end="01:00:45.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re too close yeah well no</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.460" end="01:00:47.900" style="s2">I there&#39;s no text here really I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.799" end="01:00:50.839" style="s2">think I think it would be easier if we</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.900" end="01:00:53.420" style="s2">had a sentence written by the other to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.839" end="01:00:55.700" style="s2">imitate it where are we it&#39;s I&#39;m on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.420" end="01:00:57.260" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s this one but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.700" end="01:01:00.290" style="s2">the comment is just read this comment</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.260" end="01:01:02.900" style="s2">imitating oh yeah it&#39;s funny you know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.290" end="01:01:06.049" style="s2">think this actually lines up if you try</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.900" end="01:01:08.569" style="s2">to conjure the face of somebody that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.049" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">know well in the absence of a picture of</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.569" end="01:01:12.920" style="s2">them or them sitting in front of you</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:14.540" style="s2">it&#39;s often kind of hard to do um I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.920" end="01:01:16.630" style="s2">this is a little bit like that where</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.540" end="01:01:19.609" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.630" end="01:01:22.609" style="s2">you&#39;re not a picture of you you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.609" end="01:01:27.650" style="s2">know a hundred thousand different images</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.609" end="01:01:30.589" style="s2">and different like we live in each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.650" end="01:01:33.140" style="s2">as well you know it&#39;s it&#39;s so close</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.589" end="01:01:34.849" style="s2">yeah that it&#39;s really hard to separate</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.140" end="01:01:39.380" style="s2">maybe it may be hope maybe I&#39;ll work on</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.849" end="01:01:41.150" style="s2">it but at the moment there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.380" end="01:01:42.529" style="s2">little separation at all you know we</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.150" end="01:01:48.289" style="s2">just have no distance from one another</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.529" end="01:01:50.420" style="s2">that I think I think imitation how</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.289" end="01:01:52.339" style="s2">required is some distance in order to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.420" end="01:01:54.729" style="s2">get perspective all right well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.339" end="01:01:57.710" style="s2">gonna see if you can figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.729" end="01:01:59.719" style="s2">to impersonate me and if you would do me</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.710" end="01:02:01.460" style="s2">a favor and also figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.719" end="01:02:03.109" style="s2">impersonate me impersonating you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.460" end="01:02:10.339" style="s2">absolutely really take the pressure off</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.109" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">okay okay so we&#39;re really close to down</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.339" end="01:02:13.910" style="s2">to so many good questions here guys I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:15.499" style="s2">gonna read two more out of this one and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.910" end="01:02:16.999" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go back I think and let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.499" end="01:02:20.059" style="s2">put one other from the other super chat</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.999" end="01:02:21.559" style="s2">and and then we&#39;ll stop for today okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.059" end="01:02:24.769" style="s2">so there next to an order here a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.559" end="01:02:26.479" style="s2">follow-up from echo Johnny Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.769" end="01:02:28.759" style="s2">replied to you Brett and the Harris</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.479" end="01:02:30.529" style="s2">debate quote that&#39;s why the process by</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.759" end="01:02:32.239" style="s2">which the knowledge is updated has to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.529" end="01:02:34.130" style="s2">occupy a position in the hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.239" end="01:02:37.009" style="s2">values that supersedes their reliance on</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.130" end="01:02:38.839" style="s2">dogma how do you disagree yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.009" end="01:02:40.549" style="s2">great quote from Peterson yeah it is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.839" end="01:02:44.509" style="s2">great quote um I mean I must say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.549" end="01:02:46.369" style="s2">think Peterson and I disagree that</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.509" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">intensely and in fact what he</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.369" end="01:02:52.839" style="s2">acknowledged during I guess it was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:56.599" style="s2">second night of debates in Vancouver I</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.839" end="01:02:59.239" style="s2">regard it as an essentially completely</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.599" end="01:03:01.940" style="s2">satisfying acknowledgment of the point I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.239" end="01:03:06.069" style="s2">was trying to make that allows me to see</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.940" end="01:03:10.489" style="s2">his point as valid right behaving as if</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.069" end="01:03:12.589" style="s2">has clear value and it has limits and he</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.489" end="01:03:17.979" style="s2">sees both so I&#39;m not sure our position</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.589" end="01:03:20.890" style="s2">in the end is substantially different</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.979" end="01:03:23.749" style="s2">what he&#39;s saying here I have trouble</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.890" end="01:03:25.940" style="s2">interpreting I mean I I think if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.749" end="01:03:30.289" style="s2">translate what I think he&#39;s saying into</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.940" end="01:03:32.180" style="s2">our language the compendium of wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.289" end="01:03:35.630" style="s2">not I mean if you have you ever tried to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.180" end="01:03:37.849" style="s2">read a Bible it don&#39;t work right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.630" end="01:03:41.539" style="s2">self contradictory it&#39;s not a novel</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.849" end="01:03:44.210" style="s2">right it requires something to interpret</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.539" end="01:03:46.849" style="s2">to highlight this section to downplay</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.210" end="01:03:50.539" style="s2">that section with reference to history</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.849" end="01:03:53.210" style="s2">and what I would say is this creates the</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.539" end="01:03:55.969" style="s2">possibility of the compendium of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.210" end="01:03:58.999" style="s2">functioning far better as a living</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.969" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">document with why&#39;s interpreters then it</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.999" end="01:04:05.569" style="s2">can function as just simply an</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:09.559" style="s2">instruction manual but even the process</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.569" end="01:04:13.069" style="s2">whereby the folks who decide what to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.559" end="01:04:16.130" style="s2">emphasize can be wise and farsighted</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.069" end="01:04:17.569" style="s2">that has limits to and then this is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.130" end="01:04:19.940" style="s2">point that we&#39;ve been making which has</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.569" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">now become a theme of the Q&amp;A here which</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.940" end="01:04:26.239" style="s2">is the the priestly sacred and the</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.670" end="01:07:25.640" style="s2">before transmission becomes likely so is</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.460" end="01:07:27.230" style="s2">viral load in the air question suggested</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.640" end="01:07:30.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not exactly fleet like I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.230" end="01:07:32.930" style="s2">about a yep flea infestation is that if</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.260" end="01:07:35.180" style="s2">it&#39;s the wrong flea you know pregnant</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.930" end="01:07:39.050" style="s2">flea leaves on dia now you&#39;re in Festiva</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.180" end="01:07:42.230" style="s2">fleas in this case the flea is more</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.050" end="01:07:43.650" style="s2">analogous to a sufficiently dense cloud</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.230" end="01:07:46.620" style="s2">of these particles</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.650" end="01:07:47.730" style="s2">and so what I think what my model you</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.620" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">and I are walking down the street in</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.730" end="01:07:52.380" style="s2">Portland the other day um yes we had to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.600" style="s2">be out there they&#39;re walking down the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.380" end="01:07:57.270" style="s2">street we were walking by some homeless</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.600" end="01:08:01.310" style="s2">people they were eating on a wall</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.270" end="01:08:04.950" style="s2">somewhere and one of them coughed and</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.310" end="01:08:06.690" style="s2">the point was okay this person may be</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.950" end="01:08:07.860" style="s2">sick with kovat 19</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.690" end="01:08:10.020" style="s2">I almost people have many fewer</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.860" end="01:08:11.850" style="s2">resources to protect themselves that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.020" end="01:08:14.460" style="s2">cough may have contained droplets a</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.850" end="01:08:16.260" style="s2">brief encounter with that cloud is</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.460" end="01:08:18.180" style="s2">unlikely to transmit the disease</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.260" end="01:08:22.500" style="s2">possible absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.180" end="01:08:24.780" style="s2">likely no standing where that cloud was</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.500" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">greatly increases to likelihood and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.780" end="01:08:29.100" style="s2">you just saw that guy&#39;s friends are more</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:31.680" style="s2">likely to become infected by hanging out</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.100" end="01:08:35.790" style="s2">with him than we are by walking by him</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.680" end="01:08:39.150" style="s2">right and so I think we all need to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.790" end="01:08:41.700" style="s2">update our model where every time you</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.150" end="01:08:43.410" style="s2">enter a circumstance where you may have</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.700" end="01:08:45.390" style="s2">just walked into a cloud of the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.410" end="01:08:47.130" style="s2">that you cannot see you walk into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.390" end="01:08:48.480" style="s2">space into an elevator and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.130" end="01:08:51.840" style="s2">know if somebody just got out of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.480" end="01:08:56.010" style="s2">elevator who had it and coughed right</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.840" end="01:08:57.930" style="s2">hey hey stop watch starts the longer you</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.010" end="01:09:00.390" style="s2">stay there the more you breathe while</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.930" end="01:09:02.850" style="s2">you&#39;re there the more you will cross the</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.390" end="01:09:05.520" style="s2">threshold in which exposure that does</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.850" end="01:09:07.950" style="s2">not cause an infection crosses over into</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.520" end="01:09:13.590" style="s2">an infection and so if you take that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.950" end="01:09:15.900" style="s2">model and you allow it to modify your</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.590" end="01:09:17.670" style="s2">behavior you can actually greatly reduce</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.900" end="01:09:21.810" style="s2">the chances of catching this thing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.670" end="01:09:23.340" style="s2">that is what we should be doing and boy</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.810" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">I wish we were all on the same page</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.340" end="01:09:27.390" style="s2">about this I really this is a moment at</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:29.460" style="s2">which the world could be galvanized</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.390" end="01:09:32.520" style="s2">where we would all be learning in tandem</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.460" end="01:09:34.200" style="s2">about the danger we face how it is best</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.520" end="01:09:36.360" style="s2">managed and we could manage this thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.200" end="01:09:42.870" style="s2">into oblivion but not if we&#39;re tearing</p>
