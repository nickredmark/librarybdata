<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.040" style="s2">do this interview and help me get my</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">thoughts down like I said I&#39;m better at</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:11.190" style="s2">doing this in a conversation so why are</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">we creating it&#39;s good so I have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.190" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">idea for a technology cooperative a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">of it comes from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.369" style="s2">technology right now in our lives is so</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:23.160" style="s2">powerful before this point in history we</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">weren&#39;t able to be doing what I it is I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.160" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">want to do so technology connects us</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:29.429" style="s2">like we&#39;ve never been connected before</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:31.529" style="s2">it also informs us somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.429" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">problematically but we do get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.529" end="00:00:35.730" style="s2">information our fingertips on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">Internet and it makes a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.730" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">possible that would have never been</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">possible before so it has a great impact</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:45.690" style="s2">on our lives but currently technology is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">owned by mainly for companies at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.690" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">the technology I&#39;m talking about Amazon</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:53.190" style="s2">Google Facebook and Apple and they have</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">a lot of money and a lot of power and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.190" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">they gain more and more as the months</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">and years go by as they both create</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">their own products and amalgamate you</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:06.530" style="s2">know buy other people&#39;s products so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">I propose is we create a tech co-op</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.530" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">especially a user slash platform</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">cooperative that is like the Netflix of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">apps that we run together with liquid</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">democracy and complete transparency we</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">use it to create the tools that connect</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">us and inform us and meet our basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">needs as well as basically everything we</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.490" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">desire it doesn&#39;t hand you what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:35.329" style="s2">desire but it gives you the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">empower yourself to co-create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.329" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">so everything in the tech cooperative is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">voluntary it&#39;s all about empowering the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:47.820" style="s2">individual with their own freedom but</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">like collectively we&#39;re able to wield</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.820" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">our power on behalf of every single one</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">of us so you don&#39;t have to create an app</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">we are creating it together but nor do</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">you have to use it and you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">say in what features is created so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">idea is to adjust to this but empower to</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">create a world that works for you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">given the tools to do that whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:10.140" style="s2">that&#39;s finding the group&#39;s finding that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">the projects to work on or just saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.140" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">this is what&#39;s not working for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:14.550" style="s2">and being</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:18.150" style="s2">with other people to co-create as</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.550" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">leukemic back together we the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.150" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">piece is that we&#39;re able to do it better</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">than those four companies I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:26.490" style="s2">mentioned can do because they have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">it in secrecy or they have to do it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.490" end="00:02:30.210" style="s2">opposition to the other user they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:32.850" style="s2">doing it for their user they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.210" end="00:02:34.530" style="s2">to make money so we have more trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.850" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">built into our model we have more</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.530" end="00:02:39.390" style="s2">efficiency built into our model and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">design for diversity we&#39;re not designing</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.390" end="00:02:43.320" style="s2">for the 90% we&#39;re designing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">everybody which means designing for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.320" end="00:02:50.750" style="s2">fringes and the word here that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">read without liar the outlier of all</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.750" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">diversity so what I imagine when we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">the Netflix of apps and everything we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">need to create as creator or at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">like let&#39;s say a dozen tools that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">unlocks humanity is that we unlock</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:06.060" style="s2">humanity we get all of humanity&#39;s genius</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:07.890" style="s2">now we don&#39;t get to like co-op people</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.060" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">who don&#39;t want to be part of it but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.890" end="00:03:12.990" style="s2">get to when we release people from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">monotony of their day-to-day lives of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.990" end="00:03:16.320" style="s2">having to go to a job to put food on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:20.360" style="s2">table and having to go to a job</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.320" end="00:03:22.740" style="s2">different a roof over their head we get</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">to unleash their genius and we get all</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.740" end="00:03:27.600" style="s2">of the innovation that comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">so that is good the Netflix app says go</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.600" end="00:03:32.820" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s very exciting as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">way that you land out there but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.820" end="00:03:37.170" style="s2">curious how do we get there what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:38.550" style="s2">start of that process and then how does</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.170" end="00:03:42.570" style="s2">that sort of unfold at least in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.550" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">current plans of this so that is a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.570" end="00:03:46.200" style="s2">piece of what I&#39;ve been working on is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">you know like I said there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.200" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">dozens of ideas but how do we in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">for like one to be created one has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">exist like in order for me to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">create it I need the thing that helps me</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:58.860" style="s2">create a team and the thing that helps</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:03:59.489" style="s2">you run a team because I can&#39;t do it by</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:03.180" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.489" end="00:04:06.540" style="s2">so how I see it starting is our first</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.180" end="00:04:08.160" style="s2">project is the idea Cafe which is going</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.540" end="00:04:10.200" style="s2">to be a platform design and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.160" end="00:04:12.390" style="s2">to be a social media platform design for</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.200" end="00:04:15.239" style="s2">humanity to have a real conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">from those conversations we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.239" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">be creating ideas we&#39;re gonna get you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:23.550" style="s2">can&#39;t help but have ideas come out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">conversations it may be we&#39;re not able</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.550" end="00:04:25.630" style="s2">to move forward on those ideas because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:26.890" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:30.040" style="s2">tools to do it but then we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.890" end="00:04:31.660" style="s2">those conversations about what tool</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.040" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">would help us do that we just created</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.660" end="00:04:35.350" style="s2">you know over the last few months dozens</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">of ideas but none of them you know there</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.350" end="00:04:40.390" style="s2">wasn&#39;t organic groups that forms and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">made these things magically and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.390" end="00:04:45.670" style="s2">looking at having people be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.430" end="00:04:47.410" style="s2">voice what would empower them to do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.670" end="00:04:49.960" style="s2">work right what would empower them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.410" end="00:04:51.670" style="s2">well I&#39;m just I can&#39;t find a group on my</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.960" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">own I need people to come and be part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.670" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">it right so that would be a tool how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:57.850" style="s2">you find a group of people to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">with how do you create in a larger group</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.850" end="00:05:04.450" style="s2">and so I have a lot of ideas on contest</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:09.190" style="s2">to be run and ways to to work through an</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.450" end="00:05:10.930" style="s2">app creation as a whole that but all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.190" end="00:05:12.760" style="s2">the ideas that I&#39;ve created are going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.930" end="00:05:15.190" style="s2">be more powerful when they come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.760" end="00:05:19.420" style="s2">organically from us having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.190" end="00:05:21.400" style="s2">because then we have the passion behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.420" end="00:05:23.920" style="s2">it right like people want to co-create</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.400" end="00:05:26.110" style="s2">something that they helped co-create but</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.920" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">they like really yes let&#39;s let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.110" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">out what&#39;s going wrong and create it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:32.050" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:34.540" style="s2">so the idea Cafe will be a space for</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.050" end="00:05:38.070" style="s2">anyone to come and discuss world events</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.540" end="00:05:41.080" style="s2">discuss problems discuss anything that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.070" end="00:05:42.520" style="s2">would spark a solution and then from</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.080" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">those conversations we&#39;re creating the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.520" end="00:05:49.360" style="s2">tools to make it all possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">Cocco so just in terms of the social</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:53.080" style="s2">media platform itself how would you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:55.300" style="s2">distinguish it from other social media</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.080" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">platforms in terms of functionality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.300" end="00:05:58.690" style="s2">you know features anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.220" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">because we have had a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.690" end="00:06:03.880" style="s2">this previously and you said that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:05.320" style="s2">was a different way that the site was</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.880" end="00:06:07.390" style="s2">going to be centered rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.320" end="00:06:09.220" style="s2">text-based I think you were saying it</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.390" end="00:06:13.870" style="s2">was gonna be more video based and video</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.220" end="00:06:15.790" style="s2">absorb yes so the idea is the simple</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.870" end="00:06:18.010" style="s2">version is you come on there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.790" end="00:06:20.890" style="s2">question a day when we start and you get</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.010" end="00:06:23.140" style="s2">to be matched up in your what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.890" end="00:06:25.870" style="s2">like your schedule when you&#39;re free you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.140" end="00:06:27.730" style="s2">are matched up with two to three other</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.870" end="00:06:30.070" style="s2">people to have a conversation around a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.730" end="00:06:31.480" style="s2">meaningful question and together we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:34.360" style="s2">gonna be generating what those questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.480" end="00:06:36.760" style="s2">are to powerfully move us forward as we</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.360" end="00:06:40.150" style="s2">grow we can go from having one question</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.760" end="00:06:41.830" style="s2">today that&#39;s going to be maybe not spark</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.150" end="00:06:44.530" style="s2">everyone&#39;s interest to having more than</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.830" end="00:06:46.480" style="s2">East quad in each these questions having</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.530" end="00:06:49.180" style="s2">one that&#39;s focuses on climate change or</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.480" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">poverty reduction or food creation and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.180" end="00:06:53.080" style="s2">whatever it is that you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.550" style="s2">empowered to co-create with other people</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.080" end="00:06:57.430" style="s2">that&#39;s where you want to have those</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.550" end="00:06:59.110" style="s2">conversations so the idea is everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.430" end="00:07:00.370" style="s2">has an account and they say when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.110" end="00:07:02.260" style="s2">available they say what they care about</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:03.790" style="s2">and we match them up to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.260" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">conversation they don&#39;t just have one</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.790" end="00:07:07.930" style="s2">conversation the idea is hopefully they</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:09.070" style="s2">have multiple conversations so that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.930" end="00:07:10.900" style="s2">larger group is able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.070" end="00:07:12.280" style="s2">conversation because if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.900" end="00:07:13.690" style="s2">with four different people and then we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.280" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">all go to spur stand talk with the new</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.690" end="00:07:17.020" style="s2">four people and go to first and talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:18.910" style="s2">with the new four people the larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.020" end="00:07:20.740" style="s2">group is able to have a conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.910" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">think a lot of social media right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.740" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">first of all is set up for profit which</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:27.370" style="s2">means they have a very different</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:29.320" style="s2">incentive part of which is they make</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.370" end="00:07:31.420" style="s2">money off of debate they make money off</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.320" end="00:07:34.020" style="s2">of division it keeps us on there longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.420" end="00:07:37.300" style="s2">they make money off of our addiction and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.020" end="00:07:40.480" style="s2">we can create something that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.300" end="00:07:42.370" style="s2">real connection and empowers us to just</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.480" end="00:07:44.230" style="s2">meet with our fellow humans face to face</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.370" end="00:07:46.600" style="s2">and see that there are good people</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.230" end="00:07:49.480" style="s2">mostly that they&#39;re intelligent people</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.600" end="00:07:51.250" style="s2">mostly and the ones that we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.480" end="00:07:53.770" style="s2">along with we&#39;ll find someone else to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.250" end="00:07:56.020" style="s2">get along with like we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.770" end="00:07:57.580" style="s2">space that brings humanity together for</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.020" end="00:07:59.620" style="s2">a conversation and none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.580" end="00:08:01.570" style="s2">doing that there&#39;s like I said existing</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.620" end="00:08:03.460" style="s2">for profit we don&#39;t own them so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.570" end="00:08:05.890" style="s2">say what&#39;s not working about them and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.460" end="00:08:08.410" style="s2">can&#39;t work to improve them we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.890" end="00:08:11.020" style="s2">them they can choose to act on it or not</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.410" end="00:08:12.610" style="s2">but they&#39;re not there to make it a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.020" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">better experience for us they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.610" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">to make it a better experience for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">total enough that we give them that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:24.910" style="s2">get money yeah and we have been using</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:26.590" style="s2">zome and we&#39;ve got a Facebook group and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.910" end="00:08:28.450" style="s2">things like that and we&#39;ve had some</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.590" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">really interesting conversations sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.450" end="00:08:32.140" style="s2">coming together as large groups and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:34.270" style="s2">splitting off into smaller bubbles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.140" end="00:08:36.849" style="s2">having discussions around there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.270" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">working really good you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.849" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">exciting the things that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:40.540" style="s2">talking about and this is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:41.830" style="s2">product from this so if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.540" end="00:08:43.540" style="s2">social media platform that was</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.830" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">specifically designed around these sorts</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.540" end="00:08:46.900" style="s2">of things I would definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.760" style="s2">interested in jumping on board and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.900" end="00:08:50.710" style="s2">hopefully generating some solutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.760" end="00:08:53.110" style="s2">because we live in pretty strange time</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.710" end="00:08:56.710" style="s2">at the moment and so you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.110" end="00:08:59.470" style="s2">more cohesion less division least people</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.710" end="00:09:05.770" style="s2">making money off of our division I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.470" end="00:09:09.190" style="s2">would be a very good thing okay so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">go on to some of the criticisms of just</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.190" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">cooperatives and social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.200" end="00:09:21.220" style="s2">yeah yeah well unfortunately we live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.210" end="00:09:22.930" style="s2">a pretty difficult world there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.220" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">of competition and saturation things</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.930" end="00:09:28.230" style="s2">like that but yeah did a bit of research</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:31.570" style="s2">just to see sort of hat wire coops fail</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.230" end="00:09:33.370" style="s2">and one of them would be how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.570" end="00:09:35.830" style="s2">incentivize people to do the work that</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.370" end="00:09:37.150" style="s2">is required so how do you get the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.830" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">because you&#39;re not a tech person</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.150" end="00:09:41.920" style="s2">yourself but you&#39;re hoping to attract</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.100" end="00:09:44.020" style="s2">and tick people and bring them in so how</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.920" end="00:09:46.090" style="s2">will you incentivize those B so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.020" end="00:09:48.400" style="s2">people doing the tech work the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.090" end="00:09:50.710" style="s2">people are having the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.400" end="00:09:52.750" style="s2">spark the ideas aren&#39;t getting paid</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.710" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">that&#39;s payment in and of itself it ought</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.750" end="00:09:56.050" style="s2">to be part of that being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:58.180" style="s2">co-create together however when</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:10:00.970" style="s2">someone&#39;s full-time job is coding or</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.180" end="00:10:04.270" style="s2">doing the graphics or doing that piece</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.970" end="00:10:06.730" style="s2">of it they&#39;re going to get paid and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:09.930" style="s2">we are incentivizing them in the regular</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:12.550" style="s2">way we&#39;re also asking though</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.930" end="00:10:14.770" style="s2">with everything we have with labor like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.550" end="00:10:16.330" style="s2">not just for our cooperative but also</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.770" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">when we create a labor platform</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.330" end="00:10:20.110" style="s2">what can incentivize you beyond money</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:22.120" style="s2">right what makes your life better that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:23.980" style="s2">isn&#39;t increasing your paycheck because</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.120" end="00:10:25.810" style="s2">if we increase your paycheck we have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.980" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">increase everyone&#39;s paycheck whereas if</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.810" end="00:10:30.250" style="s2">we create a healthcare system for you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">that your pain into like everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.250" end="00:10:34.660" style="s2">pay into then everybody gets that if</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:36.220" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a way for you to eat</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.660" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">organic food that you have to put lace</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.220" end="00:10:40.960" style="s2">labor into everybody that&#39;s that so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:43.900" style="s2">are looking for ways to solve the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.960" end="00:10:46.570" style="s2">incentivization problem for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.900" end="00:10:48.010" style="s2">I&#39;m like how do we get you more of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.570" end="00:10:50.650" style="s2">you need to do right if your house gets</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.010" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">cleaned you can spend more time on tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.650" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a coder I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:59.290" style="s2">that skill but I might be able to clean</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:11:01.300" style="s2">house so to begin with it might be quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.290" end="00:11:03.280" style="s2">difficult just because like we&#39;re where</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.300" end="00:11:04.420" style="s2">is that money coming from it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.280" end="00:11:06.339" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you know billion</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.420" end="00:11:10.389" style="s2">is investing in it or anything at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.339" end="00:11:12.040" style="s2">point in time that&#39;s around getting sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.389" end="00:11:16.810" style="s2">of the initial payments going and sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.040" end="00:11:19.300" style="s2">of previously like months and months ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.810" end="00:11:21.190" style="s2">was the idea of the Netflix of app so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.300" end="00:11:22.690" style="s2">the idea is we&#39;re paying into a pool and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.190" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">then voting on where that money goes</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.690" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">which means people are putting ten</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:29.470" style="s2">dollars a month into that money and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:32.620" style="s2">is depending on our Thresh our are</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.470" end="00:11:34.300" style="s2">starting threshold a lot of money to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.620" end="00:11:35.470" style="s2">work with like if you have ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.300" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">people each putting in ten dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.470" end="00:11:38.769" style="s2">month that&#39;s a hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:41.740" style="s2">a month to work and create apps with</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.769" end="00:11:43.029" style="s2">however we have nothing to offer them so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.740" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not putting in ten dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.029" end="00:11:45.130" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:46.570" style="s2">they&#39;d be putting in like a crowdfunding</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.130" end="00:11:48.430" style="s2">campaign where they&#39;re putting in just</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.570" end="00:11:50.769" style="s2">ten dollars and we&#39;re using that hundred</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.430" end="00:11:53.860" style="s2">thousand to create our first project</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.769" end="00:11:55.029" style="s2">that in this case isn&#39;t the idea Cafe</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.860" end="00:11:59.579" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think people would pay</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.029" end="00:11:59.579" style="s2">for the idea cafe it doesn&#39;t give them a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.610" end="00:12:06.040" style="s2">in a regular game a solution right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.790" end="00:12:07.420" style="s2">not making life easier it&#39;s it is but</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.040" end="00:12:08.890" style="s2">like it&#39;s not regular life easier it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.420" end="00:12:11.620" style="s2">not getting them more food for cheaper</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.890" end="00:12:13.649" style="s2">those those incentives one of which</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.620" end="00:12:16.600" style="s2">could be to create the labor platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.649" end="00:12:17.829" style="s2">because the labor platform that helps us</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.600" end="00:12:19.660" style="s2">you know we create the uber the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.829" end="00:12:22.029" style="s2">TaskRabbit all of that that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.660" end="00:12:23.949" style="s2">collectively owned together we create it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.029" end="00:12:25.779" style="s2">so it&#39;s not for profit so more money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.949" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">going between the transaction with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.779" end="00:12:30.730" style="s2">tiny percentage going to create the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:32.500" style="s2">platform we can vote on what a tax is we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.730" end="00:12:36.699" style="s2">can vote on what that platform money is</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.500" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">and that can be used to create all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.699" end="00:12:41.110" style="s2">the tech but I do think matter to have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:42.310" style="s2">$10 a month fee that we all say because</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.110" end="00:12:43.779" style="s2">then we&#39;re also knowing the people that</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.310" end="00:12:45.370" style="s2">are pretty pain into other people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.779" end="00:12:48.430" style="s2">won&#39;t care about it people who see the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.370" end="00:12:51.069" style="s2">vision and want to co-create a global</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.430" end="00:12:53.709" style="s2">tech weapon yep so you would start with</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.069" end="00:12:57.430" style="s2">something like err Tasker or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.709" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">that&#39;s connect individuals to get you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.430" end="00:13:02.260" style="s2">jobs and working things like start with</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:05.500" style="s2">one of the ideas that is a money</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.260" end="00:13:07.660" style="s2">generator it isn&#39;t and so something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.500" end="00:13:09.670" style="s2">offers value to people and a percentage</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.660" end="00:13:11.139" style="s2">goes into the pool so that you&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.670" end="00:13:12.610" style="s2">need money we need money to create web</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.139" end="00:13:14.920" style="s2">so there has to be a way to make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.610" end="00:13:17.139" style="s2">money either it&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.920" end="00:13:19.540" style="s2">enough of us that it&#39;s it&#39;s by donation</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.139" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">we have yes everyone puts any $10 I like</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.540" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">that because I think it&#39;s more fair I</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:26.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s more we all have an equal</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:28.989" style="s2">payment in and we therefore all have an</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.290" end="00:13:32.290" style="s2">equal voice yeah okay well there are</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.989" end="00:13:33.730" style="s2">already a few sites that exist social</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.290" end="00:13:35.619" style="s2">media sites that I don&#39;t think they have</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.730" end="00:13:38.470" style="s2">quite the grand vision that you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.619" end="00:13:40.540" style="s2">outlined but a lot of them are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.470" end="00:13:43.689" style="s2">move away from because our information</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.540" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">is sort of collected and sold and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.689" end="00:13:50.139" style="s2">there&#39;s not much transparency around</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:53.949" style="s2">what&#39;s happening for them so yeah places</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.139" end="00:13:56.529" style="s2">like a diaspora sorry I Oh mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.949" end="00:13:59.079" style="s2">these places are all kind of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.529" end="00:14:01.269" style="s2">them use blockchain as well as part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.079" end="00:14:04.059" style="s2">the technology to try to decentralize it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.269" end="00:14:05.559" style="s2">and give users more control why not can</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.059" end="00:14:07.059" style="s2">it connect with those people and try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.559" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">team up with them instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.059" end="00:14:11.829" style="s2">build something from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:12.999" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things in which I do think</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.829" end="00:14:14.169" style="s2">we need to start from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.999" end="00:14:16.209" style="s2">there needs to be enough people</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.169" end="00:14:18.549" style="s2">co-creating it together and it&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.209" end="00:14:20.730" style="s2">openly and transparently that anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.549" end="00:14:23.949" style="s2">comes on board can see how we got there</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.730" end="00:14:25.720" style="s2">if somebody was doing something amazing</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.949" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">and was willing to have me on board I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.720" end="00:14:28.600" style="s2">would absolutely go be part of that as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:30.819" style="s2">long as there was a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.600" end="00:14:32.860" style="s2">foundation like we&#39;re all gonna own it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.819" end="00:14:34.929" style="s2">together not us gonna own it together</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.860" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">and then sell it to everybody else but</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.929" end="00:14:38.559" style="s2">we are gonna own it together humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:41.679" style="s2">gonna own it together or whoever would</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.559" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">never members choose to opt in I need it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.679" end="00:14:45.509" style="s2">to be democratic or have something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:48.009" style="s2">is better than democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.509" end="00:14:49.689" style="s2">transparency nearly complete</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.009" end="00:14:51.160" style="s2">transparency I don&#39;t want decisions</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.689" end="00:14:54.730" style="s2">being made free behind closed doors that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.160" end="00:14:56.619" style="s2">I don&#39;t get to be privy to and so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.730" end="00:14:59.079" style="s2">other option is although they yes you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.619" end="00:15:00.819" style="s2">own your data a lot of times that means</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.079" end="00:15:02.470" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to share it that means</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.819" end="00:15:04.989" style="s2">you don&#39;t I mean like what we do on</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:09.189" style="s2">Facebook what we do on Amazon what we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.989" end="00:15:11.589" style="s2">on Google we are the the commodity hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.189" end="00:15:13.329" style="s2">it&#39;s our data there&#39;s so many more</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.589" end="00:15:17.619" style="s2">powerful things we could be using our</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.329" end="00:15:19.179" style="s2">data for than selling us more crap or</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.619" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">rigging elections or you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.179" end="00:15:23.559" style="s2">mean that that kind of thing we can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.929" style="s2">using our data to cure cancer to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.559" end="00:15:29.110" style="s2">our lives better to do and so having</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.929" end="00:15:29.560" style="s2">systems that uses our data voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.110" end="00:15:32.170" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.560" end="00:15:33.310" style="s2">safely so you can opt into it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.170" end="00:15:35.500" style="s2">think is what they&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.310" end="00:15:38.230" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to create keep your data</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.500" end="00:15:40.060" style="s2">to yourself right and so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.230" end="00:15:41.740" style="s2">of benefit a lot of the powerful tools</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.060" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">are created because we&#39;re sharing data</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.740" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">before sharing data on what our</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:49.270" style="s2">purchases are we can create the entire</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:51.730" style="s2">chain of production when it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.270" end="00:15:53.020" style="s2">to do so it&#39;s like hey you&#39;re all buying</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.730" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">toilet paper we probably knew that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.020" end="00:15:56.050" style="s2">without some data you know what point</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">does it make sense to have our own</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.050" end="00:16:00.400" style="s2">toilet paper well what do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:03.070" style="s2">have in that function how you know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.400" end="00:16:04.510" style="s2">how many do we need like how many toilet</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.070" end="00:16:06.760" style="s2">paper factories and when does it make</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.510" end="00:16:10.029" style="s2">sense to have one in your area using our</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.760" end="00:16:11.589" style="s2">data helps us I want to say centrally</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.029" end="00:16:13.720" style="s2">planned not centrally planned it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.589" end="00:16:15.520" style="s2">dispersed planning but like we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.720" end="00:16:17.140" style="s2">putting into the system we&#39;re only gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.520" end="00:16:19.930" style="s2">put our data into the system if we gain</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.140" end="00:16:21.460" style="s2">something right away and we can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.930" end="00:16:22.990" style="s2">where it&#39;s used and hopefully we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.460" end="00:16:28.360" style="s2">pull it back if it doesn&#39;t hurt the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.990" end="00:16:30.940" style="s2">whole if we want to yeah so in the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.360" end="00:16:33.910" style="s2">conversation that we had about this you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.940" end="00:16:35.740" style="s2">did sort of talk because this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.910" end="00:16:37.510" style="s2">more the tech side but how do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.740" end="00:16:39.700" style="s2">imagine it works when you&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.510" end="00:16:41.710" style="s2">got people in real life I think you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.700" end="00:16:44.620" style="s2">that you probably have communities of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.710" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">people living together in sort of cells</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.620" end="00:16:49.810" style="s2">around the Dunbar number do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.620" end="00:16:53.410" style="s2">sort of flesh out some of those ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.810" end="00:16:55.300" style="s2">had I mean I live in community with with</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.410" end="00:16:56.950" style="s2">people and it does functionally well at</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.300" end="00:17:00.550" style="s2">the 50 or 60 people that are there</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.950" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">working with um conflict resolution and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.550" end="00:17:04.420" style="s2">whatnot but there&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:06.220" style="s2">gonna be able to find a community right</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.420" end="00:17:07.959" style="s2">now in in the world it&#39;s like we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.220" end="00:17:09.250" style="s2">and create a community and sustain like</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.959" end="00:17:11.410" style="s2">from the ground up just grow your own</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.250" end="00:17:12.250" style="s2">food and do that&#39;s not sustainable for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.410" end="00:17:15.100" style="s2">lot of people because they can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.250" end="00:17:17.530" style="s2">sign that let alone run it and so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.100" end="00:17:19.990" style="s2">idea with the Dunbar number that we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.530" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">talking about I think was that like if</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.990" end="00:17:25.510" style="s2">you can make 150 connections that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:27.339" style="s2">meaningful the old-school way which I</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.510" end="00:17:29.050" style="s2">think with the Dunbar number is is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.339" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s like a tribe that&#39;s like a group</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.050" end="00:17:33.340" style="s2">of people who all know each other they</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">know the connections they know we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.340" end="00:17:37.540" style="s2">create something that is more connected</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:39.940" style="s2">because maybe my Dunbar number is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.540" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">50 people I go to church with and 50</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.940" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">people I eat in community with and 50</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:46.269" style="s2">people I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:48.789" style="s2">tech projects with I&#39;m interconnected to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.269" end="00:17:50.139" style="s2">150 and all of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.789" end="00:17:52.269" style="s2">interconnected to their own different</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.139" end="00:17:54.309" style="s2">different groups so we have like a</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.630" end="00:22:34.150" style="s2">that conversation we can make all of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.179" end="00:22:36.410" style="s2">things better when we own them together</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.150" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">where we can&#39;t we can&#39;t make over better</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.410" end="00:22:40.970" style="s2">you know they&#39;re doing honey for a chair</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:41.929" style="s2">holders it&#39;s not there to make the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.970" end="00:22:45.290" style="s2">drivers lives better</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.929" end="00:22:48.530" style="s2">it&#39;s life better enough that we give</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.530" end="00:22:53.690" style="s2">there is there is an incentive for those</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.799" end="00:22:55.850" style="s2">companies to you know improve on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.690" end="00:22:58.669" style="s2">model and make sure there&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.850" end="00:23:00.350" style="s2">violence happening within the the cab</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.669" end="00:23:01.580" style="s2">and making sure they register the people</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:03.559" style="s2">and all those kinds of things but I</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.580" end="00:23:05.870" style="s2">guess the the the trouble that I can see</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.559" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">is just growing to the point where you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.870" end="00:23:09.350" style="s2">can compete with those things because</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">part part of the reason why Buber works</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.350" end="00:23:11.960" style="s2">so well is because it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">distributed like there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.960" end="00:23:15.890" style="s2">people who are already using the app and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:20.600" style="s2">so that gives you quite large coverage</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.890" end="00:23:23.059" style="s2">like how do you you know you can reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.600" end="00:23:24.500" style="s2">these we don&#39;t create anything until we</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.059" end="00:23:26.570" style="s2">have the threshold of people to create</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.500" end="00:23:27.980" style="s2">it with we don&#39;t create over with you</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.570" end="00:23:30.980" style="s2">and then we&#39;re like hey do you guys want</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.980" end="00:23:33.230" style="s2">over we ask we&#39;re like hey Vancouver hey</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.980" end="00:23:37.070" style="s2">Toronto hey New York how many of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.230" end="00:23:38.540" style="s2">want a cooperative ride-sharing app you</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.070" end="00:23:40.940" style="s2">know and like you&#39;re not launching anis</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.540" end="00:23:42.350" style="s2">in first of all by the time we create it</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.940" end="00:23:44.150" style="s2">it&#39;s already exists and we can launch in</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.350" end="00:23:46.970" style="s2">every city but to create it we need</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.150" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">enough riders and passengers in one city</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.970" end="00:23:51.500" style="s2">for that to be for that to be usable so</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:54.110" style="s2">what do we want it to look like I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.500" end="00:23:57.080" style="s2">that if there was a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.110" end="00:23:58.850" style="s2">ride-sharing app it would take over from</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.080" end="00:24:00.230" style="s2">uber overnight because it solves a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.850" end="00:24:01.429" style="s2">of their problems but not if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.230" end="00:24:03.260" style="s2">designed in secret</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.429" end="00:24:04.340" style="s2">not if it&#39;s designed with again four of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.260" end="00:24:07.280" style="s2">us created in going like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.340" end="00:24:09.169" style="s2">cooperative like the drivers could have</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.280" end="00:24:11.900" style="s2">a say and it just runs like every other</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.169" end="00:24:14.090" style="s2">cooperative which is awesome but run</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.900" end="00:24:17.450" style="s2">like a secret corporation run behind in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.090" end="00:24:19.160" style="s2">boardrooms behind closed doors yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.450" end="00:24:22.210" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely against the secrecy as</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.160" end="00:24:24.760" style="s2">well so</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.210" end="00:24:27.400" style="s2">you did briefly mentioned sort of Omni</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.760" end="00:24:28.870" style="s2">when and nonrival for us and those are</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.400" end="00:24:30.610" style="s2">some of the ideas that have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.870" end="00:24:32.620" style="s2">throwing or been thrown around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.610" end="00:24:36.250" style="s2">community that we are we met each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.620" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">through so do you want to explore that a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.250" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">little bit just like moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:46.570" style="s2">rival Ross dynamics and the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:49.030" style="s2">system where every new person if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.570" end="00:24:50.680" style="s2">a new driver to bur you&#39;re costing the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.030" end="00:24:53.320" style="s2">old drivers something right now they</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.680" end="00:24:54.850" style="s2">have less fares to share around I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.320" end="00:24:56.590" style="s2">know if Albert rideshare is gonna solve</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.850" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">that problem but when you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.590" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">work because your food system is created</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:00.790" style="s2">and you&#39;re like Oh more driver is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:03.070" style="s2">awesome we don&#39;t you know that just</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.790" end="00:25:04.930" style="s2">means I don&#39;t feel the need that there</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.070" end="00:25:06.790" style="s2">was 20 hours of work that people needed</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.930" end="00:25:08.620" style="s2">and now I feel like there&#39;s 15 hours of</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.790" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">work that people needed when it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.620" end="00:25:14.350" style="s2">opposite dynamic where I&#39;m not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:16.900" style="s2">not going to explain it okay that every</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.350" end="00:25:18.850" style="s2">person who comes to the table brings</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.900" end="00:25:21.460" style="s2">with them their data brings with them</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.850" end="00:25:24.160" style="s2">their their their brain brings with them</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.460" end="00:25:26.740" style="s2">their passion and their connections and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.160" end="00:25:29.890" style="s2">so every new person isn&#39;t competition</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.740" end="00:25:31.900" style="s2">their cooperation so it&#39;s designed into</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.890" end="00:25:33.910" style="s2">the system that like yes bring your data</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.900" end="00:25:35.560" style="s2">yes come on board we want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.910" end="00:25:36.850" style="s2">work we don&#39;t want to cut this off at</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.560" end="00:25:39.880" style="s2">ten thousand be like we&#39;re gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.850" end="00:25:42.040" style="s2">really awesome way for just us the more</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.880" end="00:25:44.110" style="s2">people who are there the better it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.040" end="00:25:45.610" style="s2">the more people that are to create new</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.110" end="00:25:46.930" style="s2">apps the more people that are to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.610" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">those apps the more people there are to</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.930" end="00:25:51.040" style="s2">bring their data to make it more rich</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:59.920" style="s2">and to be able to make the toilet paper</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.040" end="00:26:02.680" style="s2">factories there was also well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.920" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">we&#39;re also because I guess part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.680" end="00:26:07.630" style="s2">game be faced is to move away from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:08.860" style="s2">sort of unsustainability of the water</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.630" end="00:26:12.370" style="s2">world because at the moment we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.860" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">we&#39;re consuming too many resources just</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.370" end="00:26:20.380" style="s2">the competitive nature of capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:22.690" style="s2">pretty dangerous for all of us but how</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.380" end="00:26:25.750" style="s2">would you know if we&#39;re recreating all</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.690" end="00:26:27.430" style="s2">of these services and products how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.750" end="00:26:30.130" style="s2">how is that different from just</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.430" end="00:26:31.450" style="s2">capitalism but you know a cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.130" end="00:26:33.400" style="s2">version of that because we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.450" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2">gonna expend a lot of resources and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.400" end="00:26:37.860" style="s2">presumably more it spreads to other</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">we design or the planet I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.029" end="00:26:45.999" style="s2">designed like right now we have cell</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:47.739" style="s2">phones that are designed to be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.999" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">out in two to three years their minds</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.739" end="00:26:51.249" style="s2">their you don&#39;t like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.700" end="00:26:53.529" style="s2">designed to just switch out the screen</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.249" end="00:26:55.330" style="s2">to just or a switch out they want you to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.529" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">throw it out we don&#39;t want to throw it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.330" end="00:27:00.399" style="s2">out we have a different incentive as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">user cooperative we want a lasting</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.399" end="00:27:04.389" style="s2">product we want something and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:05.619" style="s2">and hopefully we&#39;re designing it so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.389" end="00:27:07.869" style="s2">it can be broken back down to its</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.619" end="00:27:10.629" style="s2">components and reuse we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.869" end="00:27:12.460" style="s2">mine as often as we are we&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.629" end="00:27:14.080" style="s2">it with us in mind we want something</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.460" end="00:27:16.389" style="s2">that lasts we want something that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.080" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">uses as little resources as possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.389" end="00:27:20.019" style="s2">including labor and the actual physical</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:21.549" style="s2">resources that&#39;s not what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.019" end="00:27:23.799" style="s2">incentivized to do they&#39;re incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.549" end="00:27:29.169" style="s2">to create a cheap product that will let</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.799" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">them get away with mmm yeah so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.169" end="00:27:34.629" style="s2">really kind of the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:38.169" style="s2">hopefully once once it starts building</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.629" end="00:27:40.330" style="s2">and taking off the idea is to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.169" end="00:27:43.479" style="s2">get everybody on the same page with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.330" end="00:27:46.239" style="s2">project of the co-operative and try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.479" end="00:27:47.799" style="s2">get everybody to understand some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.239" end="00:27:53.139" style="s2">issues that we need to face and the ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.799" end="00:27:55.659" style="s2">that we need to address them so just</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.139" end="00:27:57.820" style="s2">like capitalism we&#39;re all acting in our</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.659" end="00:27:59.470" style="s2">own best interests and somehow magically</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.820" end="00:28:01.359" style="s2">that makes is supposed to make a better</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.470" end="00:28:02.679" style="s2">world but it also makes a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.359" end="00:28:04.499" style="s2">destructive world where we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.679" end="00:28:07.359" style="s2">competition with each other and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.499" end="00:28:08.739" style="s2">incentivize sociopaths and people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.359" end="00:28:11.169" style="s2">want to game the system for their own</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.739" end="00:28:13.119" style="s2">benefit we can create in the way where</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.169" end="00:28:14.409" style="s2">you still get a say in what you want if</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.119" end="00:28:15.820" style="s2">you want a different cellphone if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.409" end="00:28:17.470" style="s2">want a blackberry if you want you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.820" end="00:28:19.659" style="s2">mean whatever functions are for yours</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.470" end="00:28:21.580" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t know you don&#39;t get like</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.659" end="00:28:23.349" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a cost to that if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.580" end="00:28:26.379" style="s2">have your own individual no one else</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.349" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">wants it yours is gonna cost more either</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.379" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">in money or labor and something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:32.409" style="s2">we&#39;ve used as an unit of exchange but</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.789" end="00:28:35.409" style="s2">there&#39;s going to also be an incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.409" end="00:28:37.869" style="s2">have one right like so they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.409" end="00:28:40.929" style="s2">be one that is very universal and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.869" end="00:28:42.909" style="s2">niche ones but together we want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.929" end="00:28:46.359" style="s2">create a system and a company that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.909" end="00:28:49.309" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cannibalize off itself right</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.359" end="00:28:51.889" style="s2">like if you want to come in and create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.309" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">competing to telephone company or</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.889" end="00:28:56.749" style="s2">competing toilet paper factory why like</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:58.429" style="s2">why would you want to do that unless</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.749" end="00:29:00.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s meeting a need that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.429" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">have right like if we have white toilet</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.710" end="00:29:06.620" style="s2">paper and you want blue toilet paper why</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:08.389" style="s2">I don&#39;t know but like then come and help</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.620" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">us create blue toilet paper you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.389" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">like we don&#39;t need to have you create</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">your own system and your own delivery</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:16.490" style="s2">system like the point is is if what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:17.899" style="s2">are creating isn&#39;t meeting your</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.490" end="00:29:20.409" style="s2">individual needs</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.899" end="00:29:22.700" style="s2">come help us meet your individual needs</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.409" end="00:29:24.529" style="s2">without you needing to go and recreate</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.700" end="00:29:26.600" style="s2">the system again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.529" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">which is what capitalism does so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.600" end="00:29:30.230" style="s2">competes so we get the best price in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:31.669" style="s2">market but there&#39;s so much inefficiency</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.230" end="00:29:33.559" style="s2">there but they&#39;re all kind of lysing off</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.669" end="00:29:35.119" style="s2">each other they&#39;re all like it just</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.559" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and it&#39;s destroying our</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.119" end="00:29:38.299" style="s2">planet there are just incentivize to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:41.690" style="s2">cell phones to throw away so they can</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.349" end="00:31:53.099" style="s2">level that we would assume is cured</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.179" end="00:31:55.080" style="s2">considering today&#39;s standards and I say</p>

<p begin="00:32:02.999" end="00:32:09.389" style="s2">collectively unleash yeah because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.359" end="00:32:10.710" style="s2">guess one of the problems within the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.389" end="00:32:12.570" style="s2">scientific community is they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.710" end="00:32:14.340" style="s2">incentivize to never solve the problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.570" end="00:32:15.929" style="s2">because once they&#39;ve solved the problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.340" end="00:32:17.879" style="s2">that our funding anymore and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.929" end="00:32:21.149" style="s2">what you specialize them so but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.879" end="00:32:25.950" style="s2">incentives are all wrong yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.149" end="00:32:27.989" style="s2">yeah money as an incentive breaks</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.950" end="00:32:29.879" style="s2">everything if you&#39;re playing a sport</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.989" end="00:32:31.409" style="s2">because you&#39;re making money you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.879" end="00:32:33.450" style="s2">playing to be the best of your sport if</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.409" end="00:32:34.950" style="s2">you are million people because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.450" end="00:32:37.019" style="s2">making money you&#39;re not playing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.950" end="00:32:39.419" style="s2">not playing you know medicine in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.019" end="00:32:41.129" style="s2">to get better at science if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.419" end="00:32:43.049" style="s2">that is if you&#39;re doing science in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.129" end="00:32:44.489" style="s2">to get the next grants you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.049" end="00:32:46.409" style="s2">it to get that Eureka moment which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.489" end="00:32:48.929" style="s2">what we want scientists to get to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.409" end="00:32:50.669" style="s2">what would make it better for you is</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.929" end="00:32:52.679" style="s2">only money because what money represents</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.669" end="00:32:55.019" style="s2">on our planet when people have all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.679" end="00:32:57.269" style="s2">their needs met they choose to put their</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.019" end="00:32:59.639" style="s2">labor and put their genius and passion</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.269" end="00:33:02.129" style="s2">where they want to and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.639" end="00:33:04.099" style="s2">want people doing it well I think some</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.129" end="00:33:06.570" style="s2">people I think some people are just</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.099" end="00:33:08.940" style="s2">motivated by money and I think you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.570" end="00:33:12.359" style="s2">need money or some kind of currency to</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.940" end="00:33:13.830" style="s2">transact in the system anyway and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.359" end="00:33:14.490" style="s2">think money is actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.830" end="00:33:16.920" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.490" end="00:33:19.410" style="s2">to look at in terms of how we change the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.920" end="00:33:21.090" style="s2">incentives of the system because if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.410" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">change how money works you change how</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.090" end="00:33:24.660" style="s2">people behave because at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:27.059" style="s2">money is a scarce resource so everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.660" end="00:33:30.300" style="s2">sort of competing for it in a non zero</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.059" end="00:33:34.350" style="s2">in a zero-sum fashion but there are some</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.300" end="00:33:37.650" style="s2">ideas out like the adjustable universal</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.350" end="00:33:40.380" style="s2">basic income which alex Howlett tools</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.650" end="00:33:42.360" style="s2">talking about we are basically the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.380" end="00:33:43.860" style="s2">government prints as much money as they</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.360" end="00:33:47.130" style="s2">need to in order to make sure that these</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.860" end="00:33:49.500" style="s2">people money for people to spend so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.130" end="00:33:51.030" style="s2">less competitive for just getting money</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.500" end="00:33:53.010" style="s2">in the first place because so long as</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.030" end="00:33:55.800" style="s2">people have money to spend the economy</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.010" end="00:33:57.150" style="s2">can keep taking over so and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.800" end="00:33:58.410" style="s2">people have mentioned hollow chain to</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.150" end="00:34:01.290" style="s2">you of a few a few times</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.410" end="00:34:02.760" style="s2">so those some of the technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.290" end="00:34:06.059" style="s2">might be implemented in the system just</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.760" end="00:34:08.340" style="s2">to give people something to show that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.059" end="00:34:11.250" style="s2">they have value for this and then there</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.340" end="00:34:13.409" style="s2">would be I think again incentivizing for</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.250" end="00:34:15.389" style="s2">like even technology if you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.409" end="00:34:16.980" style="s2">technology to make profit you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.389" end="00:34:20.010" style="s2">creating the best technology you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.980" end="00:34:21.210" style="s2">creating to innovate however there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.010" end="00:34:22.859" style="s2">this certain we live in a world that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.210" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">needs money and so if what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.859" end="00:34:26.810" style="s2">incentivize the masses is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:29.190" style="s2">currency we will create a currency</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.810" end="00:34:31.619" style="s2">together or though right it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.190" end="00:34:32.909" style="s2">to be one of the crypto currencies</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.619" end="00:34:37.710" style="s2">that&#39;s already out there how many are</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.909" end="00:34:39.780" style="s2">there now that was intenta one of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.710" end="00:34:41.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t mad our new American dollar but a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.780" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">million of us a billion of us being like</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.820" end="00:34:46.260" style="s2">hey what are the features the best</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:48.270" style="s2">crypto currencies and what how are they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.260" end="00:34:49.740" style="s2">created how do we create ours I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.270" end="00:34:51.540" style="s2">think common planet has a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.740" end="00:34:54.090" style="s2">idea for how to create a currency and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.540" end="00:34:56.429" style="s2">maybe we would cream that like where</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.090" end="00:34:58.890" style="s2">you&#39;re creating it by doing the labor</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.429" end="00:35:02.060" style="s2">and get it once you spend it nobody gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.890" end="00:35:06.180" style="s2">it and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a non</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.060" end="00:35:08.150" style="s2">recycle it&#39;s a nun you use it up so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.180" end="00:35:11.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go yeah so it doesn&#39;t accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.150" end="00:35:17.400" style="s2">yes similar to what our Renzi was</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.970" end="00:35:19.260" style="s2">talking about was that project yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.400" end="00:35:22.320" style="s2">yeah I thought that was a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:24.920" style="s2">idea really really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:24.920" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.079" end="00:35:30.529" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with but like I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.579" end="00:35:31.700" style="s2">absolutely do that over what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.529" end="00:35:33.799" style="s2">currently doing and I feel thing about</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.700" end="00:35:36.349" style="s2">basically everyone&#39;s idea moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.799" end="00:35:38.660" style="s2">I&#39;m like two ice Nazi I see some holes</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.349" end="00:35:40.789" style="s2">in it I&#39;m sure like people see mine and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.660" end="00:35:43.969" style="s2">also infinitely better than what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.789" end="00:35:46.339" style="s2">currently have yeah well yeah well the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.969" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">purpose is to just get to a better place</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.339" end="00:35:51.109" style="s2">because the thing is we live in very</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:53.509" style="s2">wealthy countries and we have all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.109" end="00:35:55.910" style="s2">these technologies and all of this all</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.509" end="00:35:59.450" style="s2">of these reasons or says but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.910" end="00:36:02.059" style="s2">unhappy place to be and it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.450" end="00:36:05.180" style="s2">just seems insane and in so many ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.059" end="00:36:06.650" style="s2">because you know eating up our resources</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.180" end="00:36:11.869" style="s2">and creating all of this cultural</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.650" end="00:36:15.079" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s just yes no no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.869" end="00:36:18.499" style="s2">really disconnected like even really</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.079" end="00:36:19.789" style="s2">rich people are unhappy yes some of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.499" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">most happy people are probably those</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.789" end="00:36:25.309" style="s2">that aren&#39;t rich and don&#39;t get their</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">value from from having currency we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.309" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">create a better world by constantly</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:34.940" style="s2">asking what would help you yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:37.130" style="s2">would help you live a better life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.940" end="00:36:39.079" style="s2">because at the moment I think the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.130" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">is kind of just a giant casino because</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.079" end="00:36:44.229" style="s2">everyone&#39;s trying to do whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:47.630" style="s2">that maximizes their short-term pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.229" end="00:36:49.819" style="s2">and that just doesn&#39;t make you happy</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.630" end="00:36:52.190" style="s2">like the things that make people happy</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.819" end="00:36:54.349" style="s2">are having community happy having their</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.190" end="00:36:56.749" style="s2">loved ones around them having a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.349" end="00:36:57.890" style="s2">purpose and things like that and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.749" end="00:37:03.170" style="s2">model that we&#39;re working with at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.890" end="00:37:04.549" style="s2">moment just doesn&#39;t do that actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.170" end="00:37:07.190" style="s2">community is a takeaway from my</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.549" end="00:37:09.079" style="s2">connection in anything it adds to it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.190" end="00:37:10.459" style="s2">know you having a food doesn&#39;t take away</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.079" end="00:37:12.410" style="s2">for mine unless there&#39;s only a finite</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.459" end="00:37:14.359" style="s2">amount of food and we can create enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.410" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">food no problem right now on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.359" end="00:37:19.999" style="s2">we create enough food yeah but we saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:22.609" style="s2">our yeah we you know we we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.999" end="00:37:24.859" style="s2">land to grow communities and shelter on</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.609" end="00:37:26.150" style="s2">as long as people aren&#39;t having 15</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.859" end="00:37:29.449" style="s2">houses that they&#39;re not even rent you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.150" end="00:37:32.029" style="s2">know like we have enough we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.449" end="00:37:34.459" style="s2">have a way to get it to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.029" end="00:37:36.559" style="s2">the previous solution to that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.459" end="00:37:39.019" style="s2">communism and it clearly was about a</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.559" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">solution to that but we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.019" end="00:37:42.710" style="s2">solution to that because it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:44.420" style="s2">we&#39;re not central planning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.710" end="00:37:45.830" style="s2">literally using data on a plan and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.420" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">looking at like what&#39;s going wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.830" end="00:37:49.820" style="s2">recreating it to like we&#39;re not ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:51.410" style="s2">that things could go wrong we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.820" end="00:37:53.270" style="s2">for things to go wrong and fixing them</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.410" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">and then new things will go wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.270" end="00:37:56.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll fix that we never get to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:37:58.250" style="s2">perfection we&#39;re just always looking for</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.270" end="00:38:01.610" style="s2">what is the next iteration that makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.250" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">this better and we also really suck at</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.610" end="00:38:05.540" style="s2">handing back power once we have it so</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">we&#39;re never gonna centralize power we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.540" end="00:38:09.770" style="s2">just gonna as much as possible I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:12.290" style="s2">be like right this is a tech company and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.770" end="00:38:13.940" style="s2">only a tech company so even if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.290" end="00:38:16.070" style="s2">board of directors has some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.940" end="00:38:17.860" style="s2">power which I&#39;ve just in my head</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.070" end="00:38:20.300" style="s2">designed to be as little as possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.860" end="00:38:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s still only a tech company it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.300" end="00:38:24.080" style="s2">making laws for you to follow</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.100" end="00:38:25.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like want to use this service is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.080" end="00:38:27.980" style="s2">not working for you how can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.460" end="00:38:29.840" style="s2">better not like you must use it you must</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.980" end="00:38:31.840" style="s2">give us your data unless we collectively</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.840" end="00:38:33.650" style="s2">somehow decide something is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.840" end="00:38:35.870" style="s2">fundamentally important we need your</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.650" end="00:38:37.220" style="s2">data on it but you get a say in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.870" end="00:38:39.860" style="s2">and even then I will fight against that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.220" end="00:38:42.500" style="s2">even if I want to give my dad I want it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.860" end="00:38:45.170" style="s2">to be voluntary every single time yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.500" end="00:38:46.910" style="s2">well about that that was one of my key</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.170" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">questions is avoiding power</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.910" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">centralization because you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:51.890" style="s2">always start off with the best of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:54.770" style="s2">intentions but once people see an</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.890" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">opportunity to exploit a system often</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.770" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">those people will find their way into</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:00.350" style="s2">the halls of power and then they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:02.420" style="s2">start you know centralizing things and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.350" end="00:39:04.490" style="s2">then that&#39;s really why communism failed</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.420" end="00:39:06.050" style="s2">is because you know that the idea was to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.490" end="00:39:07.700" style="s2">screen everything out that you you had</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.050" end="00:39:10.730" style="s2">this pool of people who were in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.700" end="00:39:12.710" style="s2">middle and they forced everyone out and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.730" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">they took advantage of that situation so</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.710" end="00:39:17.330" style="s2">have you have you thought much about how</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:17.720" style="s2">you would you know stop that from</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.330" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.720" end="00:39:26.990" style="s2">well you see there&#39;s gonna be a board of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.990" end="00:39:28.820" style="s2">directors are they gonna be permanent</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.990" end="00:39:31.250" style="s2">permanently fixed in those positions or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.820" end="00:39:33.290" style="s2">is it gonna be a rotating it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.250" end="00:39:35.660" style="s2">how I envisioned it being and it might</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.290" end="00:39:38.900" style="s2">need to be a longer time period between</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.660" end="00:39:40.280" style="s2">elections but every year the talk the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.900" end="00:39:42.440" style="s2">people with the top delegated votes</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.280" end="00:39:44.540" style="s2">becomes the board of directors and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.440" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">work together so let&#39;s say yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.540" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">even know how many board of directors we</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:50.900" style="s2">need but I&#39;m gonna say five maybe ten so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:53.180" style="s2">it&#39;s intense it&#39;s a fun number there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.900" end="00:39:54.650" style="s2">Ted Kord of directors so</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.180" end="00:39:56.089" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean they have equals say</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.650" end="00:39:57.770" style="s2">around that table because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.089" end="00:40:00.700" style="s2">delegating our vote to them based on</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.770" end="00:40:03.559" style="s2">like with democracy so if at any end its</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.700" end="00:40:05.210" style="s2">streams lives you&#39;re able to see what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.559" end="00:40:06.529" style="s2">going on you don&#39;t have to watch it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.210" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">who wants to watch that but enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.529" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">people will be watching and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:11.990" style="s2">transfer your vote so if you imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">the president did something to piss off</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.990" end="00:40:15.529" style="s2">50% of the population it just moved and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:17.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a new president like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.529" end="00:40:18.710" style="s2">you could have someone at that table has</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.299" end="00:40:20.569" style="s2">99 percent of the vote and you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.710" end="00:40:21.740" style="s2">someone who got elected and now is zero</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.569" end="00:40:25.069" style="s2">percent of the vote they&#39;re just getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.740" end="00:40:26.630" style="s2">paid for that year ya get reelected next</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.069" end="00:40:27.980" style="s2">year but so what</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.630" end="00:40:29.299" style="s2">they&#39;re you know they&#39;re there to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.980" end="00:40:30.950" style="s2">devil&#39;s advocate they&#39;re there to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.299" end="00:40:34.190" style="s2">something to be like always the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.950" end="00:40:36.339" style="s2">dissenting vote the issue would be if</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.190" end="00:40:39.170" style="s2">all of those people work together and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.339" end="00:40:40.369" style="s2">together they&#39;re deciding on shitty</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.170" end="00:40:42.440" style="s2">things right and then like what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.369" end="00:40:44.569" style="s2">can&#39;t transfer your vote to anyone so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.440" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">have a recall for election when we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.569" end="00:40:48.099" style="s2">that&#39;s happening it&#39;s like enough of us</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">just pull out our power and be like ah</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.099" end="00:40:52.789" style="s2">re-election right we don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:54.289" style="s2">that too often but if that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.789" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">happening and they&#39;re now buddy-buddy</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.289" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">and they&#39;re working in cohesion against</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:00.380" style="s2">us yeah other is they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.869" style="s2">worried and we&#39;re only empowering a</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.380" end="00:41:04.309" style="s2">group of people if we need to if we need</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.869" end="00:41:06.859" style="s2">a smaller group of people to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.309" end="00:41:08.900" style="s2">meet and move a company forward let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.859" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">it if it&#39;s gonna make better products</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.900" end="00:41:12.349" style="s2">and make us get to where we&#39;re going but</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.910" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">again they&#39;re not deciding on who we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.349" end="00:41:16.220" style="s2">to marry they don&#39;t deciding what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:18.140" style="s2">legal and illegal they&#39;re just like hey</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:23.420" style="s2">to fund we are deciding on which</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.109" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">projects to fund it&#39;s lit I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.420" end="00:41:28.970" style="s2">know what they do because I&#39;m not a like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">how do we move this forward to be great</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.970" end="00:41:33.410" style="s2">to have that now to create the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:35.779" style="s2">and create you know the labor platform</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.410" end="00:41:38.470" style="s2">create something to say how do we fund</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.779" end="00:41:40.670" style="s2">it what is illegal what&#39;s what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.470" end="00:41:43.970" style="s2">what what do we need to know legally</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.670" end="00:41:45.829" style="s2">what do we need you know pretty much to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.970" end="00:41:47.390" style="s2">do the work that they expect one</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.829" end="00:41:48.770" style="s2">entrepreneur to do and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.390" end="00:41:50.109" style="s2">happening because I don&#39;t want to be an</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.770" end="00:41:52.099" style="s2">entrepreneur I want to be in a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.109" end="00:41:54.250" style="s2">yeah yeah fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.099" end="00:41:57.049" style="s2">well hopefully you&#39;ve got enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.250" end="00:41:58.510" style="s2">entrepreneurial Ness about yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.049" end="00:42:02.029" style="s2">actually get this thing started because</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.510" end="00:42:03.799" style="s2">yeah that meant I was thinking while you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.029" end="00:42:06.410" style="s2">were saying that maybe it&#39;s worth coming</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.799" end="00:42:08.060" style="s2">up with like a constitution of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.410" end="00:42:10.100" style="s2">the cooperative so this kind of some</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.060" end="00:42:11.750" style="s2">fundamental things that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.100" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">agreeing on when we when we&#39;re buying</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.750" end="00:42:17.480" style="s2">into this so that we can try to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:20.900" style="s2">some of those you know conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.480" end="00:42:22.490" style="s2">changes of policy because yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.900" end="00:42:25.010" style="s2">people people can change the rules</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.490" end="00:42:26.810" style="s2">partway through if they have the power</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:28.070" style="s2">to change those rules so if there was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.810" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">constitutional would be a bit more solid</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.070" end="00:42:33.140" style="s2">and just a few fundamental things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:35.540" style="s2">usually you couldn&#39;t pull those labels</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.140" end="00:42:37.850" style="s2">livers because we&#39;ve all agreed that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.540" end="00:42:39.410" style="s2">will absolutely have that I&#39;m not going</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.850" end="00:42:41.630" style="s2">to create that both because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.410" end="00:42:43.940" style="s2">right back writing that out sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.630" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">horrible to me also I want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.940" end="00:42:47.090" style="s2">the conversations that create that right</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">I want to be able to be like what are</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.090" end="00:42:51.500" style="s2">our values what are the things we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.270" style="s2">to that Constitution what do we do with</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.500" end="00:42:55.400" style="s2">sociopaths what do we do with people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.270" end="00:42:58.340" style="s2">game the system and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.400" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">if we literally just create it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.340" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">where they&#39;re not incentivized to work</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">for theirselves in isolation where they</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:07.220" style="s2">get to amass a bunch of power and money</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:09.200" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve already had that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.220" end="00:43:10.340" style="s2">and we&#39;re two people right imagine if</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.200" end="00:43:12.680" style="s2">there&#39;s 10,000 of us having that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.340" end="00:43:16.390" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re not silent people not</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.680" end="00:43:19.100" style="s2">being like that&#39;s never gonna happen Shh</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.390" end="00:43:20.570" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna do that it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.100" end="00:43:22.820" style="s2">there&#39;s sociopaths what do we do about</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.570" end="00:43:24.380" style="s2">that yeah and people are just shitty in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.820" end="00:43:26.420" style="s2">general like if people can get an</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.380" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">advantage over other people then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.420" end="00:43:31.160" style="s2">typically what they do and most people</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:33.410" style="s2">don&#39;t really investigate their beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.160" end="00:43:35.720" style="s2">or the way that they interact they just</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.410" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">kind of go from situation to situation</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.720" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">and they just do whatever kind of feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.860" style="s2">right to them which typically doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:45.130" style="s2">have much consideration for the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.860" end="00:43:47.870" style="s2">that they&#39;re coming into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.130" end="00:43:49.730" style="s2">yeah well I mean I like the sound of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.870" end="00:43:52.940" style="s2">these ideas I&#39;m interested in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.730" end="00:43:54.320" style="s2">being part of the group of collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.940" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">people who are trying to solve these</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.320" end="00:44:00.020" style="s2">problems and hopefully participate in</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:02.150" style="s2">the ways that I can participate to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.020" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">because with the community that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.150" end="00:44:05.810" style="s2">both apart of there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:08.660" style="s2">ideas out there so what I&#39;m hoping is</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.810" end="00:44:10.660" style="s2">that we all sort of coalesce in a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.660" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">of different areas and we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.660" end="00:44:18.280" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:19.910" style="s2">yeah so I think I really like on</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.280" end="00:44:23.089" style="s2">bringing</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.910" end="00:44:25.279" style="s2">what is the essence of the idea cafe -</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.089" end="00:44:27.230" style="s2">game be like I think that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.279" end="00:44:28.430" style="s2">best things I have to offer is like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.230" end="00:44:30.680" style="s2">thought of how we have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.430" end="00:44:33.410" style="s2">with hundreds and thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.680" end="00:44:35.029" style="s2">it&#39;s not any way because any way that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.410" end="00:44:37.910" style="s2">happens is in my head and not on paper</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.029" end="00:44:39.230" style="s2">so until we&#39;re using it oh crap that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.910" end="00:44:40.849" style="s2">wrong how do we improve it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.230" end="00:44:42.710" style="s2">improve that right that&#39;s why I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.849" end="00:44:44.390" style="s2">putting in because I don&#39;t have it but</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.710" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">I&#39;m not playing in tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.390" end="00:44:48.259" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of dollars</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:50.869" style="s2">to create the idea cafe before we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.259" end="00:44:53.630" style="s2">held idea cafes we want to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.869" end="00:44:55.490" style="s2">the issues are and know how to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.630" end="00:44:57.140" style="s2">World Cafe online which is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.490" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">modeled after if anyone wants to look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.140" end="00:45:02.779" style="s2">World Cafe I&#39;m not gonna actually like</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:04.910" style="s2">it right now but creating like to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.779" end="00:45:06.470" style="s2">able to have our game be conversations</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.910" end="00:45:08.569" style="s2">which are people all over the globe</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.470" end="00:45:10.369" style="s2">wanting to have a say and like hey hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.569" end="00:45:12.140" style="s2">how what are the questions we want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.369" end="00:45:14.150" style="s2">answer together how do we have those</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.140" end="00:45:15.410" style="s2">conversations how do we get people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.150" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">the table and have an effective</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.410" end="00:45:18.740" style="s2">conversation with hundreds of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:20.359" style="s2">I think it&#39;s breaking off into smaller</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:22.099" style="s2">groups and also keep having</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.359" end="00:45:24.529" style="s2">conversations repeatedly with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.099" end="00:45:27.170" style="s2">people as often as possible in a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.529" end="00:45:30.380" style="s2">that works which i think is what i</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.170" end="00:45:32.839" style="s2">proposed is six different time slots</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.380" end="00:45:34.460" style="s2">throughout the day so that one of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.839" end="00:45:36.109" style="s2">works for you there every four hours so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.460" end="00:45:37.700" style="s2">one of them works for you and one or two</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.109" end="00:45:39.710" style="s2">of them are horrible you&#39;ll never come</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.700" end="00:45:42.829" style="s2">to them I&#39;m never coming to the 2:00</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.710" end="00:45:45.170" style="s2">a.m. one in my time zone unless I could</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.829" end="00:45:46.940" style="s2">be awake at that time period yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.170" end="00:45:51.650" style="s2">can&#39;t get to sleep just have a have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.940" end="00:45:55.250" style="s2">interesting conversation that&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.650" end="00:45:56.809" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m hopeful for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.250" end="00:45:59.809" style="s2">development of this and I guess this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.809" end="00:46:04.519" style="s2">sort of the first part of it so early</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.809" end="00:46:07.160" style="s2">early days but yeah this helps like have</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.519" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">you coming and having a conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.160" end="00:46:11.150" style="s2">having someone ask questions and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:14.029" style="s2">explaining them as opposed to me needing</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.150" end="00:46:15.740" style="s2">to like in the back of my mind think of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.029" end="00:46:17.180" style="s2">all of those questions and just spew</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.740" end="00:46:18.950" style="s2">them all out without finishing one and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.180" end="00:46:24.079" style="s2">it start you know name it like it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.950" end="00:46:26.180" style="s2">helps by ATD brain explain it yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.079" end="00:46:27.940" style="s2">think it is true to some extent that</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.180" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">people think through conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.940" end="00:46:32.119" style="s2">yeah I think that this is thus a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.140" end="00:46:34.990" style="s2">way to go but I mean I&#39;m not much man</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.119" end="00:46:34.990" style="s2">interviewer obvious</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.770" end="00:46:39.890" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s like ask you two</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:41.600" style="s2">questions and answering and then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.890" end="00:46:43.130" style="s2">know generates a new question that might</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.600" end="00:46:46.790" style="s2">not be one that&#39;s written down and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.130" end="00:46:48.290" style="s2">you know it sparks that I know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.790" end="00:46:51.230" style="s2">write this all down in a coherent way</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.290" end="00:46:55.130" style="s2">and I can answer questions on it all day</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.230" end="00:46:56.600" style="s2">every day it&#39;s like alright that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.130" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do I&#39;m just gonna figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.600" end="00:47:01.610" style="s2">and that is if we create the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:04.310" style="s2">conversational platform for game B using</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.610" end="00:47:05.210" style="s2">zoom using existing technology I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.310" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">come and be part of those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.210" end="00:47:09.770" style="s2">and maybe the global cooperative never</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:12.170" style="s2">happens but pieces of it we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.770" end="00:47:13.580" style="s2">it right like it&#39;s about like okay if we</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.170" end="00:47:15.170" style="s2">create something better together I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.580" end="00:47:16.370" style="s2">holding strongly on to this one but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.170" end="00:47:18.650" style="s2">bringing democracy I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.370" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">transparency I&#39;m bringing like the power</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.650" end="00:47:23.120" style="s2">of tech that we all own together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:25.790" style="s2">showing up as unique individual and not</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.120" end="00:47:27.410" style="s2">having to like I don&#39;t know give</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.790" end="00:47:28.910" style="s2">ourselves over to the group I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.410" end="00:47:30.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of cost that comes with</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.910" end="00:47:33.440" style="s2">that and those trade-offs have existed</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.740" end="00:47:34.940" style="s2">before we have the technology we no</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:36.230" style="s2">longer need those trade offs you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.940" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">need to give yourself up to the group</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.230" end="00:47:42.170" style="s2">because there&#39;s a group out there that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:44.090" style="s2">will accept you for you I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.170" end="00:47:46.220" style="s2">everyone&#39;s got a lot of value within</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.090" end="00:47:49.190" style="s2">them somewhere they just need to find a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.220" end="00:47:50.840" style="s2">way to unlock it hopefully we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.190" end="00:47:52.850" style="s2">that out and yeah obviously there&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.840" end="00:47:55.490" style="s2">a lot of things that we&#39;re gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.850" end="00:47:57.380" style="s2">across in order to solve but you know if</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.490" end="00:47:58.670" style="s2">you get people who are passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.380" end="00:48:02.150" style="s2">something you can bring them all</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.670" end="00:48:05.240" style="s2">together and they&#39;ll figure it out no</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.150" end="00:48:08.690" style="s2">crowd sourcing solutions is a good way</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.240" end="00:48:11.270" style="s2">to go they&#39;re not gatekeeping but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.690" end="00:48:13.550" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a lot of trouble with you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.270" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">know coordination and cooperation just</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.550" end="00:48:17.690" style="s2">because a lot of people are gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:19.070" style="s2">conflicting ideas and maybe they can</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.690" end="00:48:20.900" style="s2">just like work on separate things</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.070" end="00:48:23.870" style="s2">hopefully we there&#39;s an efficiency that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.900" end="00:48:25.580" style="s2">we can figure out yeah yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.870" end="00:48:27.650" style="s2">think what I&#39;m proposing is not the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.580" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">but but like it&#39;s a foundation of Ka&#39;bah</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.650" end="00:48:31.940" style="s2">I&#39;m having like a conversation every</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:34.340" style="s2">four hours it&#39;s in the car but you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.940" end="00:48:35.780" style="s2">zoom coffee shop then you can just show</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.340" end="00:48:37.310" style="s2">up you know when people will be in there</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.780" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of dissipated aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.310" end="00:48:41.360" style="s2">really people in there nobody know they</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:42.500" style="s2">can show up and then I would like it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.360" end="00:48:44.930" style="s2">be around a question because I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.500" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">that therefore I don&#39;t feel I have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.930" end="00:48:47.640" style="s2">meet everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:50.220" style="s2">the one right I don&#39;t have to get to air</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.640" end="00:48:51.780" style="s2">all six conversations I only have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.220" end="00:48:53.490" style="s2">show up to one or two because I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.780" end="00:48:56.340" style="s2">gonna be part of a few conversations in</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.490" end="00:48:57.750" style="s2">smaller groups and then how I envisioned</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.340" end="00:49:00.210" style="s2">it and how I proposed it is that we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.750" end="00:49:02.010" style="s2">like Monday Tuesday there&#39;s one question</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:03.540" style="s2">and so come on at ones time period</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.010" end="00:49:06.090" style="s2">during that day you have 48 hours to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.540" end="00:49:08.370" style="s2">answer the question then on on Wednesday</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.090" end="00:49:09.690" style="s2">we harvest that conversation anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.370" end="00:49:11.190" style="s2">was part of it can come on and one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:13.350" style="s2">the one of the time periods and say how</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.190" end="00:49:15.330" style="s2">that was for you what was generated what</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.350" end="00:49:18.090" style="s2">came out of it how do we actually use</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.330" end="00:49:19.350" style="s2">that information and maybe that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.090" end="00:49:20.610" style="s2">work for the first few questions because</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.350" end="00:49:22.200" style="s2">we&#39;re more Debian to know each other and</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.610" end="00:49:24.090" style="s2">getting since figure out like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.200" end="00:49:25.710" style="s2">doing and what it is and then we repeat</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.090" end="00:49:27.930" style="s2">that process in the next three days and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.710" end="00:49:29.730" style="s2">the seventh day we rest no the seventh</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.930" end="00:49:31.110" style="s2">day we generate questions of like how do</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.730" end="00:49:33.030" style="s2">we move this forward the next week right</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.110" end="00:49:34.860" style="s2">what are questions they would we want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.030" end="00:49:38.190" style="s2">show up an answer that would be powerful</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.860" end="00:49:39.720" style="s2">to get into together and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.190" end="00:49:42.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a way to have a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.720" end="00:49:45.720" style="s2">a large group of people globally right</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.510" end="00:49:47.070" style="s2">and then eventually projects come out of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.720" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">it and we break off into smaller groups</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.070" end="00:49:52.260" style="s2">if we want to a need to write like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">idea is to is to just have fun playing</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.260" end="00:49:55.410" style="s2">with game being like get to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:57.690" style="s2">like what it is what could it be what</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.410" end="00:49:59.580" style="s2">has it been but you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.690" end="00:50:02.670" style="s2">like just having conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.580" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">everyone is invited to who game beatriz</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.670" end="00:50:06.210" style="s2">in but nobody&#39;s in hierarchy because if</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:08.190" style="s2">you don&#39;t get a show up to the table and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.210" end="00:50:12.300" style="s2">even me and be like I got all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.190" end="00:50:15.510" style="s2">answers but I still only gonna take up a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.300" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">quarter of the time and I mean offer my</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.510" end="00:50:20.220" style="s2">solution to that topics question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:22.230" style="s2">it I don&#39;t get to say this is mine and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.220" end="00:50:24.090" style="s2">it has to be my way and neither does</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.230" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">anyone else even if they are first to</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.090" end="00:50:29.340" style="s2">you know get into game B every note and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:32.070" style="s2">it is like sit at the table tell yours</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.340" end="00:50:33.150" style="s2">tell your story tell your ideas yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.070" end="00:50:34.830" style="s2">often these things have sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.150" end="00:50:37.950" style="s2">organic structure to them anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.830" end="00:50:39.990" style="s2">maybe just putting your ideas out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.950" end="00:50:41.490" style="s2">is what sparks something in somebody</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.990" end="00:50:43.470" style="s2">else and then that the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.490" end="00:50:45.090" style="s2">domino effect rolls on and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.470" end="00:50:47.190" style="s2">eventually you know something gets done</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.090" end="00:50:48.540" style="s2">and it looks you know either very</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.190" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">similar to what you were envisioning or</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.540" end="00:50:51.900" style="s2">quite different still does the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:56.760" style="s2">thing that you were hoping it today but</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.900" end="00:50:58.380" style="s2">yes always I think even me I&#39;m the only</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.760" end="00:50:58.750" style="s2">one working on and every time I put it</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.380" end="00:51:00.250" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.750" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">I&#39;m like that didn&#39;t work and then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.250" end="00:51:02.050" style="s2">have to put it out there again in a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:04.450" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.050" end="00:51:06.040" style="s2">beautiful is every time I can&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.450" end="00:51:08.200" style="s2">until there&#39;s like we&#39;re doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.040" end="00:51:11.710" style="s2">game be it it&#39;s like oh yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.200" end="00:51:13.390" style="s2">the whole point is one person you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.710" end="00:51:15.580" style="s2">never like even if you&#39;re the smartest</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.390" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">person in the world you sitting at a</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.580" end="00:51:19.480" style="s2">table with three other coverage people</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.320" end="00:51:22.350" style="s2">is gonna be smarter than just you</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.480" end="00:51:24.970" style="s2">because before they&#39;re like I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.350" end="00:51:26.770" style="s2">we&#39;re just better together as long as</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.970" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s some amount of cohesion and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.770" end="00:51:33.690" style="s2">we&#39;re not spending all of our time on</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:37.120" style="s2">conflict resolution yeah yeah well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.690" end="00:51:38.560" style="s2">sort of into the rib wisdom space at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.120" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">moment and they&#39;re really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.560" end="00:51:41.980" style="s2">this collective intelligence idea so</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.210" end="00:51:44.520" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to come up with psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.980" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">technologies to you know facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.520" end="00:51:51.400" style="s2">conversations that can kind of solve</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:53.080" style="s2">problems and generate new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.400" end="00:51:54.580" style="s2">information and things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.080" end="00:51:57.070" style="s2">hopefully something interesting comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.580" end="00:51:58.600" style="s2">over there it sounds a little bit do</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.070" end="00:52:00.310" style="s2">they have anything do they have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.600" end="00:52:02.170" style="s2">on how to actually do that besides as</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.310" end="00:52:05.350" style="s2">someone had said on the Twitter which</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.170" end="00:52:07.210" style="s2">was like I don&#39;t know I I was like our</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.350" end="00:52:08.200" style="s2">robots vody and I&#39;m very confused just</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.210" end="00:52:09.700" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about like no not</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.200" end="00:52:11.320" style="s2">robots for what do you more like</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.700" end="00:52:12.520" style="s2">correlating our information I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.320" end="00:52:14.170" style="s2">okay I&#39;m okay with that but not if</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.520" end="00:52:15.580" style="s2">they&#39;re then making decisions based on</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.170" end="00:52:18.220" style="s2">what we&#39;ve put into the system</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.580" end="00:52:22.030" style="s2">no because AI kid like I&#39;m like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.220" end="00:52:24.250" style="s2">so many ways but it&#39;s not showing up you</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.030" end="00:52:25.960" style="s2">should can&#39;t really be gamed no I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.250" end="00:52:27.430" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a thing that&#39;s a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.960" end="00:52:29.140" style="s2">different thing know that these people</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.430" end="00:52:31.030" style="s2">are dude like there&#39;s no AI or anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.140" end="00:52:35.100" style="s2">like that it&#39;s just how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.030" end="00:52:39.520" style="s2">conversations that are generative and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.100" end="00:52:41.880" style="s2">sort of you know a game the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.520" end="00:52:44.770" style="s2">thing that can potentially out-compete</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.880" end="00:52:46.780" style="s2">game a structures how do we think</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.770" end="00:52:49.750" style="s2">collectively and really maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.780" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">intelligence of a crowd of people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.750" end="00:52:52.420" style="s2">like what what are the ways that you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:55.960" style="s2">have the conversation what are the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.420" end="00:52:58.690" style="s2">things to look out for like um one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.960" end="00:53:02.140" style="s2">the ideas that&#39;s put out there as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.690" end="00:53:06.190" style="s2">of a practice or a principle that people</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.140" end="00:53:07.990" style="s2">can use is rule Omega so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.190" end="00:53:10.510" style="s2">rule Omega is when someone sees</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.990" end="00:53:11.960" style="s2">something that at first comes across as</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.510" end="00:53:15.589" style="s2">stupid or</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.960" end="00:53:18.859" style="s2">not very well-thought-out rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.589" end="00:53:21.049" style="s2">suggest that you should just assume that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.859" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">you haven&#39;t if it sounds obvious it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.049" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">sounds stupid then it just assumed that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:26.680" style="s2">you haven&#39;t quite understood what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:29.420" style="s2">were saying that they haven&#39;t like quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.680" end="00:53:30.920" style="s2">explained it in a way that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.420" end="00:53:32.510" style="s2">resonates with you and then so just ask</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.920" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">questions and try to win busy to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.510" end="00:53:37.160" style="s2">there and unravel that and so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:39.680" style="s2">mean I think that&#39;s generally a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.160" end="00:53:40.819" style="s2">idea although I might my criticism there</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.680" end="00:53:41.990" style="s2">would be you&#39;d have to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.819" end="00:53:45.740" style="s2">demonstrate that you were able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.990" end="00:53:47.480" style="s2">generate ideas that were interesting or</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.740" end="00:53:48.799" style="s2">maybe any kind of sense in the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.480" end="00:53:50.660" style="s2">place because a lot of people just say</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.799" end="00:53:52.460" style="s2">nonsense and it&#39;s like well you know if</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.660" end="00:53:54.200" style="s2">they just say nonsense all the time the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.460" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">chances are investigating that this</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.200" end="00:54:01.430" style="s2">probably if you put an idea out there it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:03.230" style="s2">can absolutely be critiqued and people</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.430" end="00:54:04.760" style="s2">are gonna ask questions yeah that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.230" end="00:54:05.960" style="s2">you know what I hope that&#39;s not break</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.760" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">you know make a rule like I hope it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.960" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">not cuz it&#39;s like what about because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:11.150" style="s2">is being curious well what about this it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:12.740" style="s2">breaks down because of this what about</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.150" end="00:54:14.180" style="s2">this what about this that&#39;s hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.740" end="00:54:16.369" style="s2">making it better and if it makes it fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.180" end="00:54:18.529" style="s2">apart it kind of was supposed to fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.369" end="00:54:20.539" style="s2">apart exactly exactly well it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.529" end="00:54:24.109" style="s2">just the Socratic method like and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.539" end="00:54:26.779" style="s2">think that&#39;s yeah just it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.109" end="00:54:29.420" style="s2">good way to learn more about what other</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.779" end="00:54:33.319" style="s2">people know and - what about what you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.420" end="00:54:34.670" style="s2">know because you know we as people were</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.319" end="00:54:36.349" style="s2">very fallible in the way that we think</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.670" end="00:54:39.410" style="s2">about things we have all these biases</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.349" end="00:54:40.819" style="s2">that just bad like there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.410" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">formal training on how to think</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.819" end="00:54:45.619" style="s2">logically within our education systems</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">at the moment so you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.619" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">of their stuff that we have to work</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:53.029" style="s2">through by ourselves and in groups so I</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:56.089" style="s2">think those technologies and and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.029" end="00:54:58.010" style="s2">got other things like circling which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.089" end="00:55:01.520" style="s2">still a little bit sort of vague about</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.010" end="00:55:04.220" style="s2">as a concept but yeah the thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.520" end="00:55:06.140" style="s2">posted on circling so confusing however</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.220" end="00:55:08.119" style="s2">if you go to the website on circling</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.140" end="00:55:10.849" style="s2">there&#39;s like a free two-hour seminar</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.119" end="00:55:12.890" style="s2">thing that made sense then walk through</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.849" end="00:55:14.839" style="s2">act you do a circling and I think he</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.890" end="00:55:17.630" style="s2">does he does it with a woman like uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.839" end="00:55:20.869" style="s2">eggs the the podcast that was talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.630" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">about circling I&#39;m like what is to get</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.869" end="00:55:25.530" style="s2">it I&#39;m like I get it that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">they were told cafe to but like</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.530" end="00:55:34.020" style="s2">I was I was quite confused because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:36.840" style="s2">we&#39;re having a zoom call tomorrow in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.020" end="00:55:39.870" style="s2">morning about it like I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.840" end="00:55:41.580" style="s2">this is but but yeah I mean it I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.870" end="00:55:45.030" style="s2">there was another one that the lady was</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.580" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">talking about which reverse bowling</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.030" end="00:55:49.920" style="s2">dialogue not sure if I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:51.990" style="s2">right but just the idea is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.920" end="00:55:53.460" style="s2">you just say what&#39;s coming to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.990" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">and you just respond as off but</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.460" end="00:56:05.460" style="s2">authentically as you can and throughout</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:07.620" style="s2">the conversation which well I think one</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.460" end="00:56:10.770" style="s2">of the interesting ideas or interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.620" end="00:56:13.140" style="s2">ways that this can go is just opening up</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.770" end="00:56:15.180" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to be honest and to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.140" end="00:56:16.830" style="s2">critical because I think there is always</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.180" end="00:56:20.220" style="s2">a filter when you&#39;re having a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.830" end="00:56:23.790" style="s2">with people and yeah I wonder how much</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.220" end="00:56:25.980" style="s2">that actually negatively impacts you</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.790" end="00:56:28.920" style="s2">know the long-term outcome of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.980" end="00:56:30.510" style="s2">conversations because obviously it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.920" end="00:56:34.170" style="s2">to hear things that are kind of critical</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.510" end="00:56:35.310" style="s2">and sometimes harsh but you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.170" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">always have those critical thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.310" end="00:56:39.990" style="s2">thoughts in my head and they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:43.050" style="s2">a tool for me to refine my own thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.990" end="00:56:44.340" style="s2">and sort of check myself so some people</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.050" end="00:56:48.180" style="s2">haven&#39;t developed those things maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.340" end="00:56:50.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea to you know bring that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.180" end="00:56:52.590" style="s2">into their mind space not to not to</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.130" end="00:56:55.500" style="s2">bring them down but to give them a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.590" end="00:56:57.380" style="s2">more critical structure and because</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.500" end="00:57:00.540" style="s2">because I think part of the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.380" end="00:57:02.100" style="s2">thinking as a collective being able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.540" end="00:57:05.130" style="s2">implement the tools that you already use</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.100" end="00:57:08.900" style="s2">yourself is sort of openly as you do</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.130" end="00:57:11.610" style="s2">with your with your own person who knows</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.900" end="00:57:13.440" style="s2">not recorded on YouTube because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.610" end="00:57:15.780" style="s2">posting this so that it&#39;s it&#39;s on this</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.440" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">site so I&#39;m gonna end this here and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.780" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t ask all right bye people</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">ciao sorry alright</p>
