<p begin="00:00:04.160" end="00:00:07.860" style="s2">I have a plan that I want to talk to you about.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.980" end="00:00:12.440" style="s2"> I think most of you are already subscribing to the channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.300" style="s2"> You like the contents of the channel. I want to improve it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2"> There are some things about the videos, especially the videos of the lectures, that I do not like very much.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.240" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2"> And I think you are not satisfied either.</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:30.260" style="s2"> First of all, I think the videos lack proper visuals.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:38.220" style="s2"> There are also some parts of the videos that are specific to students in my classroom only.</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:42.080" style="s2"> Like information about exams and so on. And there are other parts of the videos that are not audible.</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.140" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2"> Or when digression is not appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.340" end="00:00:50.580" style="s2"> Also, there are lectures for years on the same topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.700" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2"> Which should be standardized in a specific way in order to be properly understood and defined.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.860" end="00:01:04.300" style="s2"> Also, I would like the text of the lectures to be accessible to all, and it would be better if the lectures were entitled.</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:08.860" style="s2"> The text of the lectures will help with this. Then after this it will be possible to translate the lectures.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.120" end="00:01:12.980" style="s2"> I have some volunteers working on this right now.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.180" end="00:01:19.220" style="s2"> So I created a page on a site called Petreon.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.060" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2"> Petrion allows people who are interested in content, let&#39;s move a YouTube channel like this,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:32.420" style="s2"> To assist in the continuous development of the projects that are being shared there.</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.100" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2"> So ... if you are interested in participating in this and want to see the things I have described</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.680" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2"> Click and subscribe to maybe this will be a good thing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.300" end="00:01:47.720" style="s2"> This is what I wanted to share.</p>
