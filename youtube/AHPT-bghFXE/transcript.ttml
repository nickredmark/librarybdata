<p begin="00:02:08.210" end="00:02:14.990" style="s2">yeah but then it&#39;s not as conservative</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.990" end="00:02:21.350" style="s2">and that conservative in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">it preserves capital and power in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.350" end="00:02:26.870" style="s2">places where it has always been it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">time we&#39;re not thinking at all are we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.630" end="00:05:46.440" style="s2">just solve like repeating the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.060" style="s2">over with our heads you know and so this</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.279" end="00:05:54.569" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah yeah that&#39;s it and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.110" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">reinforces what we believe in I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.569" end="00:06:00.139" style="s2">it&#39;s George Bernard Shaw he he once</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:03.690" style="s2">quoted because I have become famous</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.139" end="00:06:10.020" style="s2">because I think I think about once or</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.830" end="00:06:16.889" style="s2">not thinking that way</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.659" style="s2">actually no you know what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.889" end="00:06:20.879" style="s2">your head it&#39;s just stuff you&#39;ve heard</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.229" end="00:06:28.349" style="s2">Jordan Peterson talks a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.849" end="00:06:29.849" style="s2">the thinking is hard you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.349" end="00:06:31.529" style="s2">very few people are capable of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.849" end="00:06:32.399" style="s2">at an individual level because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.529" end="00:06:34.889" style="s2">requires you to take</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.530" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">very very unique position so I&#39;m free to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:25.320" style="s2">change my view of the world it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.930" end="00:08:30.390" style="s2">really can&#39;t just do that they can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.320" end="00:08:32.030" style="s2">that but I understand why it hasn&#39;t got</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.390" end="00:08:34.650" style="s2">a foothold because it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.030" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">unbelievably radical it requires a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.650" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">complete re-evaluation of the way you</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:40.229" style="s2">see yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:41.820" style="s2">and the world and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.229" end="00:08:42.150" style="s2">between those two things you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.820" end="00:08:47.100" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.150" end="00:08:49.380" style="s2">and okay yeah I do understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.100" end="00:08:52.200" style="s2">mean and I can sort of have some</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">sympathy and even empathy for that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.200" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">position but I tend not to agree you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:09:00.090" style="s2">know I don&#39;t think that is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:02.600" style="s2">why we&#39;re not getting hurt yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.090" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">the reason why we&#39;re not getting hurt is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.600" end="00:09:07.590" style="s2">basically we don&#39;t want to share our</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">value add to movement we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.590" end="00:09:14.430" style="s2">share about it so maybe you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">too frightened fire because we&#39;re scared</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.430" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">of not succeeding which is a shit reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:25.380" style="s2">Emilio shit why because I&#39;m scared I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">might fail is a shit reason for not</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.380" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">doing something so you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:34.470" style="s2">probably hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:36.690" style="s2">supporters across the globe domi</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.470" end="00:09:40.550" style="s2">probably more actually and we would</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.690" end="00:09:44.220" style="s2">probably get a lot more if eminent</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.269" end="00:13:56.109" style="s2">the majority then consistency yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.539" end="00:13:58.689" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.109" end="00:14:00.699" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the major influences you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.689" end="00:14:04.029" style="s2">got to be consistent yeah you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.699" end="00:14:07.989" style="s2">keep doing it and yeah so so yeah it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.029" end="00:14:09.339" style="s2">and that that would really help mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.989" end="00:14:11.859" style="s2">there&#39;s these other things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.339" end="00:14:14.769" style="s2">do do to you know to help raise</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.859" end="00:14:17.019" style="s2">awareness as well but generally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.769" end="00:14:19.929" style="s2">where we&#39;re I believe here we&#39;ve we</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.019" end="00:14:22.949" style="s2">gotta go because you know we created the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.929" end="00:14:27.039" style="s2">money free pie and it allows people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.949" end="00:14:30.099" style="s2">vote for you know direct transition to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.039" end="00:14:35.229" style="s2">resource-based economy but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.099" end="00:14:40.839" style="s2">create the value shift that&#39;s needed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.229" end="00:14:43.659" style="s2">vote for that yeah yeah okay and so yo</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.069" end="00:15:01.179" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t take off because there</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.769" end="00:15:02.709" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough people yo doing it because</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.179" end="00:15:05.949" style="s2">there&#39;s not because that value change</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.709" end="00:15:08.559" style="s2">start somewhere I mean yeah yeah well is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.949" end="00:15:11.859" style="s2">it but the thing is the fan you change</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.929" end="00:15:24.939" style="s2">confronting the values of the majority</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.299" end="00:15:27.130" style="s2">that&#39;s when the blacks when and how the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.939" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">value shifts happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.130" end="00:15:32.200" style="s2">that happens you know and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:34.350" style="s2">what we got doing and and making</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.200" end="00:15:37.000" style="s2">whatever alternative currencies or</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.350" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">alternative ways to swap and trade</p>

<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:44.770" style="s2">allow the facilitation of of what we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.640" end="00:15:47.410" style="s2">want to see but they don&#39;t create that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.770" end="00:15:49.030" style="s2">value change that value change is going</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.410" end="00:15:52.090" style="s2">to occur the fact that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.030" end="00:15:54.430" style="s2">popping into existence is indicative of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.090" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">the fact that those value changes are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">starting to occur right otherwise why</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.950" end="00:16:03.310" style="s2">these I think I think there&#39;s I think a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:06.040" style="s2">seed of something I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.310" end="00:16:08.920" style="s2">well naturally you know everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.040" end="00:16:10.750" style="s2">changes including values okay and so now</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.920" end="00:16:12.970" style="s2">we get on to sort of like a new world</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.750" end="00:16:16.300" style="s2">right if the world is continually</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.970" end="00:16:19.960" style="s2">evolving society&#39;s evolving and the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.300" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">I see the society evolving you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.960" end="00:16:25.960" style="s2">gonna be we&#39;re gonna so basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">reinforce this three-tier society that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.960" end="00:16:30.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve got now where we&#39;ve got you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:33.820" style="s2">the elites right at the top okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.580" end="00:16:35.950" style="s2">there with ya and they just tell me to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.820" end="00:16:38.440" style="s2">talk about them then we got there that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.950" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">the favored professionals and the lucky</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.440" end="00:16:43.990" style="s2">ones living in their gated communities</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">you know and then at the bottom you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.990" end="00:16:47.860" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all the masses of called</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:50.110" style="s2">people and those poor people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.860" end="00:16:52.210" style="s2">gonna be in the future they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.110" end="00:16:55.540" style="s2">living off of sort of like what we call</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.210" end="00:16:57.460" style="s2">the collective Commons okay they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.540" end="00:17:01.570" style="s2">scraping around for scraps from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.460" end="00:17:03.790" style="s2">collective Commons you bi yo Universal</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.570" end="00:17:06.069" style="s2">bakes we can become that might even be</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.790" end="00:17:08.470" style="s2">part paid in crypto currencies by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.069" end="00:17:11.050" style="s2">time we get it rolled out and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.470" end="00:17:14.350" style="s2">yeah is indicative of what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.050" end="00:17:17.500" style="s2">so like you know swabbing and free stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.350" end="00:17:19.480" style="s2">you know of goods and services but there</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.500" end="00:17:22.650" style="s2">are very low-level goods goods and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.480" end="00:17:24.970" style="s2">services yeah and not what we they want</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.650" end="00:17:27.790" style="s2">value there isn&#39;t the trust in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.970" end="00:17:31.150" style="s2">system yet right for people is it there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.790" end="00:17:33.010" style="s2">isn&#39;t it trust and also there isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.150" end="00:17:36.040" style="s2">capital to go into it there&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.010" end="00:17:37.810" style="s2">resources to go into that system no I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.040" end="00:17:40.260" style="s2">mean Colin&#39;s vision is one of us sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.810" end="00:17:42.220" style="s2">slowly accreting</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.260" end="00:17:44.740" style="s2">snowball rolling down and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.220" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">ever-increasing slope you know to me and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.740" end="00:17:50.110" style="s2">so it starts very very very slowly but</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:52.809" style="s2">as it picks up speed that brings more</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.110" end="00:17:54.700" style="s2">you know that encourages more people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.809" end="00:17:56.050" style="s2">come into it and it&#39;s like a exponential</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.700" end="00:17:57.250" style="s2">once once you&#39;ve reached a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.050" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you know like an</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.250" end="00:18:00.940" style="s2">exponential runaway thing I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">got a point but this but the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.940" end="00:18:07.270" style="s2">the beginning is as you say there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:08.920" style="s2">the value shift in the minds of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.270" end="00:18:10.570" style="s2">people in the society to drive them</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.920" end="00:18:13.090" style="s2">towards the use of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.570" end="00:18:14.710" style="s2">systems but then the increasing use of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.090" end="00:18:16.179" style="s2">those kinds of systems will start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.710" end="00:18:19.020" style="s2">create those values you know I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.179" end="00:18:21.309" style="s2">a yeah if you do get an increasing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.020" end="00:18:24.120" style="s2">increasing use I mean what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.309" end="00:18:29.380" style="s2">the let system you familiar with the let</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.120" end="00:18:33.400" style="s2">the let&#39;s yeah that&#39;s cool okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.380" end="00:18:37.179" style="s2">fillion local exchange trading systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.400" end="00:18:39.580" style="s2">okay okay and these took off in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.179" end="00:18:41.830" style="s2">and I say they took off</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.580" end="00:18:43.960" style="s2">they took off they went they went they</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.830" end="00:18:47.559" style="s2">were noble they would so like every</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.960" end="00:18:49.270" style="s2">local sub area all over the world well</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.559" end="00:18:51.010" style="s2">all over the Western world anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.270" end="00:18:53.320" style="s2">know we had them throughout Europe we</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.010" end="00:18:55.720" style="s2">had begot systems in America all over</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.320" end="00:18:59.530" style="s2">the UK nearly every area in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.720" end="00:19:02.440" style="s2">hasn&#39;t or had them they still exist</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.530" end="00:19:04.390" style="s2">somewhat is what happens is yeah when we</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.440" end="00:19:06.990" style="s2">create and basically they were an</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.390" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">alternative currency you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.990" end="00:19:11.070" style="s2">theoretically with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:17.950" style="s2">theoretically with this you could</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:20.050" style="s2">basically resolve global poverty yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.950" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">that&#39;s so like theoretic you could do</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.050" end="00:19:26.050" style="s2">that yeah if you&#39;ve got people using</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:28.030" style="s2">them but yeah the people didn&#39;t use them</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.050" end="00:19:30.250" style="s2">no they started off not people using</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.030" end="00:19:32.110" style="s2">them but not enough people use them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.250" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">make them powerful enough and slowly</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.110" end="00:19:37.720" style="s2">they em away and there&#39;s to exist in</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:40.450" style="s2">lots of places let&#39;s local exchange</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.720" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">train systems but they&#39;ve got no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.450" end="00:19:44.620" style="s2">real power you know to make any</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:47.860" style="s2">difference because not enough people use</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.620" end="00:19:50.530" style="s2">them and the other worry that the value</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.860" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">change is not happen modified right in</p>

<p begin="00:25:05.960" end="00:25:12.289" style="s2">minority they were very radical yo and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.340" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">and because they&#39;ve been consistent in</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.289" end="00:25:17.350" style="s2">their votes yeah yeah they&#39;ve got more</p>

<p begin="00:25:37.010" end="00:25:39.889" style="s2">exchange ideas and they have little</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.389" end="00:25:42.019" style="s2">training sessions about how to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.889" end="00:25:43.820" style="s2">various situations and so on and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.019" end="00:25:48.049" style="s2">gives people a sense of involvement and</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.049" end="00:25:54.889" style="s2">and here we lack that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:56.600" style="s2">infrastructure yeah yeah and we yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.889" end="00:25:59.179" style="s2">there&#39;s we have some different</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.250" end="00:27:46.870" style="s2">kind of membership is neither capable of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.490" end="00:27:49.480" style="s2">achieving anything serious nor do they</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.870" end="00:27:53.320" style="s2">have any real moral justice on their</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.480" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">side whereas the black women&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.320" end="00:27:58.870" style="s2">movements had tons of moles justice on</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:28:02.770" style="s2">this side so basically he was saying you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.870" end="00:28:08.110" style="s2">say no they&#39;re bunch of middle class</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.770" end="00:28:09.400" style="s2">twit actually from the system saying the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.110" end="00:28:14.350" style="s2">middle of their complaining about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.400" end="00:28:18.130" style="s2">right okay but then I looked again and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.350" end="00:28:19.900" style="s2">saw what he just said and so I made it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.130" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">last bit of the quote because this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.900" end="00:28:28.060" style="s2">leader of our movement right he goes nor</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:32.020" style="s2">do they have any real moral justice on</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.060" end="00:28:35.230" style="s2">their side do you get that yeah no we</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.020" end="00:28:39.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have any moral justice on our side</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.230" end="00:28:42.790" style="s2">so that is a believer of laser a leader</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.130" end="00:28:44.290" style="s2">of our movement saying that we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.790" end="00:28:45.880" style="s2">one set I think you might be slightly</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.290" end="00:28:46.300" style="s2">taking out of context that I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.880" end="00:28:48.820" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.300" end="00:28:51.370" style="s2">about the ideals of the movement he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.820" end="00:28:54.460" style="s2">talking about the member he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.370" end="00:28:57.280" style="s2">about that membership of it right so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.460" end="00:28:59.770" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah any more dresses</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:29:06.070" style="s2">but regardless who you are whether</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.070" end="00:29:14.620" style="s2">manual worker you know or or a spoilt</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.450" end="00:29:23.260" style="s2">middle-class Brad you know waste every</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.620" end="00:29:27.310" style="s2">the model justice is on your side yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.260" end="00:29:30.450" style="s2">yeah the more the morality here is our</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.310" end="00:29:33.040" style="s2">world is being screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.450" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">environmentally ninety percent of</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.530" end="00:29:52.330" style="s2">right to get off of our backsides and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.080" end="00:29:54.100" style="s2">demand a better world right now I agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.330" end="00:29:55.480" style="s2">with all of that but I think I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.100" end="00:29:57.910" style="s2">point is making the lack of moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.480" end="00:30:00.550" style="s2">justification comes when your motivate</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.910" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">when your desire for bringing about RBE</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.550" end="00:30:03.820" style="s2">is so that you can have everything you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:04.780" style="s2">want without having to do any work I</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.820" end="00:30:08.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s the point that he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.780" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">you like ya know when that is your</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.200" end="00:30:12.940" style="s2">motivation I think that&#39;s the point that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:15.940" style="s2">he&#39;s making know what everything he just</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.940" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">said I&#39;m caught I agree with all of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.940" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be here together</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.160" end="00:30:25.690" style="s2">but I think he&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.210" end="00:30:27.130" style="s2">exactly I think listen I don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.690" end="00:30:28.870" style="s2">that well but I think you and I are both</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.130" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">in the position where we are seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:34.120" style="s2">bring this about not for our own</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">personal easy life but because we seek</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.120" end="00:30:38.770" style="s2">to liberate the spirit of man so that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">can go on to do much better things than</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:44.650" style="s2">we&#39;re currently doing that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">coming from certainly yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.650" end="00:30:48.910" style="s2">such a strange moving we live it because</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.820" style="s2">we got tbp right the Venus Project and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.910" end="00:30:55.480" style="s2">yeah fed page them you know they got</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.820" end="00:30:57.970" style="s2">their agenda and then but somehow I saw</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.480" end="00:30:59.920" style="s2">I do doubt whether they&#39;ll actually get</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.970" end="00:31:03.520" style="s2">their City bill and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.920" end="00:31:05.920" style="s2">if they do get that CD bit what will</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.520" end="00:31:08.350" style="s2">happen I&#39;m not sure then we got the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.920" end="00:31:11.260" style="s2">zeitgeist movement who seen whose focus</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.350" end="00:31:15.790" style="s2">seemed to be some sort of giving other</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.260" end="00:31:19.780" style="s2">non RBE groups a sort of platform to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.790" end="00:31:22.660" style="s2">talk on and I think a lot of light so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.780" end="00:31:26.740" style="s2">got movement activists actually leave</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.660" end="00:31:30.220" style="s2">zeitgeist and go into the the reformist</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.740" end="00:31:33.190" style="s2">groups of their giving space - and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.220" end="00:31:34.840" style="s2">we got like the free world charter and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.190" end="00:31:38.770" style="s2">think everybody&#39;s just hanging out to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.840" end="00:31:41.650" style="s2">see what Colin or Colin does there and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.770" end="00:31:44.530" style="s2">then we got like money free pie and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.650" end="00:31:47.020" style="s2">we&#39;re just dead in the war because most</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.530" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">people with our movement you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.020" end="00:31:52.270" style="s2">be like politics if you--if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.420" style="s2">go forward as a political party in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.270" end="00:31:57.610" style="s2">in the established way that&#39;s how how</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.420" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">they achieved it not my specs we would</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.610" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">actually stand a genuine chance if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:04.540" style="s2">were to organize ourselves we said a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:08.190" style="s2">genuine sell one or two MEP selected yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.540" end="00:32:10.840" style="s2">and and in local elections as well yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.190" end="00:32:13.660" style="s2">that sounds you know smaller party</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.840" end="00:32:17.080" style="s2">started yeah every small party that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.660" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">all like got to household name started</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.080" end="00:32:22.900" style="s2">like that by getting its first member</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:24.100" style="s2">related into the smaller assembly and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.900" end="00:32:25.780" style="s2">know once you&#39;ve got a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.100" end="00:32:27.160" style="s2">representatives there then you actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.780" end="00:32:28.750" style="s2">have a platform when it comes to general</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.160" end="00:32:30.370" style="s2">election time as well right then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.750" end="00:32:31.660" style="s2">actually you know yeah you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.370" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">chance of getting on the telly and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.660" end="00:32:35.950" style="s2">getting getting a little bit of paper</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:37.570" style="s2">space and so on I think elections and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.950" end="00:32:39.640" style="s2">the upcoming European elections it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.570" end="00:32:42.580" style="s2">interesting to see how many new small</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.640" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">little niche parties are start with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.580" end="00:32:49.450" style="s2">was it was a good it is a good time for</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:52.750" style="s2">that but it was as well before the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.450" end="00:32:55.540" style="s2">credit crunch in 2008 before the credit</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.750" end="00:32:57.430" style="s2">crunch in 2008 it was a time for little</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.540" end="00:32:58.930" style="s2">pies the little parties and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.430" end="00:33:01.900" style="s2">independents were just coming on too</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.930" end="00:33:05.610" style="s2">strong and then crack the credit crunch</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.900" end="00:33:09.640" style="s2">came in we had the Lib Dem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.610" end="00:33:11.860" style="s2">conservative coalition here that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.640" end="00:33:13.270" style="s2">like everybody got pissed off with that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:15.610" style="s2">because the Lib Dems</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.270" end="00:33:18.400" style="s2">about student fees except for the next</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.610" end="00:33:23.320" style="s2">donation everybody went out to punish</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.400" end="00:33:28.120" style="s2">the Lib Dems yeah Tory yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.320" end="00:33:30.430" style="s2">that&#39;s why exactly they did it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.120" end="00:33:32.650" style="s2">bit strange and going back to that idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.430" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">of saying there&#39;s no unified sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.650" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">goal within us and no unified movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.670" end="00:33:45.940" style="s2">it&#39;s so true you know I mean my goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:49.060" style="s2">always you know has been to get the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.940" end="00:33:52.600" style="s2">argument get the concept an argument</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.060" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">into public debate and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.600" end="00:33:56.680" style="s2">want it and I think if all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:33:59.620" style="s2">organization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.680" end="00:34:02.230" style="s2">had that as its goal because that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.620" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">to happen yet unless we get this idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.230" end="00:34:08.620" style="s2">into public debate it&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:11.140" style="s2">and it should have happened years ago it</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.620" end="00:34:13.150" style="s2">needed to happen years ago you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.140" end="00:34:15.250" style="s2">we&#39;re probably far too late for it now</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.150" end="00:34:17.560" style="s2">because the environmental is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.250" end="00:34:22.660" style="s2">environment is so you know it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.560" end="00:34:28.170" style="s2">trashed you know that&#39;s anyway so if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.660" end="00:34:32.020" style="s2">can just so somehow inspire our</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.170" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">memberships you know to sort of unify</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.020" end="00:34:36.520" style="s2">and try to get it out of yo into public</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.500" style="s2">debates we know how to get stuff into</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.520" end="00:34:42.360" style="s2">public debate did we see it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.500" end="00:34:44.470" style="s2">Joey we&#39;ve seen extinction we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.360" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">the thing that they&#39;ve done which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.470" end="00:34:48.340" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:51.160" style="s2">that they have found one issue which</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.340" end="00:34:53.110" style="s2">everybody has united behind right now I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.160" end="00:34:55.330" style="s2">mean III don&#39;t personally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.110" end="00:34:57.790" style="s2">that as an issue but nevertheless it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.330" end="00:34:59.170" style="s2">had the power to bring thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.790" end="00:35:00.700" style="s2">people out willing to get arrested</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.170" end="00:35:03.240" style="s2">willing to live on the streets for days</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.700" end="00:35:06.550" style="s2">on end living you know sleeping in tents</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.240" end="00:35:08.980" style="s2">yeah not since occupy have we seen</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.950" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">okay and if those demands are met</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.350" end="00:42:28.450" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna really radically</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:31.240" style="s2">achieve anything no bully and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.450" end="00:42:33.610" style="s2">saying like a People&#39;s Assembly sounds</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.240" end="00:42:36.490" style="s2">good but you&#39;ve got to so realize that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.610" end="00:42:39.880" style="s2">the state of the environment that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.490" end="00:42:41.980" style="s2">in now is a result of our values</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.880" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s about it&#39;s all like putting</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.980" end="00:42:46.780" style="s2">profit before environment and that&#39;s set</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">to our values you know society&#39;s value</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.780" end="00:42:52.750" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to create an assembly of</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.000" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">people with those values to sort out the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.750" end="00:42:56.350" style="s2">value do you sweat and I mean there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:42:57.910" style="s2">sort of clear thing about how those</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.350" end="00:42:59.260" style="s2">people are beaten to be select so I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.910" end="00:43:04.540" style="s2">heard something about a random selection</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.260" end="00:43:10.030" style="s2">process a total waste of time and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.540" end="00:43:11.500" style="s2">have to change the whole so yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.030" end="00:43:13.360" style="s2">know put loads of statues through</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.500" end="00:43:15.310" style="s2">Parliament to actually get that because</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.360" end="00:43:20.620" style="s2">you they basically wanted to overload</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.310" end="00:43:22.870" style="s2">Parliament don&#39;t they that in a way our</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.620" end="00:43:24.460" style="s2">existing system we are supposed to it we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.870" end="00:43:26.170" style="s2">owe that we the electorate are supposed</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.460" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">to have the power to override Parliament</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.170" end="00:43:31.270" style="s2">but in a practical day-to-day sense of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.980" style="s2">course we don&#39;t and when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.270" end="00:43:34.360" style="s2">election time what are our actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.980" end="00:43:35.830" style="s2">options that we&#39;re but you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.360" end="00:43:37.420" style="s2">the actual options we&#39;re presented with</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.830" end="00:43:39.640" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.420" end="00:43:41.500" style="s2">can we going back to our going to hook</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.510" end="00:44:16.540" style="s2">climate change narrative could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.740" end="00:44:18.330" style="s2">exactly that as well a distraction from</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.540" end="00:44:21.849" style="s2">actually dealing with the real</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.330" end="00:44:24.999" style="s2">ecological disasters going on right now</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.209" end="00:44:35.949" style="s2">we were using the term environmental</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:39.339" style="s2">degradation yeah thank you mean our</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.949" end="00:44:42.910" style="s2">argument because you can&#39;t deny nobody</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.339" end="00:44:46.239" style="s2">can deny awful devastating offenses that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.910" end="00:44:49.269" style="s2">yo consumerism has absolutely no</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.769" end="00:44:55.599" style="s2">global warming well by mental</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.099" end="00:44:56.829" style="s2">degradation is a much better term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.599" end="00:44:59.160" style="s2">much more encompassing and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.829" end="00:45:03.789" style="s2">air yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.160" end="00:45:05.829" style="s2">that the name of the party money free</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.829" end="00:45:10.349" style="s2">encountered this a few times in a few</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.479" end="00:45:13.390" style="s2">different situations do you not find</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.349" end="00:45:15.190" style="s2">people sort of doing things voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.390" end="00:45:16.150" style="s2">just basically can&#39;t rely on them you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.190" end="00:45:21.249" style="s2">know what I mean there&#39;s no deadline</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.150" end="00:45:23.319" style="s2">there&#39;s no quid pro ya home because</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.249" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">we&#39;re so conditioned to responding some</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.319" end="00:45:25.690" style="s2">money as an incentive to do things you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:27.910" style="s2">know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.690" end="00:45:30.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a real problem it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.910" end="00:45:33.549" style="s2">a real problem that I&#39;ve seen yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.190" end="00:45:37.089" style="s2">mean I think that&#39;s all over the yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.549" end="00:45:44.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not just down to the money free</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.089" end="00:45:46.469" style="s2">pass a big problem you know it&#39;s a this</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.890" end="00:45:51.609" style="s2">could kind of lead us on to a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.469" end="00:45:56.499" style="s2">discussion altogether actually yeah ya</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.609" end="00:46:01.930" style="s2">know I found that it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.499" end="00:46:03.670" style="s2">pain in the artery I think I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.930" end="00:46:04.779" style="s2">the collective consciousness is turned</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.670" end="00:46:08.680" style="s2">the way forward is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.779" end="00:46:13.150" style="s2">and that requires proper communication</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.680" end="00:46:14.739" style="s2">and be faithful in so far as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.150" end="00:46:15.969" style="s2">possible to do so transfer of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.739" end="00:46:17.229" style="s2">information and knowledge from one</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.969" end="00:46:19.390" style="s2">person to the next right</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.229" end="00:46:21.519" style="s2">as soon as knowledge distorted by</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.390" end="00:46:23.789" style="s2">individual ideologies along the way well</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.519" end="00:46:27.400" style="s2">now the collective doesn&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.789" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">you know maybe they&#39;re you know sharing</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.400" end="00:46:34.650" style="s2">of knowledge and information can only</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:34.650" style="s2">happen when we&#39;re not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.030" end="00:46:40.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a non silver ball so communication</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:45.090" style="s2">is happening honest or deep deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.770" end="00:46:47.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know is a subject did anybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.090" end="00:46:49.470" style="s2">talk about that do you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.250" end="00:46:50.940" style="s2">actually a guy called Jordan Hall who I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.470" end="00:46:52.950" style="s2">really really really like he has</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.940" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">unbelievably high-level conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.950" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">and I quite often have to rewind and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:47:00.360" style="s2">listen to bits of it two or three times</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:02.280" style="s2">to get the whole unbelievably dense</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.360" end="00:47:04.710" style="s2">conversations about this so he&#39;d just</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.280" end="00:47:06.390" style="s2">very very very quickly on outline his</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.710" end="00:47:08.520" style="s2">thing he wrote an essay about this</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.390" end="00:47:10.980" style="s2">shortly after Trump came came into power</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.520" end="00:47:13.470" style="s2">and he saw that as the end basically the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.980" end="00:47:16.740" style="s2">game a so game a as far as he is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.470" end="00:47:18.840" style="s2">concerned began some tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.740" end="00:47:20.310" style="s2">of years ago so for 50,000 years or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.840" end="00:47:22.260" style="s2">whatever human beings were the top</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.310" end="00:47:24.450" style="s2">creditor they occupied every niche on</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:26.730" style="s2">the planet and were the most successful</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.450" end="00:47:28.080" style="s2">species on the planet for about 50,000</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.730" end="00:47:31.650" style="s2">years until they started to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.080" end="00:47:34.350" style="s2">each other right and at that point game</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.650" end="00:47:36.510" style="s2">a began and game a was the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.350" end="00:47:38.490" style="s2">the problem how can larger numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.510" end="00:47:40.080" style="s2">people coexist with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.490" end="00:47:41.250" style="s2">collaborate with each other cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.080" end="00:47:43.260" style="s2">with each other without killing each</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.250" end="00:47:45.030" style="s2">other all right and so for the last</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.260" end="00:47:47.340" style="s2">whatever it is twenty thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.030" end="00:47:48.930" style="s2">years we&#39;ve been playing game a and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.340" end="00:47:51.450" style="s2">thinks that game a has reached its</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.930" end="00:47:53.610" style="s2">zenith now game a did this human society</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.450" end="00:47:56.280" style="s2">human ideas technology and so on have</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.610" end="00:47:57.750" style="s2">become so complicated now but game a can</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.280" end="00:47:59.370" style="s2">no longer cope with it and game a is</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.750" end="00:48:02.220" style="s2">coming to an end and we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.370" end="00:48:03.630" style="s2">playing game B and so he then starts to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.220" end="00:48:06.870" style="s2">talk a little bit about what he sees</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.630" end="00:48:08.760" style="s2">game B as looking like and they think</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.870" end="00:48:09.930" style="s2">Sam a feed what you were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.760" end="00:48:11.790" style="s2">about actually one of the main features</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.930" end="00:48:17.030" style="s2">of game B is what is what equals</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.790" end="00:48:19.290" style="s2">coherence where people are able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.030" end="00:48:22.770" style="s2">exactly that come together collectively</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.290" end="00:48:25.380" style="s2">and in the interaction between the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.770" end="00:48:27.060" style="s2">people a thing is created which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.380" end="00:48:29.670" style="s2">bigger than the sum of the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.060" end="00:48:31.740" style="s2">those people you know I mean a an idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.670" end="00:48:33.660" style="s2">or a structure of thought or whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.740" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">created which no one of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.660" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">individuals could possibly have done on</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:39.570" style="s2">their own but the collaboration of all</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:41.070" style="s2">of those things and so coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.570" end="00:48:43.740" style="s2">something like people are sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.070" end="00:48:46.680" style="s2">talking someone says something and most</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.740" end="00:48:48.059" style="s2">of all that person says is noise but in</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.680" end="00:48:49.949" style="s2">amongst that noise is</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.059" end="00:48:51.719" style="s2">no and it is the job of the other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.949" end="00:48:53.699" style="s2">in that conversation to discern noise</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.719" end="00:48:56.489" style="s2">from signal okay what I heard in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.699" end="00:48:58.650" style="s2">that is useful is this and they react</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.489" end="00:49:00.539" style="s2">you late it in a new way repackage it</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.650" end="00:49:03.809" style="s2">adding to it something of their own and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.539" end="00:49:06.630" style="s2">so this thing evolves as it moves around</p>
