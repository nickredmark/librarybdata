<p begin="00:00:03.750" end="00:00:07.410" style="s2">for your support many of you voted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">have me address sympathy and empathy</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:11.580" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.780" end="00:00:12.990" style="s2">it&#39;s an excellent choice the topic is</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">one of my favorites and it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.990" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">possibly be more important at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">moment in history I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:21.029" style="s2">attempt to define these terms</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">etymologically to say how they came into</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.029" end="00:00:25.350" style="s2">usage in what they have meant in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">past my purpose here is to define them</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.350" end="00:00:29.939" style="s2">for maximum value for that to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">achieved the two have to be defined</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.939" end="00:00:34.440" style="s2">precisely such that they interact in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:38.489" style="s2">way to cover the territory to maximum</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.440" end="00:00:40.320" style="s2">effect let&#39;s talk a bit about adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.489" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">evolution we all tend to think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.320" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">evolution as about the past and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">there&#39;s good reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">but adaptive evolution occurs because it</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">prepares creatures to deal with future</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">environments the past cannot be changed</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">the future is where one&#39;s profits can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:57.270" style="s2">enhanced and ones cost can be reduced</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what evolution is about</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.270" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">when we think about sympathy and empathy</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:04.710" style="s2">it would be good for us to think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">them in that context let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.710" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">empathy human beings are very special</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">creatures far beyond any other creature</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">that has existed if we are programmed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">experiences that we have after we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">born one result of that is that one</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">human being and another may differ to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">great degree and this means that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">range of behavior may be quite wide at</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">the same time we are very highly social</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">creatures which means that our success</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">as human beings is largely dictated by</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">how well we interface with others of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">kind so in order to do that well it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">very valuable to be able to predict what</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">other people are going to think what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:48.570" style="s2">they will feel and ultimately what they</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">are going to do in response to changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.570" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">in their circumstances empathy is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:55.950" style="s2">very special evolved tool that we use to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">figure out what other people are going</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.950" end="00:02:02.060" style="s2">to do in response to changes in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">circumstance so if I&#39;m to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.060" end="00:02:07.590" style="s2">empathizing with you in order to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">empathize with you I run the data of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.590" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">your circumstance through my mind to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:15.630" style="s2">how I would feel if I was in your shoes</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:18.090" style="s2">if our minds are similar because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.630" end="00:02:20.430" style="s2">had similar developmental histories then</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.090" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">I may be very effective at this if our</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.430" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">minds are very different because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:25.560" style="s2">had very different developmental</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">trajectories then I may have nothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">more than a crude sketch it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:30.960" style="s2">probably better than nothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">but it&#39;s not going to be nearly as good</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.960" end="00:02:36.630" style="s2">as if you and I have shared a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">of history the value of my empathy with</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.630" end="00:02:41.490" style="s2">you however does not depend on whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">or not we&#39;re on the same team it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.490" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">important to understand one&#39;s enemies if</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">one is to defeat them just as it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">important to understand one&#39;s allies if</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">one is to aid them empathy does not pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">any heed to whether or not the person</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">that you are empathizing with is your</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">enemy or your ally now I&#39;ve spoken so</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">far as if empathy is a general capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">that two people have something like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.820" style="s2">coefficient that dictates how well they</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">can empathize with each other and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.820" end="00:03:12.510" style="s2">general that&#39;s probably true</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:14.580" style="s2">there are certainly going to be places</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.510" end="00:03:16.709" style="s2">though where two people can empathize to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.580" end="00:03:20.130" style="s2">a great degree but then fail in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.709" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">particular zone for example I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.130" end="00:03:25.890" style="s2">Los Angeles in the 1970s and 80s if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:27.750" style="s2">meet somebody else who grew up under</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.890" end="00:03:29.580" style="s2">similar circumstances in the same place</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.750" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">I may have a lot of insight into how</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">they&#39;re going to see the world but if</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">that person is female there may be some</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:38.610" style="s2">set of circumstances or events that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">understand less well because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.610" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">mirror my own experience the same can be</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:46.410" style="s2">said for generational differences if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">meet another biologist I may understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.410" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">a lot about how they see the world but</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:54.690" style="s2">if that biologist is a baby boomer then</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:56.940" style="s2">they grew up in boom times and and I did</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.690" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">not and that may affect the way we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.940" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">understand each other it is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">possible to bootstrap empathy where one</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">does not share developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:09.840" style="s2">circumstances with somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">extensive contact between two people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.840" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">are dissimilar can result in coming to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:17.910" style="s2">understand how the other person sees the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:21.329" style="s2">world this may also be why human beings</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.910" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">are obsessed with narratives we love</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.329" end="00:04:24.510" style="s2">movies and novels in large measure</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:26.729" style="s2">because they run us through</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.510" end="00:04:26.889" style="s2">circumstances that we will never face so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.729" end="00:04:28.930" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.889" end="00:04:31.960" style="s2">we can understand how characters in</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:34.330" style="s2">those circumstances see the world and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.960" end="00:04:36.069" style="s2">we ever run up against somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:37.689" style="s2">had a similar experience we may know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.069" end="00:04:40.810" style="s2">great deal more about it than we would</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.689" end="00:04:43.629" style="s2">otherwise scientific study can also</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">reveal such things behavioral scientists</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.629" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">in the last several decades have come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:49.330" style="s2">understand that contrary to most of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:51.249" style="s2">expectations</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.330" end="00:04:54.159" style="s2">human beings often value a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.249" end="00:04:55.960" style="s2">opportunity not an absolute terms how</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.159" end="00:04:58.060" style="s2">good is the opportunity but in relative</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.960" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">terms how good is that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.060" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">relative to what other people have</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">knowing that allows us to correct for</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">one of our expectations all right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:13.210" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about sympathy sympathy I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:16.029" style="s2">will argue is empathy plus alignment now</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.210" end="00:05:19.210" style="s2">this fits the etymology sympathy same</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.029" end="00:05:21.069" style="s2">pathos and what this means is that if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.210" end="00:05:23.169" style="s2">empathize with somebody so that I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.069" end="00:05:25.629" style="s2">the way in which they&#39;re likely to view</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.169" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">a particular circumstance and I also am</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.629" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">in alignment with them that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:32.469" style="s2">they are on my team then my emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:34.089" style="s2">experience at their plight is liable to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.469" end="00:05:37.839" style="s2">be parallel to their emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.089" end="00:05:41.529" style="s2">experience so it makes intuitive sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.839" end="00:05:43.599" style="s2">if I&#39;m watching a film of an enemy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.529" end="00:05:45.699" style="s2">mine and they are struggling to answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.599" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">questions from a hostile member of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.699" end="00:05:49.629" style="s2">press well then I can appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.210" style="s2">they are feeling terror and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.629" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">embarrassment but my emotional</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.210" end="00:05:56.169" style="s2">experience of watching them suffer</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:59.860" style="s2">through these things may be one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.169" end="00:06:01.689" style="s2">relief or even pleasure the German term</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.860" end="00:06:03.849" style="s2">schadenfreude comes to mind meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.689" end="00:06:07.180" style="s2">pleasure that one takes at somebody</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.849" end="00:06:08.469" style="s2">else&#39;s misfortune now if I&#39;m watching a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.180" end="00:06:11.229" style="s2">friend of mine face the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.469" end="00:06:13.240" style="s2">circumstance well then I am liable to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.229" end="00:06:15.310" style="s2">feel their terror and embarrassment</p>
