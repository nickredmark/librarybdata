<p begin="00:00:09.540" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">in the United States and this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.469" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">achieve world peace</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:20.689" style="s2">in our lifetime there are three</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">components to this one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.689" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">individually what we can do in groups</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:29.580" style="s2">what we can do as well as globally and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:32.700" style="s2">as always the global is a tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.580" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">cooperative solution so individually we</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:37.710" style="s2">can work on our own emotional</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">intelligence acknowledge when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">change their current circumstance a big</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.489" end="00:01:08.630" style="s2">way we can do that is in help is helping</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">people find and form groups because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.630" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">are social species and a lot of this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">easier when we&#39;re working in groups to</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.229" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">be able to deal with your own emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:24.259" style="s2">intelligence is one thing to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">have conversations in a group and help</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.259" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">ask for help in developing our emotional</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">where we&#39;re dominant and and then what</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">do we do about that do we do about those</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">emotions and to be able be able to find</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">groups is a piece of what a global tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:48.450" style="s2">cooperative can give us and the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">be able to effectively use those groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.450" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">on the global side in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">to tackle world peace we need to be</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">and war on our planet but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">things we can do with technology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:14.820" style="s2">probably honestly has already been done</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:17.460" style="s2">just need to find those apps final at</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.820" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">Beth&#39;s websites and make them widely</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.460" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">available and bring them together is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:25.770" style="s2">track or track every bombing every drone</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">strike every act of terrorism</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.770" end="00:02:29.460" style="s2">where did it happen how many people died</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">how do we know what happened there and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.460" end="00:02:34.410" style="s2">then from the thing that is black and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">white or more black and white we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.410" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">then look at the gray area who was</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">responsible if we don&#39;t know who did the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">drone strike do we know who made the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:44.100" style="s2">drone because that&#39;s what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.709" style="s2">tackle we need to the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.100" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">making money off of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.709" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">murdering each other in a systematic way</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">you need to be held accountable and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:55.770" style="s2">are made up of individuals who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">the best job they know how to do under</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.770" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">their current situation they are playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">a game of profit and it&#39;s costing us our</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">lives so we need to help them do better</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">which means if they&#39;re not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:08.580" style="s2">on their emotional intelligence we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">to hit them where they care which is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.580" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">their wallets so we need to track every</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:16.290" style="s2">dollar we need to track I don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">drones I don&#39;t buy bass weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.290" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">destruction and so I can&#39;t choose to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">spend that money more wisely somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">else but we can track every person that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">is a board member every person that is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">CFO CEO everyone who&#39;s a top shareholder</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:32.989" style="s2">we can see where else they spend their</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:36.060" style="s2">money and we can choose to boycott them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.989" end="00:03:38.700" style="s2">once we boycott those companies once we</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.060" end="00:03:39.720" style="s2">say and part a big piece of this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.700" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">something we could create tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.720" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">because we need to have alternatives if</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">I&#39;m spending my money in a company</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">because it&#39;s giving me value it&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">me something that I can afford it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">convenient it&#39;s the only place it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">monopoly in my life it&#39;s not as easy to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">switch to something else so when we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">offer people actual real alternatives to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:07.799" style="s2">the ones that are corrupt when we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:10.200" style="s2">show that they are corrupt then we give</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.799" end="00:04:10.920" style="s2">people an alternative just voting with</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.200" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">their money</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.920" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">in a way that promotes war and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:18.090" style="s2">environmental degradation and poverty so</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re also need to tackle all</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.090" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">of those things at once when people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">fed clothed sheltered have their</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:26.180" style="s2">education and their healthcare needs met</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">they have much more power to then</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.180" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">start voting with their dollar to choose</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:31.550" style="s2">where they are choosing to be employed</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:33.590" style="s2">because when your needs are met and your</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.550" end="00:04:35.509" style="s2">it&#39;s not about starvation why would you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.590" end="00:04:36.830" style="s2">go and work for someone who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
