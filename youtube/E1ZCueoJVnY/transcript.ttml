<p begin="00:02:16.900" end="00:02:24.580" style="s2">group and to be talking to Stoics is</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.580" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">of even get into what we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.510" end="00:02:31.930" style="s2">talking about I&#39;ve been a caregiver for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:35.080" style="s2">various sick people in my life and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">first time I had to do that Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.080" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">Aurelius and some of the other Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:44.950" style="s2">were key in helping me kind of bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:47.380" style="s2">over my Buddhism and get it in touch</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.950" end="00:02:52.900" style="s2">with my understanding of Western</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.380" end="00:02:56.920" style="s2">philosophy and also in just reminding me</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.900" end="00:03:01.510" style="s2">about the agency of tragedy and human</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.920" end="00:03:06.130" style="s2">complexity and that is kind of a species</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.510" end="00:03:10.540" style="s2">specific trait it is the grappling in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.130" end="00:03:12.190" style="s2">the reckoning with tragedy and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.540" end="00:03:16.750" style="s2">think the stoic philosophy is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.190" end="00:03:19.270" style="s2">those that can accommodate tragedy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.750" end="00:03:22.300" style="s2">transcend tragedy without denying</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.270" end="00:03:26.980" style="s2">tragedy which is exactly what has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.300" end="00:03:28.660" style="s2">have them now that Marcus Aurelius is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.980" end="00:03:31.000" style="s2">his diet that we are completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.660" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">interconnected to all things in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:36.580" style="s2">universe doesn&#39;t mean that the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.600" style="s2">right up next to us don&#39;t matter it just</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.580" end="00:03:38.860" style="s2">means that we can put them in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.600" end="00:03:42.880" style="s2">perspective so that we can deal with</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.860" end="00:03:44.050" style="s2">them in an appropriate way and so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.880" end="00:03:44.590" style="s2">of what I&#39;m hearing from spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.050" end="00:03:49.150" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.590" end="00:03:53.320" style="s2">is not correct</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.150" end="00:03:58.330" style="s2">you know the denial of tragedy the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.320" end="00:04:01.000" style="s2">denial of objective reality is part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.330" end="00:04:03.250" style="s2">the problem right now not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.000" end="00:04:05.860" style="s2">solution and so what we want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.250" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">people up and out of getting stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.860" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">the tragic and being incapacitated and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">overwhelmed by the situation we want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:15.970" style="s2">do that we want to liberate people from</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">their shallower concerns and from their</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.970" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">neurotic preoccupations that are making</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:21.760" style="s2">their suffering worse we want to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want to say things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.760" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">deny the tragedy of the actual situation</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">so and this is why I accepted to come to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:37.560" style="s2">a meeting of Stoics because suffering</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">pain these things are part of the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.560" end="00:04:46.110" style="s2">philosophy and also a kind of non</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:47.880" style="s2">escapist transcendence if I can put it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.110" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">that way and a non escapist</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.880" end="00:04:55.320" style="s2">transcendence if it&#39;s it to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">fully in the world but not of it which</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.320" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">is to say to act as an independent cause</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">and not only as the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:04.470" style="s2">cousins causes and conditions that put</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">you there right so this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.470" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">freedom and fate right and destiny these</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:16.169" style="s2">are all part of the stoic lexicon so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">happy to be here that&#39;s about where I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.169" end="00:05:20.550" style="s2">leave it you know what I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">paper is what I wanted to say at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.550" end="00:05:29.220" style="s2">moment about it and my sense is that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">know there&#39;s so much more to be said</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.220" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">right now I&#39;m in very close</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">communication and working and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">collaborating with people like Danish</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">Magdeburg and Jordan Hall we trying to</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:45.690" style="s2">infrastructure and a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.830" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">topics which you&#39;ve heard Jordan speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.690" end="00:05:51.240" style="s2">about at length and so I&#39;m not speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">into those domains I&#39;m trying to speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.240" end="00:05:58.040" style="s2">into the domains of the human and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:06:00.180" style="s2">especially into the kind of imminent</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.040" end="00:06:01.890" style="s2">mental health crisis for lack of a</p>

<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:07.650" style="s2">right so that&#39;s my urgency is there like</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.220" end="00:07:12.610" style="s2">remember it was like when it dawned on</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">me this was gonna be a big deal a couple</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.610" end="00:07:16.210" style="s2">weeks ago I couldn&#39;t really just</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:18.100" style="s2">cognitively process this this shutdown</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.210" end="00:07:20.260" style="s2">really I just kind of handed the keys to</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.100" end="00:07:21.820" style="s2">the what I call the Dame on that certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.260" end="00:07:24.460" style="s2">quality of intuition that says go here</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.820" end="00:07:26.650" style="s2">and then this project emerged and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.460" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">once I started to kind of we had like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.650" end="00:07:31.660" style="s2">about 20 events within 10 days and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:34.360" style="s2">starting to see this as sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.660" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">an incubator for cycle technology I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.360" end="00:07:37.630" style="s2">just inviting a lot of people just to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:39.850" style="s2">test stuff because you know the zoom is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.630" end="00:07:40.810" style="s2">a different framework and everything and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.850" end="00:07:42.550" style="s2">certain things are starting to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.810" end="00:07:44.050" style="s2">like we have the existential dance party</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.550" end="00:07:45.790" style="s2">we have like stoic breath like a wim HOF</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.050" end="00:07:49.780" style="s2">thing so it&#39;s like it&#39;s really cool and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.790" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">it feels it feels like alive so just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.780" end="00:07:53.530" style="s2">general question I guess personally for</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:55.300" style="s2">me and maybe for the rest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:57.910" style="s2">who are regulars here at the stoah is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.300" end="00:08:04.290" style="s2">any advice on how to go about this kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.910" end="00:08:06.700" style="s2">of psycho tech testing well I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.290" end="00:08:09.040" style="s2">one first thing is to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.700" end="00:08:12.340" style="s2">frames and think about the metaphors and</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.040" end="00:08:15.070" style="s2">so I think the psychological technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.340" end="00:08:16.930" style="s2">is a good metaphor but it&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.070" end="00:08:21.340" style="s2">my preferred metaphor because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.930" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">technology right and so I like to think</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.340" end="00:08:28.810" style="s2">about practice and ritual as such and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.110" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">technology is in the lower right so zoom</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.810" end="00:08:33.840" style="s2">is the technology in a sense it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:36.099" style="s2">aspheric technology right it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.840" end="00:08:38.680" style="s2">transmission of ideas and the internet</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.099" end="00:08:41.380" style="s2">and all of that so I see that as realms</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.680" end="00:08:43.240" style="s2">of technology which are in play but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.380" end="00:08:44.860" style="s2">things we&#39;re looking for are the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.240" end="00:08:48.190" style="s2">we do with our bodies and with our</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.860" end="00:08:50.840" style="s2">voices which are actually deeply organic</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.190" end="00:08:57.050" style="s2">and so I&#39;m actually looking for</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.840" end="00:09:00.650" style="s2">a return to the you know a return to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.050" end="00:09:03.470" style="s2">ritual of living together this is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.650" end="00:09:07.100" style="s2">we&#39;re asked to do in one sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.470" end="00:09:09.500" style="s2">it&#39;s in I&#39;m not against technology but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.100" end="00:09:12.230" style="s2">am against the idea that the human being</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.500" end="00:09:13.340" style="s2">works like a piece of technology or that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.230" end="00:09:16.430" style="s2">the mind works like a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.340" end="00:09:18.710" style="s2">technology so so that&#39;s one of my first</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.430" end="00:09:21.080" style="s2">things okay is it really a technology or</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.710" end="00:09:24.470" style="s2">is it for example something like a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.080" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">natural process right that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.470" end="00:09:30.950" style="s2">like a rediscovering right of an organic</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:34.910" style="s2">reality and always already exist in</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.950" end="00:09:37.430" style="s2">reality within the living body of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.910" end="00:09:39.830" style="s2">human within the bones and the DNA is</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.430" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">the possibility for the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.830" end="00:09:44.600" style="s2">consciousness that we are getting when</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:47.960" style="s2">we dance right or when we hold each</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.600" end="00:09:51.800" style="s2">other with the proper language so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.960" end="00:09:55.060" style="s2">looking for a certain kind of deepening</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.800" end="00:09:57.140" style="s2">into the always already present</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.060" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">capacities of the human organism that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.140" end="00:10:03.830" style="s2">are there and so meditation is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.670" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">the classic ones but dialogue oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.830" end="00:10:10.040" style="s2">another and then many of the rituals</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:14.870" style="s2">which we&#39;ve inherited from the great</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.040" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">traditions could be re potentiated and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.870" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">so I&#39;m thinking along those lines as</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:22.130" style="s2">well but when it comes to figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:27.590" style="s2">what works for a group or what works for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.130" end="00:10:32.470" style="s2">oneself then were in a delicate</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.590" end="00:10:35.540" style="s2">situation of self clarification and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.470" end="00:10:38.450" style="s2">basically having communities of practice</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.540" end="00:10:40.100" style="s2">right because the key thing at least for</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.450" end="00:10:43.250" style="s2">me and I think many Stokes would agree</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.100" end="00:10:47.660" style="s2">is not the subjective experience one has</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.250" end="00:10:50.660" style="s2">when doing a practice it is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.660" end="00:10:52.820" style="s2">practice conditions your choice right is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.660" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">the way the impact of that practice on</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.820" end="00:10:58.150" style="s2">your choice making its effect on others</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:58.150" style="s2">let&#39;s say so</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.230" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">if it makes you feel good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:05.880" style="s2">wonderful I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s bad but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:07.620" style="s2">I am saying that the the payload to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.880" end="00:11:11.310" style="s2">delivery what we&#39;re looking for at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.620" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">end of the day is a is a right action is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.310" end="00:11:18.360" style="s2">the condition for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:21.630" style="s2">right action and sometimes that will</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.360" end="00:11:24.330" style="s2">actually require going deeper into for</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.630" end="00:11:27.840" style="s2">example the pain that someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.330" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">experiencing right in order to say the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.840" end="00:11:32.370" style="s2">right thing to this person I need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">understand their interior state more I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.370" end="00:11:39.660" style="s2">need to understand their pain more right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:41.610" style="s2">that&#39;s intense it&#39;s a lot to ask but as</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.660" end="00:11:43.530" style="s2">a caregiver with a sick person you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.610" end="00:11:45.240" style="s2">to do that at times like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.530" end="00:11:46.740" style="s2">parent for a child you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.240" end="00:11:50.370" style="s2">understand what they&#39;re feeling in order</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.740" end="00:11:51.900" style="s2">to say the right thing and so and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.370" end="00:11:53.490" style="s2">isn&#39;t this is an ability that humans</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.900" end="00:11:55.860" style="s2">have to care for one another</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.490" end="00:11:59.100" style="s2">I think it&#39;s another species specific</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.860" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">trait right like other animals don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.100" end="00:12:05.070" style="s2">take care of their sick right humans</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:06.780" style="s2">take care of the sick it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.070" end="00:12:09.590" style="s2">like from a strictly Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.780" end="00:12:12.180" style="s2">perspective like that&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.590" end="00:12:14.040" style="s2">like if the universe runs the way Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.180" end="00:12:16.230" style="s2">said or Darwin in quotation marks to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.040" end="00:12:17.310" style="s2">kind of like fiction of Darwin that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.230" end="00:12:19.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve created because Darwin was</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.310" end="00:12:21.030" style="s2">actually much more complex but if it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.470" end="00:12:23.310" style="s2">runs that David Attenborough kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.030" end="00:12:24.210" style="s2">stereotypical Darwinian way then we</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.310" end="00:12:27.390" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be taking care of the sec</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.210" end="00:12:29.610" style="s2">right but we do right there&#39;s a implicit</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.390" end="00:12:34.590" style="s2">in the human and the being of us is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.610" end="00:12:37.650" style="s2">generosity and then Anna Karenina ghin</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.590" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">deepening empathy and doing the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.650" end="00:12:42.210" style="s2">practices not necessarily that make you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:44.130" style="s2">feel good although we need that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.210" end="00:12:46.700" style="s2">often these do make you feel good so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.130" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">there it&#39;s not mutually exclusive at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.700" end="00:12:51.660" style="s2">but the practices that allow you to to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.400" style="s2">do the right thing to be the person you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.660" end="00:12:55.860" style="s2">need to be to say what needs to be said</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.400" end="00:12:58.470" style="s2">and so that&#39;s about clarifying who you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.860" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">are clarifying the realities in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.470" end="00:13:06.300" style="s2">field of your experience and it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:07.740" style="s2">gets harder to do that as the realities</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.300" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">in the field of your experience become</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.740" end="00:13:13.470" style="s2">more intense or</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">more unpredictable more frightening and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.470" end="00:13:16.770" style="s2">so this is where all the tricks we</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">learned from stoicism Buddhism and other</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.770" end="00:13:22.680" style="s2">things to regulate into ground right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:29.160" style="s2">allows you to then experiment with other</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.680" end="00:13:32.220" style="s2">practices like slowing down that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:38.520" style="s2">good one reflecting that&#39;s another good</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.220" end="00:13:39.720" style="s2">one so yeah a lot of so that that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.520" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">not really a great answer if it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.720" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">of like rambling in the in the area</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:45.180" style="s2">where you asked the question because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:47.540" style="s2">not I can&#39;t give specific advice</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.180" end="00:13:49.650" style="s2">everyone&#39;s in a very unique situation</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.540" end="00:13:52.920" style="s2">you know the most general things you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.650" end="00:13:59.010" style="s2">say are to take care of yourself and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.920" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">- yeah to take care of yourself and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.010" end="00:14:07.590" style="s2">curious how you personally are taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:09.960" style="s2">care of yourself interesting it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.590" end="00:14:12.180" style="s2">complicated question I mean I&#39;ve been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.960" end="00:14:17.480" style="s2">caregiver for many years like over a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.180" end="00:14:20.580" style="s2">decade so I was already in a routine of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.480" end="00:14:23.850" style="s2">having to step in to other people&#39;s pain</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.580" end="00:14:26.280" style="s2">to be able to support them right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.850" end="00:14:27.960" style="s2">then to not get so caught up in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.280" end="00:14:30.540" style="s2">pain that then I destroy myself so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.960" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">already had some balance in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.540" end="00:14:37.710" style="s2">psychologically but believe me it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:40.290" style="s2">hard one so the basics you know eating</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.710" end="00:14:45.060" style="s2">right trying to exercise and do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.290" end="00:14:47.910" style="s2">movement sleeping right I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.060" end="00:14:50.340" style="s2">strict media diet which is to say I have</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.910" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">a limited amount of time that I look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.340" end="00:14:59.610" style="s2">the media every day and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">so I get out of the infinite scroll the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.610" end="00:15:05.610" style="s2">infinite scroll is a hyper stimuli in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:07.080" style="s2">technical evolutionary sense which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.610" end="00:15:09.240" style="s2">that there was I don&#39;t know how big the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.080" end="00:15:12.300" style="s2">Library of Alexandria was but it was not</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:13.590" style="s2">as big as ant-man so no matter how much</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.300" end="00:15:15.840" style="s2">you wanted to scroll through the Library</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.590" end="00:15:19.000" style="s2">of Alexandria so there&#39;s this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.840" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">just that is very disorienting</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.000" end="00:15:23.470" style="s2">scroll and we have in all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:25.630" style="s2">change to a social media environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.470" end="00:15:27.370" style="s2">where they aren&#39;t banking money off of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.630" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">us by selling us advertisements right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.370" end="00:15:31.750" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t happened like Facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:32.890" style="s2">still basically incentivized to keep you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.750" end="00:15:34.630" style="s2">paying attention to sell your</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.890" end="00:15:37.420" style="s2">advertisements sorry guys</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.630" end="00:15:40.780" style="s2">so there&#39;s still a systemic disruption</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.420" end="00:15:43.690" style="s2">of your infinite scroll in such a way as</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.780" end="00:15:45.490" style="s2">to give you disorienting information so</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.690" end="00:15:47.770" style="s2">you can&#39;t make a cohesive story and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.490" end="00:15:50.290" style="s2">leave time just so you know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.770" end="00:15:51.760" style="s2">they studied the human nervous system to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:53.710" style="s2">dick people to Facebook to sell them</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.760" end="00:15:56.320" style="s2">appetize months and we use Facebook like</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.710" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">we&#39;re saving the world with it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.320" end="00:16:01.960" style="s2">the first step is unplug from that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:03.790" style="s2">and plug into deeper long-form stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.960" end="00:16:07.210" style="s2">specifically conversations people you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.790" end="00:16:11.170" style="s2">know all right we need to be together</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.210" end="00:16:13.330" style="s2">with the people who we love and away</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.170" end="00:16:14.680" style="s2">from the screens now sometimes we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.330" end="00:16:16.090" style="s2">the screen to get us to that person that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.680" end="00:16:17.710" style="s2">we love but that&#39;s a different when</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.090" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">you&#39;re having 45 minutes zoom call with</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.710" end="00:16:24.400" style="s2">somebody so I protect myself from</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:26.620" style="s2">oversaturation of the media environment</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.400" end="00:16:29.370" style="s2">we gen limited amount of time every day</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.620" end="00:16:33.100" style="s2">and not simply not participating on</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.370" end="00:16:39.089" style="s2">social media in the standard ways so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.100" end="00:16:41.110" style="s2">that&#39;s one good tip you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.089" end="00:16:42.310" style="s2">you know beginning in those</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.110" end="00:16:45.160" style="s2">conversations that I have with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.310" end="00:16:47.640" style="s2">people that I love beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.160" end="00:16:51.540" style="s2">beginning the difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:54.330" style="s2">right having the difficult conversations</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.540" end="00:16:59.380" style="s2">and there&#39;s many of those right money</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.330" end="00:17:03.520" style="s2">right health death right these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.380" end="00:17:05.380" style="s2">are now just like in the air and so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.520" end="00:17:08.140" style="s2">degree to which you try to get along and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.380" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">pretend like they&#39;re not makes it hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.140" end="00:17:12.579" style="s2">we need to clear that space mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">have a difficult conversation in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.579" end="00:17:18.010" style="s2">before you have to write and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:20.020" style="s2">can create a safe container in which to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.010" end="00:17:21.890" style="s2">love one another and to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.020" end="00:17:24.709" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.890" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">and so again hard hard-won lessons from</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.709" end="00:17:28.910" style="s2">difficult times but it&#39;s necessary the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">difficult conversations happening you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.910" end="00:17:32.750" style="s2">need to trust yourself and the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:36.320" style="s2">people that you can get through those</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.750" end="00:17:37.430" style="s2">conversations so that&#39;s important and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.320" end="00:17:39.710" style="s2">you need help having that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.430" end="00:17:41.330" style="s2">seek help it&#39;s often hard to work that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.710" end="00:17:43.100" style="s2">stuff out one-on-one and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.330" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">probably someone around you who loves</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:48.860" style="s2">right and there&#39;s going to be people</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.280" end="00:17:50.660" style="s2">popping up trying to give these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.860" end="00:17:52.570" style="s2">supports all over the place I&#39;m seeing</p>

<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:18:01.250" style="s2">a whole bunch of coaches and therapists</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.970" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">and other people and counselors trying</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.250" end="00:18:06.530" style="s2">to find ways up and into people to get</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">of dynamics so I kind of am of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.490" end="00:18:17.690" style="s2">attitude of yeah you know kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:20.540" style="s2">know embrace the suck right nothing at</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.690" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">Jamie real said that and be in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.540" end="00:18:24.650" style="s2">tragedy the post tragic was in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:27.410" style="s2">tragedy post tragic didn&#39;t find a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.650" end="00:18:29.300" style="s2">out of the tragedy post tragic is right</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.410" end="00:18:33.050" style="s2">in a burning in it burning in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.300" end="00:18:35.600" style="s2">tragedy but not only the tragedy right</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.050" end="00:18:37.820" style="s2">and so usually when you can have these</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.600" end="00:18:41.000" style="s2">conversations and you can clear right</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.820" end="00:18:43.460" style="s2">then you can touch transcendence without</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.000" end="00:18:46.250" style="s2">denying the world and that&#39;s what needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.460" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">to happen that&#39;s that&#39;s those are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.250" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">liberating moments that you can find</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:54.230" style="s2">even in pain and illness and sickness so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:57.470" style="s2">so that&#39;s some of what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.230" end="00:19:02.030" style="s2">trying to have the conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.470" end="00:19:03.970" style="s2">need to be had which is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.030" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">things we&#39;re being called to do you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.970" end="00:19:08.150" style="s2">we&#39;re all working from home is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:09.860" style="s2">notion of like we&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.150" end="00:19:11.390" style="s2">having our old job from home but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.860" end="00:19:13.850" style="s2">actually forgot to work that used to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.390" end="00:19:19.300" style="s2">done in the home it&#39;s different nice if</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.850" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the work of being in a home and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.300" end="00:19:23.840" style="s2">some of the most difficult work actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:25.640" style="s2">which is why most people prefer to leave</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.840" end="00:19:27.680" style="s2">the home and go work pretend like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.640" end="00:19:29.960" style="s2">the most important thing that the sand</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.680" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">castles were building right which are so</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.960" end="00:19:32.020" style="s2">fragile as we&#39;re seeing these sand</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:34.270" style="s2">castles</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.020" end="00:19:36.190" style="s2">don&#39;t write or not as important as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.270" end="00:19:40.750" style="s2">work we&#39;re doing right here every day</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.190" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">right around the table and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:47.110" style="s2">where we&#39;re returning to and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">many of us are fortunate enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.110" end="00:19:52.090" style="s2">that table in a safe place but not</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:52.900" style="s2">everyone has a table in the safe place</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.090" end="00:19:56.230" style="s2">where they can have these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.900" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">so we need to put ourselves in context</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.230" end="00:20:01.720" style="s2">get our shit together and then start</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.670" style="s2">collaborating in a way that we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.720" end="00:20:06.670" style="s2">seen basically so that&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.670" end="00:20:09.250" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do I&#39;m trying to as part</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.670" end="00:20:11.020" style="s2">of my practice just work a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.250" end="00:20:12.490" style="s2">harder and have more conversations than</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.020" end="00:20:17.860" style="s2">I would normally have and kind of move</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.490" end="00:20:20.140" style="s2">things forward in a in as Unseld finta</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.860" end="00:20:22.870" style="s2">rest of the way as as possible in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.140" end="00:20:25.830" style="s2">where I&#39;m basically trying to be what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.870" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">needed in the moment and again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.830" end="00:20:31.420" style="s2">focus ISM ride them trying to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:37.510" style="s2">to clear what Zach might want and figure</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.420" end="00:20:41.110" style="s2">out what the world needs and again</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.510" end="00:20:43.150" style="s2">things hard hard thought hard one from</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.110" end="00:20:44.800" style="s2">happy basically forced into being a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.150" end="00:20:48.370" style="s2">caregiver so for so many years myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.800" end="00:20:52.810" style="s2">did you figure out out of me what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.370" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">moment needs and so this is it over or</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.810" end="00:20:57.130" style="s2">call to do and then other things too</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">like once you clear the air and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.130" end="00:21:00.820" style="s2">in the tragedy but you&#39;re transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:02.890" style="s2">but still minute right then you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.820" end="00:21:05.860" style="s2">laugh again then you have post tragic</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.890" end="00:21:08.410" style="s2">laughter you can have post tragic tears</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.860" end="00:21:10.420" style="s2">that are not self-interested what was me</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.410" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">tears that are tears for the world right</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.420" end="00:21:16.810" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a humor</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.710" end="00:21:18.970" style="s2">possible there&#39;s a levity that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.810" end="00:21:20.620" style="s2">possible but it has to be the levity on</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.970" end="00:21:22.540" style="s2">the other side of tragedy it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.620" end="00:21:25.550" style="s2">the levity before we actually confront</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.540" end="00:21:26.990" style="s2">it right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.550" end="00:21:28.280" style="s2">I&#39;ll share having a very important</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.990" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">practice for me all these years was</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.280" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">watching America&#39;s money zone videos you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:33.170" style="s2">guys know America&#39;s find somebody yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.760" end="00:21:34.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like the looks like very lowest</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.170" end="00:21:39.260" style="s2">counted I&#39;m they&#39;re like people falling</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:41.000" style="s2">off the trampolines kind of stuff but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.260" end="00:21:42.800" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t laugh it was so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.000" end="00:21:44.450" style="s2">laugh sometimes because of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.800" end="00:21:46.430" style="s2">dealing with and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.450" end="00:21:48.830" style="s2">someone&#39;s little banana peel you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.430" end="00:21:52.310" style="s2">what I mean like so we need to remember</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.830" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">those things too and allow ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.310" end="00:22:00.350" style="s2">do that as well you know and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.070" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">important too which is once you&#39;re in it</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.350" end="00:22:05.420" style="s2">and you admit that you&#39;re that and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:08.630" style="s2">are dealing with it sentient but within</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.420" end="00:22:11.750" style="s2">it then you can find love and laughter</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.630" end="00:22:13.400" style="s2">and things even within tragedy and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.750" end="00:22:16.970" style="s2">know this again from human experience in</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.400" end="00:22:19.330" style="s2">history right that wars are terrible but</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.970" end="00:22:23.540" style="s2">within the midst of war there is love</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.330" end="00:22:26.150" style="s2">and even more intense and profound love</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.540" end="00:22:29.090" style="s2">that happens in times of peace because</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.150" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">of what because of what demands of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:37.700" style="s2">anima Mundi are making right the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:45.400" style="s2">soul and transformation so yeah I said</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.700" end="00:22:48.260" style="s2">yeah eat right gonna eat right yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.400" end="00:22:53.390" style="s2">whole metaphor that really really landed</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.260" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">for me I like that a lot so let&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.390" end="00:22:59.960" style="s2">it up to questions I&#39;ll unmute you when</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:03.260" style="s2">I call your name</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.960" end="00:23:04.610" style="s2">so Terry Patton um you had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.260" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">things a couple questions I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.610" end="00:23:08.110" style="s2">unmute you so you can ask that to Zach</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.770" end="00:23:20.980" style="s2">you know in in your essays Zach so much</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.210" end="00:23:24.620" style="s2">sobriety and even in a kind of sternness</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.980" end="00:23:28.130" style="s2">regarding the high probability of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.620" end="00:23:29.900" style="s2">personal moral failures in this war in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.130" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">heaven between our better and darker</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.900" end="00:23:41.110" style="s2">angels and I think implicit</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">there are some forms that this might</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.110" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">take that our most prominent when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:50.049" style="s2">wrote the essay and your awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:54.029" style="s2">also maybe least likely to be obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.049" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">others and I&#39;d like to invite you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.029" end="00:24:04.330" style="s2">reflect and elaborate hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:07.380" style="s2">right I mean in a sense I was writing to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.330" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">several different kind of echelon right</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.380" end="00:24:15.820" style="s2">some of what we&#39;re seeing at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:19.240" style="s2">levels of decision-making is hard to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.820" end="00:24:21.730" style="s2">explain which is why we&#39;re getting so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.240" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">much conspiracy theory right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.730" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the highest levels of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:27.970" style="s2">decision-making in political life not</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:32.070" style="s2">just like in the last few weeks but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.970" end="00:24:34.809" style="s2">for a couple decades and you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.070" end="00:24:36.399" style="s2">how did this how how did we get in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.809" end="00:24:40.090" style="s2">situation these were human just making</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.399" end="00:24:42.340" style="s2">choices over time and so when you think</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.090" end="00:24:45.190" style="s2">about the war in heaven you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.340" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">about what are the ideals that our</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.190" end="00:24:50.889" style="s2">leaders have lived by that allowed a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:52.809" style="s2">society like this to exist when was the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.889" end="00:24:55.539" style="s2">choice made in their subjectivity to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.809" end="00:25:00.309" style="s2">align themselves with an ideal for</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.539" end="00:25:05.159" style="s2">Humanity as opposed to another right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.309" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">one stratum writing to people was just</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.159" end="00:25:12.010" style="s2">you know the power right and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:14.110" style="s2">corruption of power and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.010" end="00:25:17.010" style="s2">now that the world has come on patterned</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.110" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">the possibility for power plays is</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.010" end="00:25:23.350" style="s2">ridiculously big right so who is driving</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:24.669" style="s2">which truck through this huge opening</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.350" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">into the future of infrastructure in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.669" end="00:25:29.590" style="s2">economics and mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:33.610" style="s2">education and biometrics trying who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.590" end="00:25:36.370" style="s2">driving through that and so part of me</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.610" end="00:25:38.500" style="s2">is writing to that and saying like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.370" end="00:25:41.500" style="s2">got the devil on your shoulder right but</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.500" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">there&#39;s an angel too and so at that</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.500" end="00:25:47.350" style="s2">highest level there&#39;s this possibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">for either get off the stage if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.350" end="00:25:51.720" style="s2">can&#39;t do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:54.790" style="s2">or realign yourself at a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.720" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">and then for the everyday right for the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.790" end="00:26:00.010" style="s2">salt of the earth this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:02.050" style="s2">basic orientation of selfishness persons</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.010" end="00:26:05.620" style="s2">care as far as I can see it right and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.050" end="00:26:06.850" style="s2">separation versus approach and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.620" end="00:26:09.370" style="s2">sense I&#39;m writing to all the people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.850" end="00:26:11.980" style="s2">took way too much toilet paper right</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.370" end="00:26:13.270" style="s2">it&#39;s like just check yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.980" end="00:26:15.790" style="s2">because what happened is the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.270" end="00:26:19.510" style="s2">opened up and all of the horrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.790" end="00:26:22.929" style="s2">scenarios flooded in and they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.510" end="00:26:23.920" style="s2">control the most base instinct which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.929" end="00:26:26.950" style="s2">self-protection</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.920" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">now why toilet paper I don&#39;t know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.950" end="00:26:30.600" style="s2">not good enough psychologist right but</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.960" end="00:26:32.740" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the root chakra</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.600" end="00:26:34.780" style="s2">something about the root chakra and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:37.570" style="s2">something about this stuff we have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.780" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">our lives going on we don&#39;t want anyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.570" end="00:26:41.470" style="s2">else to see which now may become</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:46.540" style="s2">apparent because everything&#39;s being on</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.470" end="00:26:48.610" style="s2">patterned right and so at the more base</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.540" end="00:26:50.380" style="s2">level I&#39;m just thinking about what world</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.610" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">do it because I&#39;m not like a hyper agent</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.380" end="00:26:55.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not someone making massive decisions</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.320" end="00:26:56.890" style="s2">affecting the future of infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.030" end="00:27:00.580" style="s2">and commodity supply chains and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.890" end="00:27:01.780" style="s2">healthcare but I am making decisions on</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.580" end="00:27:04.750" style="s2">a day-to-day basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.780" end="00:27:07.120" style="s2">right and it&#39;s the question of when am i</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:09.010" style="s2">choosing out of a basic orientation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.120" end="00:27:12.520" style="s2">separation and selfishness and what am i</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.010" end="00:27:18.700" style="s2">choosing basically to lead with love and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.520" end="00:27:20.770" style="s2">care and concern and so far okay thank</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.700" end="00:27:22.179" style="s2">God it&#39;s I&#39;ve been able to make I feel</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.770" end="00:27:24.160" style="s2">the right choice and I can go to bed at</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.179" end="00:27:26.740" style="s2">night feeling good that I haven&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.160" end="00:27:29.470" style="s2">someone worse as a result of being put</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.740" end="00:27:32.380" style="s2">in a more difficult situation right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.470" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s the basic request is that as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.380" end="00:27:38.710" style="s2">situation gets more difficult can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:41.050" style="s2">continue to be who you want to be can</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.710" end="00:27:43.630" style="s2">you continue to be committed to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.050" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">things that allow you to be an interest</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.630" end="00:27:48.210" style="s2">person and after a real someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:51.869" style="s2">committed to your ideals</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.210" end="00:27:53.909" style="s2">and so yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.869" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that knife edge basically and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.909" end="00:27:57.210" style="s2">that&#39;s the battle in heavens actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:59.999" style="s2">this battle in the imaginal realms and</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.210" end="00:28:01.559" style="s2">our own minds between different possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.999" end="00:28:04.769" style="s2">selves right these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.559" end="00:28:07.110" style="s2">trajectories of choice that&#39;s seen</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.769" end="00:28:10.110" style="s2">people in difficult situations who get</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.110" end="00:28:13.019" style="s2">in the kind of a choice cascade of bad</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.110" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">choices of a choice cascade of selfless</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.019" end="00:28:17.429" style="s2">choices and then you end up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.700" style="s2">situation becomes much worse than</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.429" end="00:28:24.869" style="s2">already was because now you were like</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.700" end="00:28:26.580" style="s2">overwhelmed by your own inability to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.869" end="00:28:28.409" style="s2">the person you wanted to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.580" end="00:28:34.889" style="s2">difficult situation and so there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.409" end="00:28:37.619" style="s2">this there&#39;s just a primacy on trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.889" end="00:28:39.210" style="s2">give people the capacity to be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.619" end="00:28:41.730" style="s2">person that they did they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.210" end="00:28:43.559" style="s2">visco so I&#39;m trying to do in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.730" end="00:28:47.009" style="s2">essay and so I didn&#39;t have particular I</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.559" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">mean bad actions are in mind it was just</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.009" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen this choice point and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.080" end="00:28:57.480" style="s2">yeah and I but it&#39;s also that I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.990" end="00:29:00.600" style="s2">the scales are tipped toward the light</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.480" end="00:29:02.600" style="s2">if I can say that yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.600" end="00:29:07.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of reasons to think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.600" end="00:29:11.610" style="s2">but interesting research on both both</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.889" end="00:29:14.700" style="s2">post-traumatic growth as a profound</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.610" end="00:29:16.710" style="s2">possibility within humans and research</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.700" end="00:29:20.549" style="s2">on what happens with people what happens</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.710" end="00:29:24.990" style="s2">in natural disaster situations just</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.549" end="00:29:26.999" style="s2">spontaneous emergence of care giver like</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.990" end="00:29:28.259" style="s2">people who used to hate one another the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.999" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">hurricane comes and now he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.259" end="00:29:31.529" style="s2">pulling the guy out of his house on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:33.299" style="s2">raft kind of thing you don&#39;t even like</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.529" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">those words you see on the news of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.299" end="00:29:37.619" style="s2">terrible horrible stories but most of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:40.619" style="s2">what happens behind the scenes in those</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.619" end="00:29:44.730" style="s2">kind of events is people doing quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.619" end="00:29:47.399" style="s2">extraordinary stuff and so the more of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.730" end="00:29:50.220" style="s2">that happens the more that&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.399" end="00:29:53.490" style="s2">happen and so I&#39;m imagining a grassroots</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.220" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">that&#39;s made of good choice making which</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.490" end="00:29:58.820" style="s2">allows as the going gets tough to tip</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:02.060" style="s2">the balance which is all I&#39;m seeking as</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.820" end="00:30:04.250" style="s2">while one would save the day because</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.060" end="00:30:07.250" style="s2">we&#39;re in a tragedy but to tip the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.250" end="00:30:08.630" style="s2">balance so that in the long run a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.250" end="00:30:12.950" style="s2">people can look back on what has</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.630" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">happened and be like whoa that was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.950" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">I am a better person for it even though</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">I may have suffered more than I thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:22.760" style="s2">it was possible to suffer or been more</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:25.610" style="s2">courageous than I thought it was I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.760" end="00:30:29.060" style="s2">possible for me or or whatever right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.610" end="00:30:33.710" style="s2">it&#39;s that moral fortitude how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.060" end="00:30:38.000" style="s2">that in a post treated culture you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.710" end="00:30:41.500" style="s2">mind just a brief follow-up I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.000" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">aware that I&#39;m in relative comfort and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.500" end="00:30:48.260" style="s2">in this enforced retreat that gives me</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:50.750" style="s2">space to be reflective but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.260" end="00:30:52.730" style="s2">future moments it&#39;ll perhaps be much</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.750" end="00:30:56.030" style="s2">more binding and much more challenging</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.730" end="00:30:59.680" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a kind of work in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.030" end="00:31:04.070" style="s2">anticipation of a squeeze that might be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.680" end="00:31:08.150" style="s2">incumbent upon us right now and a kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.070" end="00:31:11.390" style="s2">of as much as you know decades and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.150" end="00:31:13.700" style="s2">decades of spiritual practice in so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.390" end="00:31:17.000" style="s2">different ways I&#39;ve intended to dedicate</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.700" end="00:31:19.060" style="s2">my life toward the good but this</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.000" end="00:31:24.130" style="s2">interruption</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.060" end="00:31:26.650" style="s2">asks for what ever I&#39;ve known to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.130" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">recognized as provisional and something</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.650" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">more to be possible and so I can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:38.050" style="s2">for granted the wisdom I&#39;ve already in</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:41.019" style="s2">integrated as sufficient and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.050" end="00:31:43.269" style="s2">an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.019" end="00:31:47.529" style="s2">kind of not knowing and listening and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.269" end="00:31:51.070" style="s2">just openness of course but perhaps a</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.529" end="00:31:54.460" style="s2">more radical kind of preparation and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.070" end="00:31:58.149" style="s2">curious yeah I think it&#39;s good to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.460" end="00:32:00.909" style="s2">thinking that way so people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.149" end="00:32:02.889" style="s2">how like oh well there could be another</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.909" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">way of infections in the fall right</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.889" end="00:32:08.259" style="s2">because this is how the 1918 pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:11.739" style="s2">went right and so whether or not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.259" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">true biologically there&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.739" end="00:32:17.070" style="s2">truth to the fact that psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:21.759" style="s2">this fall is going to be difficult right</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.070" end="00:32:28.379" style="s2">that right now we are in anxious kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.759" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">like shocked and like primed right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.379" end="00:32:34.059" style="s2">losses happen about all kinds of loss</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:35.859" style="s2">investments of time and energy and all</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.059" end="00:32:37.749" style="s2">these things are now and so cost is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.859" end="00:32:40.179" style="s2">happening so you can look at the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.749" end="00:32:43.089" style="s2">cycles of those things as a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.179" end="00:32:45.399" style="s2">you see that it takes time for those</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.089" end="00:32:47.259" style="s2">kinds of events to sink in and things</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.399" end="00:32:49.119" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole poem right</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.259" end="00:32:53.349" style="s2">there&#39;s like it there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.119" end="00:32:55.929" style="s2">depressive breakdown and so what we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.349" end="00:32:57.999" style="s2">to do now is basically build networks of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.929" end="00:32:59.739" style="s2">connections social relationships which</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.999" end="00:33:01.330" style="s2">is want to thank Ock the people you love</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.739" end="00:33:02.919" style="s2">and expand that circle of people that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.330" end="00:33:06.969" style="s2">you love and the concreteness of both</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.919" end="00:33:09.999" style="s2">conversations so that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.969" end="00:33:13.960" style="s2">there to catch us all when when the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.999" end="00:33:17.559" style="s2">going gets hard or harder as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.960" end="00:33:19.119" style="s2">saying Terry and God let it not be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.559" end="00:33:21.700" style="s2">case that it gets harder right like God</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.119" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">let us be overacting please but perf</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.700" end="00:33:25.450" style="s2">let&#39;s prepare just in case and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:28.830" style="s2">preparation would be to build those</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.450" end="00:33:33.219" style="s2">networks to have those conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.830" end="00:33:35.320" style="s2">to you know be conscious like be</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.219" end="00:33:37.749" style="s2">explicit like hey we&#39;re connecting now</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.320" end="00:33:39.099" style="s2">and it could get harder and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.749" end="00:33:40.929" style="s2">there for you and you&#39;ll be there for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.099" end="00:33:43.719" style="s2">and those things those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.929" end="00:33:45.879" style="s2">matter more now than they ever did and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.719" end="00:33:49.179" style="s2">knowing that you&#39;ve got to couple people</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.879" end="00:33:51.350" style="s2">right three or four people maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.179" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">you&#39;re lucky about more right</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.350" end="00:33:57.500" style="s2">we&#39;ll be there and to talk to you like</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:34:02.030" style="s2">that&#39;s so important so the main thing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.500" end="00:34:04.100" style="s2">not to me like some fancy meditation</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.030" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">practice or some fancy prayer practice</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.100" end="00:34:09.080" style="s2">or anything like it&#39;s not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:13.070" style="s2">actually something about community and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.080" end="00:34:15.290" style="s2">relationship and those conversations</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.070" end="00:34:17.480" style="s2">that get us in touch with the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.290" end="00:34:20.540" style="s2">realities that are here on earth right</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.480" end="00:34:24.530" style="s2">or two realities of love and realities</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.540" end="00:34:27.649" style="s2">of vision and imagination right and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.530" end="00:34:29.030" style="s2">so to just see those we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.649" end="00:34:32.419" style="s2">together and we have to start getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.030" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">comfortable being more or intimate even</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.419" end="00:34:39.530" style="s2">though we&#39;re in fact physically</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:42.790" style="s2">distanced so that would be my my prepper</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.530" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">God would be you know I&#39;m not like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.790" end="00:34:46.760" style="s2">prepper like stockpile food and all that</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.129" style="s2">stuff I&#39;m like that&#39;s not really gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.760" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">matter right if you don&#39;t have community</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.129" end="00:34:53.060" style="s2">and relationship and the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:55.609" style="s2">with people there&#39;s no escape hatch</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.060" end="00:34:57.109" style="s2">right and this is this is a shout out to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.609" end="00:34:58.940" style="s2">like the really wealthy people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.109" end="00:35:01.490" style="s2">no escape match right there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.940" end="00:35:04.850" style="s2">no place you can bug out right every</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.490" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">sketch at escape hatch goes deeper in to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.850" end="00:35:10.220" style="s2">some kind of intensity of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.500" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">and culture right so so just we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.220" end="00:35:17.960" style="s2">realize that we&#39;re in it all together</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:18.859" style="s2">and so yeah you know go out stand ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.960" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">feet away and talk to your neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.859" end="00:35:24.010" style="s2">right to figure out who&#39;s around and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.070" end="00:35:31.700" style="s2">that would be my recommendation as far</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:35.390" style="s2">as preparing for the emotional for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.700" end="00:35:39.290" style="s2">emotional kind of journey that were</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.390" end="00:35:43.490" style="s2">headed for Thank You Terry it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.290" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">see you there so I&#39;m going to call on</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.490" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">Ashley Ashley I will unmute you hello so</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:59.930" style="s2">I am an educator and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:04.220" style="s2">what are some what are some actionable</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.930" end="00:36:05.060" style="s2">steps I can take in bringing my students</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.220" end="00:36:08.360" style="s2">up to speed</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.060" end="00:36:10.310" style="s2">but moreover I I have connections with</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.360" end="00:36:12.410" style="s2">our local mayor and so the other day I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.310" end="00:36:15.800" style="s2">was thinking like I used to have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.410" end="00:36:18.500" style="s2">conversation with the mayor what does</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.800" end="00:36:23.320" style="s2">that conversation look like in this time</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.500" end="00:36:26.330" style="s2">and space without turning him off - the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.320" end="00:36:28.520" style="s2">transitions that I see forming and at</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.330" end="00:36:31.060" style="s2">the opportune time to have those</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.520" end="00:36:34.550" style="s2">conversations mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.060" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">interesting I mean as an educator as</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.550" end="00:36:41.720" style="s2">well I&#39;m somewhat biased but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:44.570" style="s2">conversation with the mayor is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">conversation about the kids right like</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.570" end="00:36:47.470" style="s2">because other people having</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">conversations with the mayor about like</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.470" end="00:36:51.700" style="s2">testing and quarantine procedure and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:55.940" style="s2">hand-washing and all that stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.700" end="00:36:58.190" style="s2">but for me as a psychologist educator</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.940" end="00:37:00.410" style="s2">again the main event is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.190" end="00:37:02.540" style="s2">right now to the kids like everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.410" end="00:37:05.210" style="s2">affected but there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.540" end="00:37:09.350" style="s2">developmental transitions particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.210" end="00:37:11.060" style="s2">adolescents where this is like a not</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.350" end="00:37:12.830" style="s2">great to be in that lesson right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.060" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">like it&#39;s like it&#39;s terrible to be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.830" end="00:37:17.060" style="s2">vulnerable old person this is correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:19.670" style="s2">but from an identity formation</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.060" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">perspective front right the people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.670" end="00:37:23.870" style="s2">are forming their adult identities now</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:26.120" style="s2">under these life conditions are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.870" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">leaders of the future and will determine</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.120" end="00:37:32.840" style="s2">what happens ten years from them right</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:35.450" style="s2">right and it may be given the history of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.840" end="00:37:37.490" style="s2">civil unrest globally they may be</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.450" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">determining what happens just a few</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.490" end="00:37:42.470" style="s2">months from now right we have to look at</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:44.420" style="s2">Maoism and Nazism and you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.470" end="00:37:47.150" style="s2">growth of massive civil unrest movements</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.420" end="00:37:51.290" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at disenfranchised</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.150" end="00:37:56.020" style="s2">adolescent or early adult males and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.290" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge need to focus on creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.020" end="00:38:02.390" style="s2">resources and opportunities for</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:05.720" style="s2">adolescents to do work that&#39;s not rote</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.390" end="00:38:06.530" style="s2">being a school work that is work that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.720" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">makes them feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.530" end="00:38:11.810" style="s2">contributing to their communities so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:14.550" style="s2">like interview projects with teams of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.810" end="00:38:17.070" style="s2">adolescents and old people</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.550" end="00:38:19.110" style="s2">have stories to share like is huge I</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.070" end="00:38:22.860" style="s2">think those forms of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.110" end="00:38:25.980" style="s2">transmission other things that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.860" end="00:38:29.010" style="s2">adolescents can do to feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.980" end="00:38:33.450" style="s2">creative right co-creating videos that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.010" end="00:38:35.010" style="s2">talk to their experience or I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.450" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">saying we can&#39;t be thinking about how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.010" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">get these kids prepared for college all</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:40.590" style="s2">right that&#39;s not now it&#39;s all the time</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.540" style="s2">for that now it&#39;s the time to help them</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.590" end="00:38:45.560" style="s2">through the coming months and to give</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.540" end="00:38:48.030" style="s2">them and to give them tools that will be</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.560" end="00:38:52.950" style="s2">empowering them especially in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.030" end="00:38:54.360" style="s2">their identities and and also to just</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.950" end="00:38:55.830" style="s2">not make them feel invisible because</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.360" end="00:38:57.270" style="s2">right now I think there are many</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.830" end="00:39:01.170" style="s2">populations in the fact that feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.270" end="00:39:03.090" style="s2">completely invisible who are very very</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.170" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">vulnerable but not in the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.090" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">people think and I could speak into that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.910" end="00:39:09.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m speaking to adolescents now</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:12.030" style="s2">because the media focuses on this one</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.210" end="00:39:13.380" style="s2">thing it&#39;s as if nothing else is I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.030" end="00:39:15.860" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.380" end="00:39:18.350" style="s2">happening in someone what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.860" end="00:39:21.420" style="s2">you know millions and millions of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.350" end="00:39:23.820" style="s2">adolescents cut off from their friends</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.420" end="00:39:25.350" style="s2">at a time when developmentally is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.820" end="00:39:25.800" style="s2">precisely when they should be out of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.350" end="00:39:27.960" style="s2">house</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.800" end="00:39:29.750" style="s2">hanging with their friends right not for</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.960" end="00:39:31.320" style="s2">having fun but for having the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.750" end="00:39:33.150" style="s2">differentiation from the parental</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.320" end="00:39:36.260" style="s2">holding container to have an autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.150" end="00:39:38.430" style="s2">identity and all that stuff right so</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.260" end="00:39:39.870" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s a little bit of it I</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.430" end="00:39:41.820" style="s2">would talk to the mayor about something</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.870" end="00:39:43.830" style="s2">like that like we&#39;ve got an act we</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.820" end="00:39:47.400" style="s2">already had an adolescent mental health</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.830" end="00:39:50.010" style="s2">crisis right and then this happened what</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.400" end="00:39:50.460" style="s2">can we do to actually somehow seize the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.010" end="00:39:54.990" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.460" end="00:39:59.850" style="s2">and yeah and I think it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.990" end="00:40:03.350" style="s2">critical for for the future that this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.850" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">affect the youth in a net positive way</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.350" end="00:40:08.670" style="s2">which is best to say that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">opportunity for maturation which creates</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.670" end="00:40:13.020" style="s2">a generation that&#39;s very powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">opposed to something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.020" end="00:40:21.000" style="s2">debilitating so that that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:25.650" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking in those in those areas can</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.000" end="00:40:28.050" style="s2">I follow up totally if you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.650" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">about boots on the ground so if the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.050" end="00:40:33.930" style="s2">one topic I mean it could be identity</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:37.010" style="s2">development I work with both high</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.930" end="00:40:39.900" style="s2">schoolers but I&#39;m also adjunct college</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.010" end="00:40:42.990" style="s2">so if we&#39;re talking boots on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.900" end="00:40:45.570" style="s2">I feel like there is this spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:51.540" style="s2">pigness right in our society and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.570" end="00:40:53.580" style="s2">it&#39;s this taboo space to to access with</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.540" end="00:40:58.050" style="s2">these younger generations because</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.580" end="00:41:01.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no grounding as a society right</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.050" end="00:41:03.720" style="s2">now is is there a topic that would that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.530" end="00:41:06.930" style="s2">could that you think would resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.720" end="00:41:09.770" style="s2">them to be a springboard for them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.930" end="00:41:12.150" style="s2">understand the power that they have and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.770" end="00:41:19.320" style="s2">you know where to go with that power</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.150" end="00:41:23.190" style="s2">from here forward I mean I I keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.320" end="00:41:25.860" style="s2">returning to that the kids need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.190" end="00:41:28.470" style="s2">history from their elders I keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.860" end="00:41:32.010" style="s2">returning to that because really the key</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.470" end="00:41:34.380" style="s2">to them actualizing their historical</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.010" end="00:41:36.890" style="s2">agency as a generation and as</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.380" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">individuals is by knowing where they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.890" end="00:41:45.960" style="s2">in his dream and and so especially the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:47.310" style="s2">stories from elders that are about time</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.960" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">that were fundamentally different than</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.310" end="00:41:51.210" style="s2">the times now right they&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:53.640" style="s2">a way normalize these times because we</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.210" end="00:41:57.060" style="s2">realize that whoa you know other</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.640" end="00:42:00.330" style="s2">generations have had abrupt world</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.060" end="00:42:05.600" style="s2">historical significant events occur and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.330" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">so yeah I think if we could get them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.600" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">engage in a form of intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:15.000" style="s2">kind of conversation and let them steer</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:17.340" style="s2">like let them ask the questions to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.000" end="00:42:19.320" style="s2">elders that they want to ask it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.340" end="00:42:22.580" style="s2">responsibility to get that container</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.320" end="00:42:25.620" style="s2">created and to make it appealing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.580" end="00:42:27.000" style="s2">valued by the society that this is as</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.620" end="00:42:30.270" style="s2">important or more important than your</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.000" end="00:42:33.270" style="s2">schoolwork right to have every day in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.270" end="00:42:34.830" style="s2">our long conversation with son of an</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.270" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">older person from the community you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.830" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">never met right and you run through your</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:38.770" style="s2">series of questions and you start to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:40.839" style="s2">this like</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.770" end="00:42:42.430" style="s2">panorama of all these different lives</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.839" end="00:42:48.540" style="s2">and all these different time periods</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.430" end="00:42:52.119" style="s2">right and so that I think is some of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.540" end="00:42:55.089" style="s2">and other forms of creativity you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.119" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">with digital cameras and recording</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.089" end="00:42:59.650" style="s2">equipment and a bunch of stuff there is</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">the possibility for capturing their</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.650" end="00:43:04.030" style="s2">first-person experiences basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:09.640" style="s2">artistically and creating something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.030" end="00:43:13.060" style="s2">a museum of adolescence and childhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.640" end="00:43:15.970" style="s2">artistic expressions of dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.060" end="00:43:21.099" style="s2">crisis basically so like a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.970" end="00:43:23.140" style="s2">art project among hundreds of groups of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.099" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">adolescents or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.140" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">and I&#39;m just completely spitballing I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:30.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought it through but my hope</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:31.990" style="s2">is that and I&#39;m sure there are people</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.250" end="00:43:35.859" style="s2">trying to think about this stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.990" end="00:43:38.410" style="s2">know and so it got to be to the people</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.859" end="00:43:41.050" style="s2">to me that work a success story I love</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.410" end="00:43:43.089" style="s2">that because backlog talks about shadow</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.050" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">boxes and time and space and</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.089" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">understanding how even in organic</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:49.300" style="s2">objects are meaningful so I love it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:54.010" style="s2">thank you very much for the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.300" end="00:44:03.210" style="s2">okay all right Amy you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.010" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">I will unmute you so I am also I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.210" end="00:44:12.849" style="s2">an educator and I you had mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:16.420" style="s2">the concept of the one-room schoolhouse</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.849" end="00:44:19.210" style="s2">in your essay a bit and I was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.420" end="00:44:21.190" style="s2">what what your kind of vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.210" end="00:44:24.450" style="s2">one-room schoolhouse of the future is</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.190" end="00:44:28.170" style="s2">and if this could analog or scale to</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.450" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">adults unlike a one-room schoolhouse</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.170" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">working situation</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.130" end="00:44:39.390" style="s2">interesting yeah I in my book education</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:42.090" style="s2">and a time between worlds I lay out in</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.390" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">some detail this vision of what I call</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.090" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">an educational hub Network and what it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:50.940" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s basically a base you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:53.580" style="s2">take an existing school system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.940" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all the school buildings so</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.580" end="00:44:57.140" style="s2">you change the architecture of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:59.730" style="s2">school buildings to make those buildings</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.140" end="00:45:02.850" style="s2">something more like a community center</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.730" end="00:45:06.060" style="s2">slash co-working space slash library</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.850" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">slash museum in that place you have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.060" end="00:45:10.650" style="s2">bunch of Technology and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:13.140" style="s2">teacher citizen scientists who basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.650" end="00:45:16.260" style="s2">facilitate the creation of pop-up</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.140" end="00:45:18.870" style="s2">classrooms that also implicate the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.260" end="00:45:20.130" style="s2">parents in the community so next to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.870" end="00:45:22.500" style="s2">education that Network there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.130" end="00:45:25.470" style="s2">bunch of social miracles including basic</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.500" end="00:45:27.540" style="s2">income guarantee which basically allows</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.470" end="00:45:29.100" style="s2">parents the freedom to re-engage in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.540" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">their own education specifically</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.100" end="00:45:33.510" style="s2">targeted towards being able to help</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.750" end="00:45:36.780" style="s2">their children in this education hub</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.510" end="00:45:38.520" style="s2">network so the backend technology is</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.780" end="00:45:42.650" style="s2">something like a time and skill sharing</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.520" end="00:45:45.390" style="s2">and content delivery system which houses</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.650" end="00:45:47.250" style="s2">you know all the skills and curricula</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.390" end="00:45:48.660" style="s2">within the community and that includes</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.250" end="00:45:50.430" style="s2">not just the official teachers but also</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.660" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">the parents and professionals in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.430" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">community who want to be part of that so</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.520" style="s2">this is if those of you who&#39;ve read Ivan</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:58.980" style="s2">Illich D schooling Society this is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.520" end="00:46:01.710" style="s2">a version of that so the one-room</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.980" end="00:46:04.340" style="s2">schoolhouse is actually everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.710" end="00:46:07.460" style="s2">around that hub there are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.340" end="00:46:11.060" style="s2">classrooms popping up where let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.460" end="00:46:14.670" style="s2">student who wants to study a particular</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.060" end="00:46:16.290" style="s2">historical time period finds several</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.670" end="00:46:18.090" style="s2">other students who want to store it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.290" end="00:46:19.860" style="s2">study that time period at different ages</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.090" end="00:46:21.570" style="s2">they find two adults who have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.860" end="00:46:23.610" style="s2">knowledge and a location in the city</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.570" end="00:46:25.740" style="s2">where that time period is relevant right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.610" end="00:46:29.310" style="s2">and then for three hours that location</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.740" end="00:46:31.170" style="s2">in the city becomes a classroom where</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.310" end="00:46:32.520" style="s2">kids of different ages are interacting</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.170" end="00:46:35.850" style="s2">around the historical event with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.520" end="00:46:37.980" style="s2">guidance of let&#39;s say someone paid by</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.850" end="00:46:39.510" style="s2">the state to be there and to parents who</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.980" end="00:46:41.770" style="s2">are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.510" end="00:46:44.980" style="s2">or an old person who was actually there</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.770" end="00:46:46.630" style="s2">at the time that it happened there so</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.980" end="00:46:50.410" style="s2">that that&#39;s the vision it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.630" end="00:46:52.900" style="s2">very decentralized way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.410" end="00:46:55.960" style="s2">having an educational network structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.900" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">a lot hinges upon the technological back</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.960" end="00:47:00.940" style="s2">end which is what coordinates to pop-up</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:04.890" style="s2">classrooms and actually houses all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:07.840" style="s2">student work and creates a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.890" end="00:47:10.570" style="s2">self-organizing assessment system so</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.840" end="00:47:12.340" style="s2">that we and it ends up being quite a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.570" end="00:47:14.950" style="s2">complicated technological problem as</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.340" end="00:47:17.380" style="s2">well as far as getting that many</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.950" end="00:47:18.790" style="s2">students into that much diverse activity</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.380" end="00:47:22.810" style="s2">and still a sharing educational equity</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.790" end="00:47:25.420" style="s2">and still assuring the basic acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.810" end="00:47:28.390" style="s2">of things like reading writing and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.420" end="00:47:31.150" style="s2">there&#39;s more typical that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.390" end="00:47:33.100" style="s2">of the basic vision and right now in</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.150" end="00:47:35.980" style="s2">some place that&#39;s but certainly not in</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.100" end="00:47:39.820" style="s2">all places you&#39;re having little visions</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.980" end="00:47:42.190" style="s2">of this where school has now all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.820" end="00:47:43.960" style="s2">sudden had to run like a spoken-- hub</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.190" end="00:47:46.620" style="s2">model it&#39;s had to run all these little</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.960" end="00:47:49.420" style="s2">classrooms in every living room in town</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.620" end="00:47:51.010" style="s2">right and we&#39;re trying to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.420" end="00:47:52.870" style="s2">there&#39;s some there&#39;s so much variability</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.010" end="00:47:56.550" style="s2">in how well that&#39;s that&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.870" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">right now but we&#39;re becoming aware that</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.550" end="00:48:06.790" style="s2">this is this is a modality of Education</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:10.630" style="s2">that the digital affords cool so we may</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.790" end="00:48:12.880" style="s2">have time for one or two questions Alex</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.630" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">s and went unmute you if you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:25.240" style="s2">your question thanks Peter okay great</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:28.210" style="s2">thanks Zack for coming out and joining</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.240" end="00:48:30.040" style="s2">us in the forum so I&#39;m finding your</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.210" end="00:48:32.650" style="s2">presentation really interesting at a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.040" end="00:48:34.030" style="s2">number of level but the thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.650" end="00:48:35.830" style="s2">wondering about it kind of actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.030" end="00:48:38.320" style="s2">piggy backs on a question I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.830" end="00:48:40.810" style="s2">Nikolas blasted it was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.320" end="00:48:44.170" style="s2">ones and it had to do with the mythical</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.810" end="00:48:48.040" style="s2">poetic side of things that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.170" end="00:48:50.560" style="s2">the word that he used and I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.040" end="00:48:51.910" style="s2">wondering so to me it seems like you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.560" end="00:48:52.660" style="s2">know when thinking about this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.910" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.660" end="00:48:58.270" style="s2">skilled events that are going on there</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">can be two approaches they&#39;re sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.270" end="00:49:03.220" style="s2">right hand and a left hand</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:04.660" style="s2">maybe so there is the the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.220" end="00:49:09.010" style="s2">rational scientific philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.660" end="00:49:11.619" style="s2">approach and I guess I see stoicism as</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.010" end="00:49:14.220" style="s2">an example by the Stoics were very</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.619" end="00:49:17.710" style="s2">logical you know they were all about</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.220" end="00:49:22.059" style="s2">reason but also reason as virtue right</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.710" end="00:49:25.059" style="s2">not just like narrow self-interest but</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.059" end="00:49:27.220" style="s2">still like they were all about logic and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.059" end="00:49:29.710" style="s2">and and reason in that sense and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.220" end="00:49:33.460" style="s2">you have the kind of more mythical side</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.710" end="00:49:35.500" style="s2">on the other hand that seems to be more</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.460" end="00:49:38.200" style="s2">about emotion</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.500" end="00:49:40.390" style="s2">if the Stoics are all about harmony here</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.200" end="00:49:43.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a synthesis on struggle right</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.390" end="00:49:44.680" style="s2">conflict and you talk about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:48.789" style="s2">end of things</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.680" end="00:49:51.250" style="s2">in your article and so I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.789" end="00:49:52.630" style="s2">like how you see you mention you talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.250" end="00:49:54.280" style="s2">about reason there as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.630" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">in your in your piece and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.280" end="00:49:58.359" style="s2">wondering how you see those two</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:00.940" style="s2">interacting is one more important than</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.359" end="00:50:09.609" style="s2">the other you know how do they come</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.940" end="00:50:11.740" style="s2">together interesting yeah I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.609" end="00:50:15.549" style="s2">you&#39;re setting up like the two I would</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.740" end="00:50:17.559" style="s2">actually say that there&#39;s three because</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.549" end="00:50:19.240" style="s2">you have the kind of rational scientific</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.559" end="00:50:22.270" style="s2">let&#39;s say at the mythopoetic and I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.240" end="00:50:25.690" style="s2">you have the artistic or subjective</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.270" end="00:50:30.460" style="s2">which is which is getting at a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.690" end="00:50:32.799" style="s2">thing and my sense is that and I try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.460" end="00:50:34.270" style="s2">get at this in the in the article which</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.799" end="00:50:38.289" style="s2">is that none of those alone are</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.270" end="00:50:42.430" style="s2">sufficient and each of those need one</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.289" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">another that the ration all ends up if</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.430" end="00:50:46.510" style="s2">you&#39;re follow it through like the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:50.650" style="s2">did the rational ends up pointing beyond</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.510" end="00:50:53.470" style="s2">itself right but the mythic ends up also</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.650" end="00:50:55.750" style="s2">being incomplete right because it asks</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.470" end="00:50:58.440" style="s2">questions of the world which we can act</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.750" end="00:51:00.119" style="s2">on and get answers about</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.440" end="00:51:03.420" style="s2">and then of course the artistic requires</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.119" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">those other two as input that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.420" end="00:51:07.619" style="s2">artistic can&#39;t stand alone it actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.480" style="s2">has to do with some take on the nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.619" end="00:51:11.730" style="s2">of the world and some take on what it</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.480" end="00:51:13.349" style="s2">means and then you&#39;re putting it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.730" end="00:51:17.030" style="s2">individually with an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.349" end="00:51:20.520" style="s2">presentation so I&#39;m seeing like a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.030" end="00:51:22.859" style="s2">complex kind of relationship between all</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.520" end="00:51:24.750" style="s2">three of those where I wouldn&#39;t say one</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.859" end="00:51:27.180" style="s2">is primary but that they&#39;re in some kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.750" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">of moving dance some kind of evolving</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.180" end="00:51:33.059" style="s2">dance and so what I&#39;m asking people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:35.430" style="s2">are oriented to the spiritual and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.059" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">mythological to do is in the sense start</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.430" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">becoming more rational and when I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:41.730" style="s2">the paper anyway and when I&#39;m what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:43.890" style="s2">asking the people who are orienting just</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.730" end="00:51:45.150" style="s2">as scientists to do is to say hey admit</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.890" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">the fact that the thoughts of the heart</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.150" end="00:51:51.480" style="s2">matter and the paper itself is more like</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:52.859" style="s2">something I&#39;m singing right because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.480" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2">not really arguing anything and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.859" end="00:51:58.859" style="s2">citing any facts I&#39;m just expressing</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">myself basically so the paper is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.859" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">making almost the aesthetic validity</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:04.500" style="s2">claim more than anything else but</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.089" style="s2">there&#39;s a harmony to the aesthetic right</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.500" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a truthfulness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.089" end="00:52:11.250" style="s2">expressed in those so I&#39;m so I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.690" style="s2">yeah I guess I&#39;m saying it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.250" end="00:52:14.490" style="s2">the one or the other it&#39;s actually this</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.690" end="00:52:16.829" style="s2">much more complex that&#39;s not even - I</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.490" end="00:52:19.230" style="s2">like to go because I&#39;m saying three this</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.829" end="00:52:22.200" style="s2">is me actually rooting into landries</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.230" end="00:52:25.410" style="s2">metaphysics for orientation for those of</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.200" end="00:52:27.630" style="s2">you who are into the footnotes so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.410" end="00:52:29.609" style="s2">kind of how I&#39;m seeing it and in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.630" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">paper like I said I&#39;m trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.609" end="00:52:37.980" style="s2">strike a balance that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">between all all three great well squeeze</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.980" end="00:52:41.039" style="s2">in one more question</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:43.230" style="s2">Nicholas would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.039" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">question if you can put yourself off</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.230" end="00:52:52.849" style="s2">mute so thank you sac for being here</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.849" end="00:53:01.289" style="s2">yeah so I just wanted to sort of ask</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:03.990" style="s2">DOMA is really like a space that is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.289" end="00:53:05.549" style="s2">foreign from my everyday life right like</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.990" end="00:53:09.420" style="s2">the conversations we&#39;re having here are</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.549" end="00:53:11.830" style="s2">just so like they make sense the people</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.420" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">that partake in these in the space</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.830" end="00:53:16.330" style="s2">but if you try and you know get to these</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:21.010" style="s2">difficult conversations that you were</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.330" end="00:53:22.420" style="s2">mentioning I was yeah so you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.010" end="00:53:27.070" style="s2">really elaborated on the role of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.420" end="00:53:30.250" style="s2">language but how how does this language</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.070" end="00:53:32.740" style="s2">have to evolve in order all right people</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.250" end="00:53:34.480" style="s2">to sort of understand and and to help</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.740" end="00:53:36.250" style="s2">them with the transition to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.480" end="00:53:38.080" style="s2">new world right there because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.250" end="00:53:39.790" style="s2">the in between these two worlds like you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.080" end="00:53:41.530" style="s2">said so I want to keep it short so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.790" end="00:53:44.920" style="s2">can maybe still quickly answer it I</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.530" end="00:53:47.590" style="s2">think you right totally that&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.920" end="00:53:49.240" style="s2">this is actually a great question this</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.590" end="00:53:51.430" style="s2">is the question that the therapist and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.240" end="00:53:54.210" style="s2">the educator and the parent needs to ask</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.430" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">right which is it&#39;s not like how do i</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.210" end="00:53:58.450" style="s2">beam you to the top of the mountain so</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:53:59.980" style="s2">you can see the view it&#39;s like if I beam</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.450" end="00:54:01.690" style="s2">you to the top like teleport you to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.980" end="00:54:04.150" style="s2">top of the mountain you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.690" end="00:54:05.500" style="s2">disoriented and confused maybe you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.150" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">excited and you&#39;ll see some stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.500" end="00:54:08.680" style="s2">then when you go back down you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:11.050" style="s2">remember how you got there or what</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.680" end="00:54:13.990" style="s2">happened so the what you need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.050" end="00:54:15.790" style="s2">figure out that path up the mountain and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.990" end="00:54:17.830" style="s2">it will take time</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.790" end="00:54:20.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s one of the kind of crisis</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.830" end="00:54:22.390" style="s2">moments as that in fact everyone&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.110" end="00:54:24.460" style="s2">asked right now to be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.390" end="00:54:26.890" style="s2">philosopher or saint like everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.460" end="00:54:29.830" style="s2">to like stay home behave right face</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.890" end="00:54:31.810" style="s2">death worried like and like and like</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.830" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">handle their shit like and still like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.810" end="00:54:35.860" style="s2">work and take care of the kids and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:38.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like whoa everyone is being beamed</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.860" end="00:54:41.290" style="s2">at the top of a stoic mountain to try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.230" end="00:54:44.440" style="s2">remain calm and find harmony in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.290" end="00:54:47.850" style="s2">midst of chaos so that means for those</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.440" end="00:54:50.380" style="s2">of us who by whatever means or fate</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.850" end="00:54:53.170" style="s2">ended up climbing quite a distance</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.380" end="00:54:55.720" style="s2">before this happened there is some</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.170" end="00:54:57.370" style="s2">obligation to try to find a way not to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.720" end="00:55:00.400" style="s2">like just drop it all on the table at</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.370" end="00:55:02.170" style="s2">once but mm you know like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.400" end="00:55:05.800" style="s2">worst pedagogical advice you need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.170" end="00:55:08.020" style="s2">find the ways in right both the moments</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.800" end="00:55:11.950" style="s2">in the conversation and those topics</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.020" end="00:55:13.570" style="s2">that are naturally philosophical right</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.950" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">now good teachers can kind of recognize</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.570" end="00:55:18.220" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s like a vein that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:20.140" style="s2">get in kind of open up because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.220" end="00:55:22.230" style="s2">already interested in it right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.140" end="00:55:27.069" style="s2">not afraid to go there</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.230" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">so like yeah so that&#39;s basically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.069" end="00:55:32.829" style="s2">a teacher late advice to say be a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:36.609" style="s2">careful enough conversation partner to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.829" end="00:55:38.109" style="s2">kind of to follow their lead like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.609" end="00:55:40.569" style="s2">what pedagogy means it means to lead</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.109" end="00:55:42.369" style="s2">along so but first you need to see kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.569" end="00:55:44.980" style="s2">of where they&#39;re going in the sense like</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.369" end="00:55:46.539" style="s2">it needs a need to detect it and be</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.980" end="00:55:49.270" style="s2">careful and then know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.539" end="00:55:50.770" style="s2">pushing too far right no when they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.270" end="00:55:55.900" style="s2">handle it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.770" end="00:55:58.150" style="s2">and yeah so I think but just to ask the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.900" end="00:56:00.730" style="s2">question is a student right because many</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.150" end="00:56:03.970" style="s2">people who operate philosophically or</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.730" end="00:56:06.039" style="s2">just tracking more they&#39;ll just dump it</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.970" end="00:56:07.420" style="s2">on people even when people can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.039" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">it don&#39;t want to handle it don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.420" end="00:56:10.920" style="s2">think about it right so I&#39;m careful like</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:14.380" style="s2">this with my own family it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.920" end="00:56:18.490" style="s2">little droplets of stuff that I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.380" end="00:56:20.289" style="s2">not the whole deluge which would send</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.490" end="00:56:23.559" style="s2">him into a panic attack something right</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.289" end="00:56:26.589" style="s2">so you just needs to be this care even</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.559" end="00:56:28.750" style="s2">in conversation and you&#39;re caring for</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.589" end="00:56:30.279" style="s2">their better self right so it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.750" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">what&#39;s ken wilber just called idiot</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.279" end="00:56:34.329" style="s2">compassion idiot compassion is when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:35.319" style="s2">let the alcoholic stay in alcoholic cuz</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.329" end="00:56:36.549" style="s2">you&#39;re just being nice because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.319" end="00:56:40.150" style="s2">want to make him feel bad that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.549" end="00:56:42.510" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing this is a subtle</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.150" end="00:56:46.059" style="s2">balance between challenge and support</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.510" end="00:56:48.490" style="s2">essentially with a clear and explicit</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.059" end="00:56:50.730" style="s2">sense of like I love you no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.490" end="00:56:53.230" style="s2">even if you never come to grips with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.730" end="00:56:55.569" style="s2">so there also has to be that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.230" end="00:56:57.190" style="s2">like people can learn and change and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.569" end="00:57:00.430" style="s2">transform people can even roll over</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.190" end="00:57:03.220" style="s2">their identity if they&#39;re held in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.430" end="00:57:05.170" style="s2">container so often what I do before</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.220" end="00:57:07.390" style="s2">these conversations is have other</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.170" end="00:57:11.500" style="s2">conversations that makes it clear that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.390" end="00:57:13.029" style="s2">we&#39;re friends it&#39;s safe you know like we</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.500" end="00:57:15.190" style="s2">can still be together</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.029" end="00:57:16.270" style="s2">I don&#39;t need you to understand me or</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.190" end="00:57:18.760" style="s2">follow me here</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.270" end="00:57:22.510" style="s2">for me to respect you and love you right</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.760" end="00:57:25.120" style="s2">so give that containment and support and</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.510" end="00:57:29.440" style="s2">then challenge</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.120" end="00:57:31.660" style="s2">and deepen and contextualise and all of</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.440" end="00:57:34.750" style="s2">those things that you want to do to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.660" end="00:57:37.300" style="s2">bring people out of a narrower view so</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.750" end="00:57:39.820" style="s2">but good it&#39;s the right question to ask</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.300" end="00:57:47.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s an amazing answer so thank</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.820" end="00:57:49.270" style="s2">you so much great so we&#39;ll close up in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.140" end="00:57:50.860" style="s2">the in a moment but I just like to hand</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.270" end="00:57:55.320" style="s2">it to Zack for any kind of closing</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.860" end="00:57:57.940" style="s2">thoughts this was wonderful for me I</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.320" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">like I said I hadn&#39;t talked to like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.940" end="00:58:03.580" style="s2">classroom of people in awhile and so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:05.500" style="s2">was really nice to see all your faces</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.580" end="00:58:09.690" style="s2">and to get the different questions from</p>
