<p begin="00:00:00.940" end="00:00:10.299" style="s2">So, I want to take another look at this figure<br />to begin with.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.299" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">Now, one of the reasons that I began to think<br />about these sorts of things is because I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:32.110" style="s2">to understand what it might mean to have a<br />set of, let’s say a set of values and beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.110" end="00:00:36.520" style="s2">(because those two things go together), that<br />would…</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.520" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">I guess part of the question was, is it possible<br />to develop of system of beliefs that’s outside</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:43.059" style="s2">of the realm of ideology?</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.059" end="00:00:52.129" style="s2">You know, because one thing you might claim<br />is that it’s all ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.129" end="00:00:55.800" style="s2">Any belief system is ideological.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.800" end="00:01:00.929" style="s2">And if you develop a belief system that criticises<br />other belief systems it just means that you’ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.929" end="00:01:06.430" style="s2">developed a new ideological stance.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.430" end="00:01:09.184" style="s2">And there’s some… that’s a good argument,<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.184" end="00:01:12.300" style="s2">I can think of a number of ways that it’s<br />true.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.300" end="00:01:19.400" style="s2">One of the things Nietzsche said in the late<br />1800s was that if you inhabited a belief system,</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.400" end="00:01:26.210" style="s2">even a religious system, and you lost faith<br />in it, not only did you lose faith in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.210" end="00:01:31.750" style="s2">system, but you also potentially lost faith<br />in systems themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.750" end="00:01:34.030" style="s2">And so, it was a meta-collapse, in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.030" end="00:01:37.930" style="s2">Not only did you lose your belief, but you<br />lost your belief in beliefs.</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.930" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">So you think of the set of all possible beliefs<br />and then abandoning any hope of relying on</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:51.620" style="s2">those as valid sources of information.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.620" end="00:01:56.110" style="s2">You know, so that’s one perspective and<br />it’s a powerful one, and Nietzsche believed</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.110" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">that that was a certain pathway to nihilism,<br />essentially, or perhaps to a reactionary totalitarianism,</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">but it boils down to the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">I’ve been reading this book recently, the<br />title of which I can’t remember, unfortunately.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:16.470" style="s2">But I’ll tell it to you after class.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.470" end="00:02:26.200" style="s2">It’s a critique of certain lines of left-wing<br />ideological thinking, including the existential</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.200" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">thought of people like Jean-Paul Sartre, and<br />Foucault.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:36.280" style="s2">And one of the most trenchant critiques of<br />Sartre, because he believes that you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.280" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">an absolute freedom, that you’re destined<br />for freedom, that you’re doomed to it, in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:43.870" style="s2">some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.870" end="00:02:50.291" style="s2">And that part of your existential journey<br />is to establish an authenticity that’s correct</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.291" end="00:02:51.291" style="s2">for you.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.291" end="00:02:58.770" style="s2">But he doesn’t, he isn’t able really to<br />give any description of what that should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.770" end="00:02:59.770" style="s2">grounded in.</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.770" end="00:03:10.120" style="s2">And the critic concludes that all Sartre can<br />do is stand outside of any potential belief</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.120" end="00:03:12.380" style="s2">system and criticise it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.380" end="00:03:17.099" style="s2">And that that’s… there’s nothing in<br />it for anyone as a consequence of that.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.099" end="00:03:18.990" style="s2">It’s only destructive.</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.990" end="00:03:26.030" style="s2">Now, it’s important to remember, with regards<br />to Sartre, that he viewed other people, to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.030" end="00:03:33.430" style="s2">some degree, like the common man, the bourgeoisie,<br />we might say, as the embodiment of non-freedom,</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.430" end="00:03:38.819" style="s2">of inauthenticity, and also as a barrier to<br />genuine authenticity.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.819" end="00:03:44.600" style="s2">So he wasn’t willing to give any credence<br />to the utility of normality.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.600" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">But I also think he wasn’t able to tolerate<br />the consequences of his own thought, because</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:54.800" style="s2">he was an avid supporter of the communist<br />party, far after anyone with any reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.800" end="00:03:56.860" style="s2">moral sense would have stopped doing that.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.860" end="00:04:02.069" style="s2">So Sartre didn’t really denounce the communists<br />until the end of the… beginning of the 70s,</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.069" end="00:04:03.069" style="s2">roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.069" end="00:04:06.350" style="s2">He was never a card-carrying communist, but<br />he was very left-leaning.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.350" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">And you know by the 1970s, by the late 60s,<br />by the early 70s, a lot of the evidence about</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:19.340" style="s2">what was going on in Soviet Russia had been<br />in for 30 years.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:25.260" style="s2">So there was really no excuse for not facing<br />up to that, and trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.260" end="00:04:26.260" style="s2">it meant.</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.260" end="00:04:29.160" style="s2">And you know, it would be bad enough if it<br />was just the Soviet Union, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.160" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">The same sort of thing happened wherever those<br />utopian presuppositions were put into place.</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:43.300" style="s2">And I suppose many of you don’t know this,<br />but Pol Pot, who was the Cambodian dictator,</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.300" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">was educated at the Sorbonne, and he wrote<br />his thesis (I think it was his PhD thesis,</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:05:00.100" style="s2">although it might have been his Master’s<br />thesis) on the Marxist doctrine that urban</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.100" end="00:05:04.060" style="s2">people were parasites on rural people.</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.060" end="00:05:10.020" style="s2">So you know, there’s a theory that says<br />that the general value is generated purely</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.020" end="00:05:15.370" style="s2">by labour, and much of that is rural labour,<br />and the cities siphon off the excess productive</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.370" end="00:05:21.330" style="s2">power and are able to parasitize the countryside<br />as a consequence of that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.330" end="00:05:28.860" style="s2">Which is a, you know, tremendously non-productive<br />theory.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.860" end="00:05:33.160" style="s2">But Pol Pot put it in practice, and so when<br />he went back to Cambodia he chased everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.160" end="00:05:36.370" style="s2">out of the cities and killed about six million<br />people.</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.370" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">So, you know, you can read about that if you<br />want.</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:42.940" style="s2">It’s a pretty appalling section of 20th<br />century history.</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.940" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">Especially when it was the case that he was<br />educated in the West and had these presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">drummed into him.</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:56.120" style="s2">Well then there’s Foucault.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.120" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">Foucault, who I have no respect for, by the<br />way…</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">I’ve read a fair bit of Foucault, and I<br />think everything he says is obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:11.669" style="s2">So for example, he criticises the idea of<br />mental illness as a social construct.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.669" end="00:06:14.389" style="s2">It’s like, well yeah, obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.389" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">I mean, it’s not like psychiatrists and<br />psychologists and mental health professionals,</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:24.540" style="s2">who are relatively well-informed, haven’t<br />known about that since… for the last 60</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.540" end="00:06:25.540" style="s2">years.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.540" end="00:06:33.070" style="s2">I mean, it might be a revelation to people<br />who don’t notice that psychiatry, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.070" end="00:06:39.220" style="s2">is something like a compromise between the<br />patient biology and the social world.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.220" end="00:06:46.030" style="s2">You know, I mean, psychiatric ailments often<br />have a biological tilt, but the way they manifest</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.030" end="00:06:54.650" style="s2">themselves in society is clearly conditioned<br />in very intense ways by the particular conditions</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.650" end="00:06:59.740" style="s2">obtaining at the point that the person who<br />has that biological predisposition exists,</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.740" end="00:07:05.960" style="s2">even when it’s not pathological, can be<br />tilted one way or another by cultural norms.</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.960" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">And then of course, when you’re dealing<br />with issues like insurance payment, and treatment,</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:15.910" style="s2">and hospitalisation, obviously you’re pulling<br />in all sorts of systems that are by no means</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.910" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">purely scientific.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:21.160" style="s2">But I don’t find it a particularly useful<br />critique.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.160" end="00:07:24.870" style="s2">It’s obvious, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.870" end="00:07:26.750" style="s2">And, the other thing that Foucault did.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.750" end="00:07:33.030" style="s2">I mean, I think this is the typical, especially<br />the French intellectuals’, typical sleight</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.030" end="00:07:38.330" style="s2">of hand once Marxism became… you know, once<br />you were no longer able to call yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.330" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">committed Marxist, because committed Marxism<br />had led to unbelievable brutality, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">on a scale that had never been experienced<br />in the entire history of the planet, at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">in terms of its reach and duration.</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:07:59.220" style="s2">You didn’t get to call yourself a committed<br />Marxist anymore, unless there were people</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.220" end="00:08:04.350" style="s2">(and you still see them) saying “well that<br />wasn’t real Marxism), which I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.350" end="00:08:06.430" style="s2">cop-out of staggering proportions.</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.430" end="00:08:11.350" style="s2">It usually means “well if I was the person<br />running the country that wouldn’t have happened”.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.350" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">That’s the logic behind it… “they didn’t<br />put the principles into practice properly”.</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:19.530" style="s2">It’s like yeah well lots of people put the<br />damn principles into practice and the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.530" end="00:08:20.979" style="s2">thing happened everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.979" end="00:08:26.250" style="s2">So at some point you have to kind of wonder<br />if there’s something wrong with the principles.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.250" end="00:08:33.560" style="s2">Anyways, what Foucault did was take the Marxist<br />presupposition that everything could be boiled</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.560" end="00:08:38.909" style="s2">down to economics and economic power and translate<br />it into the idea that everything just translated</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.909" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">into power, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">And that the reason that we have institiutions<br />is to include and to exclude and that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:50.050" style="s2">institutions always run for the benefit of<br />those at the top.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.050" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">It’s like well yeah, that’s a little bit<br />true, but it’s… a scientist would look</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:02.510" style="s2">at that and say well probably… you know,<br />power dynamics in a functioning economic and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.510" end="00:09:09.990" style="s2">political system maybe account for 10% of<br />the variance, something like that, maybe 15%.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.990" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">It’s like, say you want to go to an Ivy<br />League school.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:17.630" style="s2">Well if you’re parents went to the school<br />you’re more likely to get in, but you’re</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.630" end="00:09:22.100" style="s2">not that much more likely to get in and you<br />still have to be… you know roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.100" end="00:09:28.670" style="s2">what happens is if you have a pretty decent<br />high school GPA and you do very well on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.670" end="00:09:34.040" style="s2">SATs, and you have some other talents of some<br />sort, because that’s also necessary, then</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.040" end="00:09:38.770" style="s2">they might pick you over someone else who’s<br />roughly equally qualified if you have a familial</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.770" end="00:09:40.780" style="s2">history attendance at the school.</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.780" end="00:09:49.430" style="s2">So obviously you get an advantage, but it’s<br />not the kind of advantage that accounts for</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.430" end="00:09:52.450" style="s2">the entirety of how the system is structured.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.450" end="00:09:53.570" style="s2">It’s an advantage.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.570" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">Well, you can say that’s not fair.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:58.220" style="s2">It’s like, yeah okay, fair enough.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.220" end="00:10:06.970" style="s2">Most systems are certainly not 100% either<br />fair or just, definitely not.</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.970" end="00:10:13.870" style="s2">But, you know, instead of comparing them to<br />utopia you might compare them to another system,</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.870" end="00:10:15.550" style="s2">which is the only reasonable way to do it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.550" end="00:10:19.670" style="s2">It’s like, everything looks terrible when<br />you compare it to the best thing you can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.670" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:27.180" style="s2">But the best thing you can possibly imagine<br />is an empty fiction, because it’s so devoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.180" end="00:10:30.779" style="s2">of detailed content that you can’t use it<br />as a guide to reality.</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.779" end="00:10:38.140" style="s2">Now, I mean, the idea that things could be<br />better has its roots in, in some sense, a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.140" end="00:10:41.860" style="s2">broad-scale utopian project, and I believe<br />things could be better.</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.860" end="00:10:45.950" style="s2">But that doesn’t mean that when you’re<br />doing an analysis of a complex system you</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.950" end="00:10:50.839" style="s2">get to compare it to an ideological utopia<br />and then describe all the reasons that it’s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.839" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">bad.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.470" style="s2">It’s not appropriate to do that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.470" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">It’s too simplistic, you’re not going<br />to do anything to actually address the problems</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">that the system has if you take that approach.</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:09.990" style="s2">And then, of course, pure utopian thinking<br />is extraordinarily dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.990" end="00:11:17.850" style="s2">Because if you think that you’re way of<br />molding society into some ultimate state of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.850" end="00:11:23.430" style="s2">perfection is headed towards some ultimate<br />state of perfection, then you can justify</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.430" end="00:11:28.180" style="s2">absolutely anything you do right now, on the<br />basis of the fact that things are going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.180" end="00:11:30.440" style="s2">improve so radically in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.440" end="00:11:33.030" style="s2">And that means any of your behaviours are<br />excused.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.030" end="00:11:35.550" style="s2">The end is worth it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.550" end="00:11:46.459" style="s2">Well, if someone says that, you have to kind<br />of wonder what they’re actually planning</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.459" end="00:11:48.310" style="s2">to do.</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.310" end="00:11:52.589" style="s2">Okay, so, well what’s the issue?</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.589" end="00:11:59.380" style="s2">The issue is that it’s… so the same critic,<br />with regards to Foucault, said that well it’s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.380" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">basically the same thing, that Foucault criticised<br />a variety of profound institutions.</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:14.260" style="s2">Sexual institutions say, like marriage, and<br />then institutions of power, like prisons,</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.260" end="00:12:19.310" style="s2">and institutions of mental health, like the<br />whole institutional framework.</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.310" end="00:12:22.920" style="s2">He criticised them on the basis of power and<br />exclusion.</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.920" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">And you could do that and there’s some truth<br />in it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:32.060" style="s2">But you know Foucault also made the presupposition,<br />and the problem with that presupposition,</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.060" end="00:12:37.130" style="s2">that everything is about something else, is<br />that it’s almost impossible to see how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.130" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">can’t be applied to Foucault himself.</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:46.850" style="s2">So you’d have to ask, if you were a student<br />of Foucault, what power aims drove his attempt</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.850" end="00:12:49.970" style="s2">to analyse everything in terms of power?</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.970" end="00:12:53.820" style="s2">And I actually think with Foucault it’s<br />pretty obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.820" end="00:12:55.810" style="s2">But it’s a game that never goes anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.810" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">Okay, so I thought about that a lot, it’s<br />like, is there any system that you can develop</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:07.170" style="s2">that doesn’t have the negative consequences<br />of systems in general?</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.170" end="00:13:11.840" style="s2">And then if that is possible, how and why<br />might it be possible?</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.840" end="00:13:18.180" style="s2">And this is partly why I’m talking to you<br />about this particular diagram again.</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.180" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">I think the reason, now I don’t know this,<br />and you guys can think it through yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:26.790" style="s2">I mean, lots of people have talked to me about<br />the content of this course and you know, they’ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.790" end="00:13:32.830" style="s2">said that it’s been very helpful for them<br />when it comes to interpreting certain elements</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.830" end="00:13:35.150" style="s2">of their life.</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.150" end="00:13:38.529" style="s2">But some people have said well it’s just<br />another system.</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.529" end="00:13:41.700" style="s2">And I don’t believe that.</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.700" end="00:13:43.420" style="s2">I think it’s a meta-system.</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.420" end="00:13:46.670" style="s2">And I don’t think the rules that apply to<br />systems also apply to meta-systems.</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.670" end="00:13:51.280" style="s2">But you know, that could just be me.</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.280" end="00:13:53.980" style="s2">So you’re going to have to decide that for<br />yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.980" end="00:13:59.959" style="s2">But I think the reason that I can make that<br />claim, and that it’s a valid claim is because</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.959" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">first of all, I don’t believe that it’s<br />an intellectual system.</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">I don’t think it’s an attempt to reduce<br />a complex set of phenomena to something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:18.100" style="s2">is… dispenses with important elements of<br />their existence.</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.100" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">So for example, let me give you an example<br />of how that sort of thing happens.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.850" style="s2">If you’re looking at the world through a<br />biased lens, what it means is that you take</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.850" end="00:14:29.610" style="s2">non-random samples of the environmental data.</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.610" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">So I can give you a quick example of something<br />I saw that I thought was very particular in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:37.720" style="s2">that regard.</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.720" end="00:14:42.829" style="s2">I don’t think I’ve used this example before,<br />but about ten years ago or thereabouts Naomi</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.829" end="00:14:47.180" style="s2">Klein made this documentary about this factory<br />down in South America.</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.180" end="00:14:49.200" style="s2">I believe it was in Argentina.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.200" end="00:14:55.490" style="s2">And this was just after all the foreign capital<br />fled out of Argentina and the economy collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.490" end="00:14:59.880" style="s2">completely, which is something that happens<br />to Argentina fairly regularly, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.880" end="00:15:04.570" style="s2">And she went down there to this factory where<br />there were working men and they had been building</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.570" end="00:15:05.570" style="s2">heavy machinery.</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.570" end="00:15:09.510" style="s2">And the working men had decided that they<br />were going to… the factory had been padlocked</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.510" end="00:15:13.070" style="s2">and they had been locked out because things<br />had come to a halt.</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.070" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">And they had decided that they were going<br />to take a chainsaw to the factory gate and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:19.000" style="s2">go in there and start making heavy machinery<br />again.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.000" end="00:15:23.029" style="s2">And you know, it was a very cool documentary<br />as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.029" end="00:15:26.310" style="s2">She went down there and she interviewed all<br />these working guys and they talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.310" end="00:15:29.550" style="s2">their lives had been brought to a halt by<br />the factory closure.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.550" end="00:15:34.110" style="s2">And obviously it sucked that they were sitting<br />around doing nothing and not being paid for</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.110" end="00:15:37.991" style="s2">doing anything when they could’ve been inside<br />the factory building heavy machinery, which</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.991" end="00:15:39.860" style="s2">is what they wanted to do.</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.860" end="00:15:44.740" style="s2">So she went down there and laid out their<br />story and it was very sympathetic to the workers</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.740" end="00:15:47.820" style="s2">and good, you know, fair enough, good.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.820" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">But then she went and interviewed the guy<br />who owned the factory and she didn’t ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:53.980" style="s2">him any real questions.</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.980" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">What she did instead was caricaturize him,<br />even a priori, you know, as sort of a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:11.760" style="s2">capitalist, sort of like the millionaire in<br />Monopoly, and never tried to get beneath the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.760" end="00:16:17.459" style="s2">superficial a priori categorisation to find<br />out what he actually thought.</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.459" end="00:16:21.250" style="s2">And I was just waiting, I thought, well this<br />is cool, what the hell does the factory owner</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.250" end="00:16:22.250" style="s2">have to say?</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:26.060" style="s2">It’s like, where did his money go, why does<br />he think he has a right to the factory, like</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.060" end="00:16:27.390" style="s2">what are his conditions of ownership?</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.390" end="00:16:28.610" style="s2">Did he earn the money?</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.610" end="00:16:30.210" style="s2">Did he inherit it?</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.210" end="00:16:35.230" style="s2">It’s like, what does he think about the<br />fact that Argentina’s economy has collapsed?</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:37.980" style="s2">How does he feel about the fact that all these<br />workers are out of work?</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.980" end="00:16:40.690" style="s2">What does he think about the fact that they<br />opened up the factory again?</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.690" end="00:16:44.019" style="s2">Like, there’s a lot of interesting things<br />to ask this guy.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.019" end="00:16:46.630" style="s2">None of it, none of it happened.</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.630" end="00:16:51.180" style="s2">And so, to me what happened was that she was<br />someone with neglect.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.180" end="00:16:55.230" style="s2">You know, she was looking at the world but<br />she could only see half of everything.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.230" end="00:17:04.539" style="s2">And the half she saw was probably perfectly<br />justifiable, had its proper domain of application,</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.539" end="00:17:09.789" style="s2">but the half she missed, well, what about<br />that part of the story?</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.789" end="00:17:15.689" style="s2">You’re going to reduce that to cliché and<br />stereotype and expand up the rest of the story?</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.689" end="00:17:19.169" style="s2">Well, the only reason you’d do that is if<br />you didn’t want to find out what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.169" end="00:17:20.169" style="s2">was going on.</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.169" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">If all you wanted to do was gather evidence<br />that would support your initial theory.</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:31.580" style="s2">Now, I know perfectly well that there’s<br />plenty of situations where workers, the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.580" end="00:17:33.419" style="s2">of workers are absolutely abysmal.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.419" end="00:17:38.539" style="s2">I mean, one of the books I’ve read that<br />I think a remarkable documentation of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.539" end="00:17:43.250" style="s2">is a book by George Orwell called ‘Road<br />to Wigan Pier’, which is a study of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.250" end="00:17:47.489" style="s2">conditions that coal miners lived in in the<br />1930s in Britain.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.489" end="00:17:49.429" style="s2">And you know, it’s bloody dismal.</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.429" end="00:17:57.769" style="s2">And the idea that they were exploited, well,<br />that’s a tougher one, because the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.769" end="00:18:03.820" style="s2">Revolution was very, very hard on people,<br />and it was really, really hard on some people.</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.820" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">You know, particularly on some people.</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">Whether that was because of exploitation or<br />because of the existence of absolute poverty</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:14.139" style="s2">is not all that obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.139" end="00:18:18.149" style="s2">And you know… so it’s a complicated issue.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.149" end="00:18:24.269" style="s2">Now there’s lots of times when workers were<br />clearly exploited, but I think there are times</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.269" end="00:18:25.649" style="s2">as well when they weren’t.</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.649" end="00:18:31.379" style="s2">Anyways, it’s a great book, and he does<br />a lovely job of laying out a rationale for</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.379" end="00:18:36.770" style="s2">why the workers should be treated far better<br />than they were treated, and you know, so fine,</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.770" end="00:18:38.630" style="s2">good, wonderful.</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.630" end="00:18:41.220" style="s2">There’s something to be said.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.220" end="00:18:46.359" style="s2">But the thing is when you want to say something,<br />you want to take an unbiased sample if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.359" end="00:18:51.429" style="s2">can, and so this is why I like this particular<br />mode of conceptualisation, and I think it’s…</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.429" end="00:18:56.570" style="s2">the reason I think it’s not an intellectual<br />construction is because I think it emerges</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.570" end="00:19:00.919" style="s2">naturally out of the structure of mythology<br />and narrative, and you can think this through</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.919" end="00:19:07.769" style="s2">yourself, but as far I’ve been able to tell,<br />narratives present themselves in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.769" end="00:19:09.850" style="s2">archetypal characters.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.850" end="00:19:14.789" style="s2">And the thing about a comprehensive narrative<br />is it can’t leave out an archetypal character,</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.789" end="00:19:15.940" style="s2">or it fails.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.940" end="00:19:19.080" style="s2">Now I can give you an example of this.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.080" end="00:19:24.009" style="s2">So how many of you have seen Disney’s ‘Sleeping<br />Beauty’?</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.009" end="00:19:25.720" style="s2">Okay, so many of you have.</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.720" end="00:19:26.769" style="s2">How many haven’t?</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.769" end="00:19:29.220" style="s2">Okay, so there’s a few that haven’t.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.220" end="00:19:32.580" style="s2">Well the Disney movies, you know they’re<br />kind of standard childhood fare.</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.580" end="00:19:37.640" style="s2">You know, in Sleeping Beauty, what happens<br />is the King and Queen give birth to a princess</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.640" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">after trying for a substantial amount of time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:44.639" style="s2">And she arrives healthy and beautiful, and<br />then they have a christening day and they</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.639" end="00:19:45.950" style="s2">invite everybody to it.</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:51.799" style="s2">But they don’t invite Maleficent, who’s<br />a dark witch, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.799" end="00:19:56.059" style="s2">You know, she’s Queen of the Underworld,<br />for lack of a better word.</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.059" end="00:19:59.239" style="s2">She’s the negative element of femininity.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.239" end="00:20:01.649" style="s2">And they don’t invite her to the party.</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.649" end="00:20:07.729" style="s2">And so she shows up anyways, and says that<br />because they didn’t invite her, their daughter’s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.729" end="00:20:14.190" style="s2">going to die when she hits sixteen, which<br />is roughly the age of let’s say sexual maturation</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.190" end="00:20:15.789" style="s2">for a story of that sort.</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.789" end="00:20:25.769" style="s2">Now there’s another little positive magic<br />female in the story, who mitigates that death</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.769" end="00:20:29.859" style="s2">sentence to protracted sleep.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.859" end="00:20:34.650" style="s2">Well the idea behind it, it’s a very, very<br />interesting story, it’s an Oedipal story</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:40.769" style="s2">in a sense, because what it says is that if<br />you’re parents protect you too much from</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.769" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">the dark side of life when you’re young,<br />what will happen when you start on the road</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:52.859" style="s2">to maturity is you’ll be so naïve and so<br />fragile that you’ll want to be unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.859" end="00:20:54.970" style="s2">instead of paying attention.</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.970" end="00:20:58.710" style="s2">And that you’re going to have to be rescued<br />from that state by something.</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.710" end="00:21:04.879" style="s2">And it could be a prince, which is how the<br />story lays itself out, or it also could be</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.879" end="00:21:09.179" style="s2">the symbolically masculine and exploratory<br />element of your own psyche.</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.179" end="00:21:14.090" style="s2">And the story’s ambivalent about whether<br />it’s an external event or an internal event,</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.090" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:17.940" style="s2">The things end up being the same.</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.940" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">And so that’s actually what happens in this<br />Sleeping Beauty story.</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:27.929" style="s2">You know, at the end, a prince, who’s also<br />enslaved by this terrible negative feminine</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.929" end="00:21:35.529" style="s2">force, manages to escape, and Maleficent turns<br />into a dragon and then he has to fight her,</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.529" end="00:21:36.979" style="s2">and then he goes and rescues the princess.</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.979" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">And she wakes up and the kingdoms rejuvenate<br />and everybody’s happy.</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.929" end="00:21:41.629" style="s2">It’s a classic, classic story.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.629" end="00:21:49.220" style="s2">And it’s not… it’s funny because the<br />Disney movie Frozen was put forward as a,</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.220" end="00:21:53.409" style="s2">in some sense as a feminist alternative to<br />the classic fairy tales, but first of all</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.409" end="00:21:56.500" style="s2">you can’t do that, you can’t just generate<br />up a fairy tale.</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.500" end="00:22:00.820" style="s2">You know, there’s recent evidence that some<br />of these fairy tales, the ones that the Grimm</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.820" end="00:22:06.519" style="s2">brothers and Hans Christian Andersen collected,<br />are up to ten thousand years old.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.519" end="00:22:08.970" style="s2">You can’t just come up with a counter-fairy<br />tale.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.970" end="00:22:11.989" style="s2">That’s just not how it works.</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.989" end="00:22:18.830" style="s2">And the way that a fairy tale is structured,<br />it has nothing to do with the necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.830" end="00:22:21.529" style="s2">anyone to rely on anyone else for anything.</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.529" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">It’s a complex portrayal of the dynamic<br />relationship between archetypal characters,</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:30.580" style="s2">and you know, it’s one form of the story.</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.580" end="00:22:33.770" style="s2">There’s lots of different forms of the story.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.770" end="00:22:37.179" style="s2">But what I like about Sleeping Beauty for<br />example, and this is what’s nice about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.179" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">real fairy tales, is that along with the positive<br />there’s negative, and it’s real negative.</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:44.009" style="s2">Like real fairy tales are terrifying.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.009" end="00:22:46.389" style="s2">I don’t… who is it?</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.389" end="00:22:48.779" style="s2">Is it in Sleeping Beauty?</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.779" end="00:22:49.779" style="s2">Or Snow White?</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.779" end="00:22:50.779" style="s2">I don’t remember.</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.779" end="00:22:55.149" style="s2">In one of the famous Grimm fairy tales, one<br />of the evil sisters ends up dancing in red</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.149" end="00:22:57.360" style="s2">hot shoes till she dies.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.360" end="00:23:02.710" style="s2">You know, it’s… they’re very, very violent<br />and unsettling.</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.710" end="00:23:05.629" style="s2">And it’s because they have the quality of<br />genuine folk tales.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.629" end="00:23:08.039" style="s2">But the reason for that is because they’re<br />dealing with real things.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.039" end="00:23:11.779" style="s2">Like the Hansel and Gretel’s story is a<br />good example of that, right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.779" end="00:23:13.609" style="s2">Kids are abandoned out in the woods.</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.609" end="00:23:16.519" style="s2">They find something that’s too good to be<br />true.</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.519" end="00:23:19.549" style="s2">Inside this thing that’s too good to be<br />true is something that wants to fatten them</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.549" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">up and devour them.</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.059" style="s2">It’s a rough story.</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.059" end="00:23:29.049" style="s2">But what it’s doing… the stories have<br />evolved to represent the fundamental dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.049" end="00:23:36.249" style="s2">elements of existence, if you conceptualise<br />existence in terms of character.</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.249" end="00:23:41.149" style="s2">And the thing is you have to conceptualise<br />existence in terms of character if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.149" end="00:23:45.499" style="s2">a person, because what you do in existence<br />is act out your character.</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.499" end="00:23:48.940" style="s2">So your character is an element of existence.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.940" end="00:23:52.889" style="s2">Now, you might say well that doesn’t mean<br />that society has a character.</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.889" end="00:23:55.299" style="s2">But actually, it does mean that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.299" end="00:24:00.330" style="s2">Because partly what happens… like if you’re<br />socialised, say, into a culture.</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.330" end="00:24:05.090" style="s2">The culture exists in the same relationship<br />to you, roughly speaking, as another person</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.090" end="00:24:06.190" style="s2">does.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.190" end="00:24:11.259" style="s2">So for example, if you put money in the bank,<br />which is in principle a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.259" end="00:24:16.059" style="s2">your labour, what you’re doing is entering<br />into a contract with the broader social world,</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.059" end="00:24:24.469" style="s2">which is one of promise, essentially, where<br />the future society promises to return your</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.469" end="00:24:26.309" style="s2">value at a future date.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.309" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">So it’s a contractual relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.200" end="00:24:34.039" style="s2">And the reason that God the Father is a very<br />common representation is because treating</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.039" end="00:24:41.269" style="s2">the ‘they’, in Heidegerrian terms, the<br />others, in Heideggerian terms, as if they’re</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.269" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">an embodied entity, actually works.</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">So it’s because it is an emergent property<br />of all of the personalities that make it up.</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.529" style="s2">And so you’re interacting with that emergent<br />personality all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.529" end="00:25:00.409" style="s2">You could even say for example, that that’s<br />the Freudian Id.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.409" end="00:25:05.529" style="s2">It’s the thing that… the representation<br />of that inside you is what makes you feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.529" end="00:25:09.350" style="s2">guilty when you transgress against certain<br />moral rules.</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.350" end="00:25:14.149" style="s2">And you might say, along with the radical<br />existentialists, that that’s just arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.149" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">and that you can create your own values, but<br />it’s not just arbitrary.</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">Because it’s dependent on the consent of<br />others, as well as on some internal harmony</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:24.330" style="s2">or disharmony.</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.330" end="00:25:25.820" style="s2">It’s not arbitrary.</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.820" end="00:25:30.529" style="s2">And you can’t just set that up by yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.529" end="00:25:36.529" style="s2">So these things are realities and they’re<br />deep realities.</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.529" end="00:25:41.320" style="s2">Now, this particular portrayal indicates a<br />kind of balance.</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:47.460" style="s2">So the fundamental ground of reality is neither<br />positive nor negative, it’s the ground out</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.460" end="00:25:50.440" style="s2">of which everything positive or negative emerges.</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.440" end="00:25:56.289" style="s2">So you might think of the fundamental ground<br />of reality as that which exists prior to your</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.289" end="00:25:57.509" style="s2">encounter with it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.509" end="00:25:59.639" style="s2">And we have no idea what that is.</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.639" end="00:26:08.379" style="s2">Now you can think about it as… people tend<br />to think about what things are made of in</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.379" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">atomic terms but it’s not a particularly<br />comprehensive way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:22.669" style="s2">Because what exists beyond the realm of your<br />comprehension is the patterned relationship</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.669" end="00:26:25.529" style="s2">between everything and everything.</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.529" end="00:26:30.710" style="s2">And you can’t reduce it to any simple level<br />of analysis because you miss all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.710" end="00:26:33.960" style="s2">elements of it that are extraordinarily important<br />if you do that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.960" end="00:26:39.139" style="s2">So you can’t do that, that’s not what<br />experience is made out of, or what the grounded</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.139" end="00:26:40.889" style="s2">experience is made out of.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.889" end="00:26:43.900" style="s2">And so it’s neutral in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.900" end="00:26:46.769" style="s2">Because it exists beyond your encounter with<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.769" end="00:26:49.010" style="s2">It’s the unknown as such.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.010" end="00:26:54.519" style="s2">And the reason that that’s often represented<br />in the form of a predatory lizard that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.519" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">something to offer is precisely because of<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:03.140" style="s2">The absolute unknown has the capacity to tear<br />you into pieces and burn you up, but it also</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.140" end="00:27:08.479" style="s2">has the possibility of rewarding you with<br />everything you could possibly be rewarded</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.479" end="00:27:09.479" style="s2">with.</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.479" end="00:27:12.450" style="s2">So it’s this strange juxtaposition of potential.</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.450" end="00:27:16.639" style="s2">I like to think about it as potential, you<br />know, because people can get a grip on what</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.639" end="00:27:18.249" style="s2">potential means.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.249" end="00:27:21.899" style="s2">There’s potential everywhere, whatever that<br />is.</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.899" end="00:27:25.019" style="s2">You have potential, your parents tell you<br />that all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.019" end="00:27:26.019" style="s2">What is that?</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.019" end="00:27:29.659" style="s2">Well, it’s the unrealised stuff of your<br />being.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.659" end="00:27:36.179" style="s2">Now it’s a very strange concept, potential,<br />because you can’t characterise it any way</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.179" end="00:27:38.539" style="s2">that you would characterise something that’s<br />real.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.539" end="00:27:41.219" style="s2">Because it’s not real, it’s potential.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.219" end="00:27:42.759" style="s2">But you act like it’s real.</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.759" end="00:27:46.039" style="s2">You know, you’ll feel guilty that you’re<br />not living up to your potential, you’re</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.039" end="00:27:47.519" style="s2">not manifesting your potential.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.519" end="00:27:53.009" style="s2">You want people to interact with you so that<br />they allow you to demonstrate your potential.</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.009" end="00:27:56.690" style="s2">You act as if it’s a reality continually.</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.690" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">You think as if it’s a reality continually.</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:03.519" style="s2">You ask if your relationship has potential,<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.519" end="00:28:08.869" style="s2">But it’s a very, very strange substance,<br />whatever this potential is.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.869" end="00:28:14.769" style="s2">It’s unrealised possibility, essentially,<br />but you regard it as something that’s fluid</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.769" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">and something that can develop in all sorts<br />of different directions, and something whose</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:23.259" style="s2">development you can shape.</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.259" end="00:28:25.349" style="s2">Because otherwise why would you feel guilty,<br />you know?</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.349" end="00:28:30.950" style="s2">It’s like, if you’re doing the wrong thing,<br />you’re realising some potential in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.950" end="00:28:33.599" style="s2">way, and then you feel bad about that.</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.599" end="00:28:39.309" style="s2">It’s like, well, there’s some sense of<br />intrinsic morality operating at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.309" end="00:28:40.309" style="s2">of that.</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.309" end="00:28:41.309" style="s2">We’ve talked a lot about that.</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.309" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">Some of that’s built in biologically, some<br />of it is structured culturally, some of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:55.489" style="s2">is a consequence of you trying to organise<br />your… this plethora of semi-beings that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.489" end="00:28:57.059" style="s2">you are into some integrated manner.</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.059" end="00:28:59.649" style="s2">Like it’s a very, very complicated thing.</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.649" end="00:29:01.610" style="s2">It’s not just arbitrary.</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.610" end="00:29:06.619" style="s2">Okay so that’s the very background, the<br />dragon of chaos, positive and negative.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.619" end="00:29:10.309" style="s2">And it’s the thing out of which everything<br />springs.</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.309" end="00:29:16.830" style="s2">If you look at the Scandinavian world tree,<br />for example, or world trees in general, you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.830" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">very frequently have a representation of a<br />serpent that’s associated with them.</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">The reason that the… that potential is serpentine<br />is extraordinarily complicated, but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.700" end="00:29:35.989" style="s2">it’s partly because, say snakes shed their<br />own skin, so they can be reborn, so they’re</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.989" end="00:29:37.619" style="s2">a symbol of transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.619" end="00:29:42.230" style="s2">And then they’re sneaky and subtle and so<br />they appear in places that you wouldn’t</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.230" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">necessarily expect them to, and then they’re<br />a terrible, terrible threat.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">In overcoming that threat, you also develop.</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:54.389" style="s2">So not only are they a threat, but they’re<br />the kind of threat that makes you become strong</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.389" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">when you face it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:01.479" style="s2">And that’s partly why the snake is such<br />an ambivalent figure in most mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.479" end="00:30:07.909" style="s2">Okay, so that’s complicated, but we’ll<br />return to that later.</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.909" end="00:30:14.109" style="s2">And then out of that, you might say, emerges<br />the unknown as you encounter it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.109" end="00:30:20.519" style="s2">So there’s potential itself, and then the<br />first layer of potential are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.519" end="00:30:23.210" style="s2">you encounter that you don’t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.210" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">So I can give you an example of that.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:28.789" style="s2">So let’s say you’re a three-year-old,<br />or a two-year-old, that’s better, and you’re</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.789" end="00:30:31.659" style="s2">in the kitchen and a mouse runs across the<br />room.</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.659" end="00:30:36.419" style="s2">And so you track it because your eyes pick<br />up the movement, and you track the thing.</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.419" end="00:30:41.019" style="s2">And then it’s an unexpected occurrence,<br />so you don’t know what it signifies, right.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.019" end="00:30:46.669" style="s2">So that’s the emergence of something tangibly<br />unknown into your conceptual space.</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.669" end="00:30:50.809" style="s2">Now it’s not like you lack any knowledge<br />of it.</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.809" end="00:30:57.169" style="s2">You can tell what its size is, and you can<br />get some estimation of its speed.</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.169" end="00:31:01.639" style="s2">And I think what you have to do when you think<br />about whether or not something is unknown</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.639" end="00:31:06.739" style="s2">is you have to think about it in relationship<br />to that hierarchy of perception that I keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.739" end="00:31:08.139" style="s2">throwing at you.</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.139" end="00:31:17.399" style="s2">You know, if something emerges… if you encounter<br />an entity and you can map it at every single</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.399" end="00:31:20.749" style="s2">level of your value hierarchy, then it’s<br />known.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.749" end="00:31:28.959" style="s2">You know how to interact with it at a micro-level,<br />and you know what its implications are for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.959" end="00:31:32.289" style="s2">every other level of your conceptual being.</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.289" end="00:31:34.279" style="s2">You know what its implications are for the<br />future.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.279" end="00:31:37.859" style="s2">Like you know exactly how to deal with that<br />thing, it’s mapped at every single level.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.859" end="00:31:41.799" style="s2">There’s other things that are only mapped<br />at one level and not at others.</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.799" end="00:31:46.700" style="s2">So maybe the mouse, we’ll say, for the child<br />who’s never seen a mouse, it’s like…</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.700" end="00:31:52.129" style="s2">it shares some commonalities with objects<br />that the child is familiar with.</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.129" end="00:31:57.359" style="s2">But there’s sufficient novelty so that it’s<br />also contaminated with the unknown, and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.359" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">makes the child, basically, semi-startled<br />and alert.</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:08.090" style="s2">Now the child will immediately refer to an<br />adult, and it’s a technical term, actually,</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.090" end="00:32:15.219" style="s2">they’ll look at the adult’s face because<br />the adult broadcasts the motivational affective</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.219" end="00:32:16.849" style="s2">significance of that event.</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.849" end="00:32:23.190" style="s2">And so the child looks, references, and then<br />reads off the face (and of course the speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.190" end="00:32:27.549" style="s2">and the bodily actions) exactly what that<br />thing signifies.</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.549" end="00:32:31.690" style="s2">And then if the person that they’re looking<br />at jumps up on the table and screams, then</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.690" end="00:32:36.219" style="s2">that’s one sense of meaning, which is ‘God,<br />this thing is magical, it’s only this big</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.219" end="00:32:42.119" style="s2">and look at what effect it has on, you know,<br />my aunt (for the sake of argument), who’s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.119" end="00:32:46.459" style="s2">you know, a pretty competent creature as far<br />as I can tell, being two years old’.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.459" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">And then if she just dismisses it, you know,<br />her actions are going to determine the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:53.419" style="s2">of that phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.419" end="00:33:00.849" style="s2">So that’s how the transformation of the<br />semi-known thing into the more-known thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.849" end="00:33:01.849" style="s2">occurs.</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.849" end="00:33:04.830" style="s2">It occurs almost always in a social context.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.830" end="00:33:08.719" style="s2">You can explore things by yourself, but you<br />rarely actually do that by yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.719" end="00:33:14.219" style="s2">It’s almost always you plugged into a social<br />apparatus, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.219" end="00:33:19.289" style="s2">So you might be doing the specific investigating,<br />but the social apparatus is around you so</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.289" end="00:33:24.860" style="s2">that you can confer with it, and it also shapes<br />the way that you’re going to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.860" end="00:33:26.539" style="s2">that specific thing.</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.539" end="00:33:37.320" style="s2">Okay, so the unknown, that’s generally…<br />the unknown that you encounter, that’s generally</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.320" end="00:33:40.989" style="s2">characterised using feminine symbolism.</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.989" end="00:33:44.850" style="s2">And I think the reason for that, there’s<br />a bunch of reasons, and we talked about many</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.850" end="00:33:46.779" style="s2">of them.</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.779" end="00:33:51.289" style="s2">One reason is because females do the sexual<br />selection in human beings, and so they act</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.289" end="00:33:52.479" style="s2">as the face of nature.</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.479" end="00:33:59.570" style="s2">Another reason is that you can think of new<br />possibility always emerging out of the non-cultural</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">background, in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:08.510" style="s2">So for example, let’s say that we send an<br />expedition to Mars, and we’re gathering</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.510" end="00:34:10.039" style="s2">new information as a consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.039" end="00:34:14.210" style="s2">The reason we’re gathering new information<br />is because we’ve gone out past the domain</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.210" end="00:34:18.129" style="s2">of our knowledge, in a sense, and we’re<br />interacting with something new.</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.129" end="00:34:22.030" style="s2">And in that interaction, new information is<br />generated.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.030" end="00:34:26.760" style="s2">Now you can say that it’s partly the act<br />of the perceiver that’s generating the new</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.760" end="00:34:30.200" style="s2">information, and you can say that it’s partly<br />the act of the culture.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.200" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">Because we sent robots to Mars, let’s say,<br />which is very, very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">So the culture goes there but the individuals<br />are observing, so the individuals are buttressed</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:41.050" style="s2">by the culture.</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.050" end="00:34:44.929" style="s2">But they’re generating information because<br />they’re somewhere truly new.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.929" end="00:34:49.710" style="s2">And so the information… the unknown is a<br />constant source of new information.</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.710" end="00:34:52.659" style="s2">So it’s a place that gives birth to new<br />information.</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.659" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">And so that’s another part of the reason<br />that it seems to be symbolised in feminine</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">form.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:02.740" style="s2">You know, I’m just taking this, in some<br />sense, as an empirical fact.</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.740" end="00:35:07.660" style="s2">I’ve looked at… it looks like that’s<br />how these stories work.</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.660" end="00:35:11.430" style="s2">And so I’ve been trying to puzzle out why<br />exactly that would be the case.</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.430" end="00:35:16.820" style="s2">I also think it’s the case that we tend<br />to look at the world from a social cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.820" end="00:35:18.220" style="s2">perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.220" end="00:35:22.770" style="s2">We filter it through a social, cognitive,<br />biological apparatus.</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.770" end="00:35:29.099" style="s2">And so we’re very likely to see things in<br />character form, and characters have sexes,</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.099" end="00:35:31.099" style="s2">and so that’s going to happen.</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.099" end="00:35:36.569" style="s2">And then which, the attributes of femininity<br />or the attributes of masculinity, that get</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.569" end="00:35:41.800" style="s2">used as symbolic reference in some sense,<br />there’s an arbitrariness involved.</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.800" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">So for example, for the Egyptians… you know,<br />usually have a sky god, but they had a sky</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:48.200" style="s2">goddess.</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.200" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">Now, she usually represents the night sky,<br />which is not exactly the same thing as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:58.090" style="s2">day sky, but you have to... it’s so tricky<br />because you have to look at the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.090" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">between the characters in order to decide<br />what all of them mean, and that shifts a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:04.019" style="s2">bit from story to story.</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.019" end="00:36:09.559" style="s2">So this is a, what would you say, it’s an<br />approximation of the underlying structure,</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.559" end="00:36:16.180" style="s2">but there’s a fair bit of variation in it,<br />just like there’s variance in stories.</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.180" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">Well the feminine element has a destructive<br />element and a creative aspect.</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:27.269" style="s2">And you can see that people characterise their<br />environments in that way.</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.269" end="00:36:33.150" style="s2">So for example, you can map on environmental<br />beliefs onto this structure.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.150" end="00:36:42.119" style="s2">You can say that the environmentalist portrays<br />nature as positive, portrays culture as negative,</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.119" end="00:36:43.829" style="s2">and portrays the individual as negative.</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.829" end="00:36:52.650" style="s2">And the basic story is rampaging individual<br />as member of rapacious culture invading the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.650" end="00:36:56.740" style="s2">pristine landscape of beautiful Mother Nature.</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.740" end="00:37:00.350" style="s2">Now the thing about that story is it’s true.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.350" end="00:37:04.080" style="s2">The problem with that story is that it’s<br />half true.</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.080" end="00:37:08.630" style="s2">So for example, one thing that’s interesting<br />to conceptualise is that that’s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.630" end="00:37:11.510" style="s2">the opposite of the frontier myth.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.510" end="00:37:17.329" style="s2">Now the frontier myth was a story that was<br />used extensively in Europe to drive immigration</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.329" end="00:37:18.329" style="s2">into the United States.</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.329" end="00:37:20.100" style="s2">And it was used to some degree in Canada too.</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.100" end="00:37:22.970" style="s2">And so the story was the exact opposite.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.970" end="00:37:29.079" style="s2">It’s the hero, so that would be the immigrant<br />pioneer, bringing the benefits of order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.079" end="00:37:30.619" style="s2">a savage wilderness.</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.619" end="00:37:37.010" style="s2">Well that’s also true, but it’s so interesting<br />that both of those things can be true, and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.010" end="00:37:39.700" style="s2">they’re completely different from one another.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.700" end="00:37:44.760" style="s2">There’s no commonality at all between those<br />two stories, except for the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.760" end="00:37:45.920" style="s2">use the characters.</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:50.920" style="s2">There’s a feminine character, a masculine<br />character (that represents culture), and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.920" end="00:37:53.690" style="s2">there’s another character that represents<br />the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.690" end="00:37:58.500" style="s2">And you could even see that, if you think<br />about it historically, the US was founded</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.500" end="00:38:02.750" style="s2">in some sense on the frontier myth, and that<br />was to one side.</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">And so by the time the 1960s came along, the<br />early 1960s, it shifted to its opposite.</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:15.900" style="s2">And you need that, because systems have to<br />oscillate to some degree to remain stable</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.900" end="00:38:16.900" style="s2">across time.</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.900" end="00:38:18.539" style="s2">They can’t just be fixed in place.</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.539" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">So they’re going to play back and forth<br />through the archetypes in an attempt to keep</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">them balanced because that’s what you’re<br />trying to do, you’re trying to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:28.560" style="s2">balanced.</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.560" end="00:38:32.549" style="s2">And so, you have the destructive and creative<br />element of Mother Nature.</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.549" end="00:38:40.569" style="s2">You see that all the time in movies where<br />the thing that the hero is striving against</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.569" end="00:38:43.240" style="s2">is the negative element of the unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.240" end="00:38:45.539" style="s2">How many of you have seen the movie ‘Alien’?</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.539" end="00:38:51.760" style="s2">Okay so that’s a pretty graphic representation<br />of, well those aliens were more reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.760" end="00:38:59.349" style="s2">in form, so they’re almost like… they’re<br />more at the dragon of chaos level of civilisation,</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.349" end="00:39:05.490" style="s2">but they’re a terrible external force that’s<br />threatening human culture and the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.490" end="00:39:10.410" style="s2">It’s exactly the opposite story that’s<br />played out in… what was the movie with all</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.410" end="00:39:11.820" style="s2">the blue creatures?</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.820" end="00:39:13.950" style="s2">Avatar, right.</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.950" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">Avatar is exactly the opposite of that, where<br />you know, the unknown nature is just nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:24.010" style="s2">but sweetness and bliss.</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.010" end="00:39:30.740" style="s2">And the culture is portrayed as spear-headed<br />by greedy and rapacious individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.740" end="00:39:33.960" style="s2">basically manifestations of the military industrial<br />complex.</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.960" end="00:39:37.400" style="s2">The funny thing is that those both made good<br />stories.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.400" end="00:39:43.569" style="s2">And that’s because… well, it’s because<br />they have enough archetypal truth so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.569" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">there’s many situations that they’re relevant<br />to.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:52.700" style="s2">You know, sometimes Mother Nature is your<br />best friend, and sometimes it’s your worst</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.700" end="00:39:53.700" style="s2">enemy.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.700" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">And so you could go down to the jungles of<br />Peru, and you could talk to the people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:05.460" style="s2">live there, and you could find out what they<br />know about medicinal plants in the jungle,</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.460" end="00:40:08.730" style="s2">and you could bring home things to cure disease.</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.730" end="00:40:12.680" style="s2">Or you could just go down there and get lost<br />in the jungle and then you’re dead.</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.680" end="00:40:16.900" style="s2">You know in some sense it’s the same jungle.</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.900" end="00:40:22.180" style="s2">And whether it’s positive or negative depends<br />on what stance you take towards it and how</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.180" end="00:40:23.720" style="s2">you behave.</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.720" end="00:40:28.390" style="s2">And so the other thing that’s really interesting<br />about mythology, and this is the lovely element</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.390" end="00:40:33.319" style="s2">of mythology, is that part of what it does<br />is tell you how to take this incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.319" end="00:40:39.260" style="s2">landscape that’s positive and negative at<br />the same time, at every level of analysis,</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.260" end="00:40:47.849" style="s2">and how to navigate through it so that the<br />proper balance is maintained as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.849" end="00:40:53.039" style="s2">entire system is concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.039" end="00:40:57.089" style="s2">So the culture has an orderly element, and<br />that’s what protects us here, and it has</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.089" end="00:41:01.170" style="s2">a tyrannical element, and that’s what makes<br />you treated like numbers at the University</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.170" end="00:41:02.170" style="s2">of Toronto.</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.170" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">You know, you get both of those at exactly<br />the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:09.500" style="s2">And then the archetypal individual has the<br />same fundamental nature.</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.500" end="00:41:11.589" style="s2">Hero or villain.</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.589" end="00:41:16.530" style="s2">And you know those have archetypal roots,<br />because the ultimate hero is the ultimate,</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.530" end="00:41:17.530" style="s2">perfect person.</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.530" end="00:41:23.800" style="s2">And the ultimate villain is Satan himself,<br />in whatever form he happens to take.</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.800" end="00:41:32.309" style="s2">It doesn’t take much knowledge of the structure<br />before you can see it manifested all over,</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.309" end="00:41:37.160" style="s2">especially in movies that are particularly<br />popular, because they almost always have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.160" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">central archetypal theme.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:41.700" style="s2">The Marvel superhero movies are a really good<br />example of that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.700" end="00:41:47.560" style="s2">And if it’s complex literature, the archetypes<br />are mixed to some degree.</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.560" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">So you have a hero who’s not only a hero,<br />you have a hero who has all sorts of flaws.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:58.089" style="s2">And he’s in a culture, or she’s in a culture,<br />that has positive elements and negative elements</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.089" end="00:42:02.740" style="s2">and they’re in a broader landscape that’s<br />characterised by exactly the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.740" end="00:42:05.160" style="s2">So it’s nuanced.</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.160" end="00:42:08.630" style="s2">And the more sophisticated you get, the more<br />you can tolerate that kind of nuance.</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.630" end="00:42:13.099" style="s2">And I think that’s also one of the things…<br />that’s partly why literature is such a good</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.099" end="00:42:15.369" style="s2">antidote to ideology.</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.369" end="00:42:21.160" style="s2">Because the more sophisticated the literature<br />becomes, the more complex, and fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.160" end="00:42:27.809" style="s2">in some sense, or differentiated, the more<br />differentiated the archetypal landscape becomes.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.809" end="00:42:32.890" style="s2">So when someone tells you a story, whatever<br />the story happens to be, one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.890" end="00:42:36.700" style="s2">you can do when you know the substructures,<br />is you can say ‘okay yeah, but where are</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.700" end="00:42:38.860" style="s2">the missing pieces?</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.860" end="00:42:39.860" style="s2">Where are they going?’</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.860" end="00:42:43.190" style="s2">Because if they’re not included then they’re<br />generally projected onto something.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:46.789" style="s2">Because they’re there, you can’t get away<br />from them, they’re there.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.789" end="00:42:49.990" style="s2">How does the person account for them?</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.990" end="00:42:55.140" style="s2">Alright, so now I want to tell you another<br />story.</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.140" end="00:42:59.559" style="s2">So we talked about the Mesopotamian creation<br />myth last week, and now I want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.559" end="00:43:01.140" style="s2">about the Egyptian myth of sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.140" end="00:43:07.769" style="s2">And so, the first thing I should do is say<br />that all of the stories that I’m talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.769" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">to you about have all sorts of variance.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:17.230" style="s2">And so, the Egyptian story that I’m going<br />to describe lasted for thousands and thousands</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.230" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">of years, and so it isn’t like there was<br />only one variation of it, there’s all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.930" style="s2">of variations of it, and I’m only going<br />to tell you one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.930" end="00:43:29.519" style="s2">And that’s a limitation, but that’s just<br />how it is for the time being.</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.519" end="00:43:34.839" style="s2">So I’m not saying that this is the only<br />version of this story.</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.839" end="00:43:39.010" style="s2">But it’s a version, and it’s the one I’m<br />most familiar with, and so I can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.010" end="00:43:42.660" style="s2">it, hopefully with some utility.</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.660" end="00:43:44.519" style="s2">And it’s a great story.</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.519" end="00:43:48.020" style="s2">When I finally figured out what it meant…<br />it’s so cool, with some of these stories</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.020" end="00:43:53.369" style="s2">if you crack them, and you’re able to see<br />what they mean, they’re absolutely overwhelming.</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.369" end="00:43:59.230" style="s2">They’re so bloody brilliant, it’s no wonder<br />that people regard them as revelatory, you</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.230" end="00:44:04.310" style="s2">know, of divine origin, because they have<br />such power that it’s almost impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.310" end="00:44:06.069" style="s2">imagine how that could’ve got there.</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.069" end="00:44:11.160" style="s2">Now, I provide you with the Darwinian explanation<br />of how that got there, right, because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.160" end="00:44:17.869" style="s2">stories are representations of social contracts<br />and behavioural tendencies that have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.869" end="00:44:20.369" style="s2">over thousands and thousands of years.</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.369" end="00:44:25.130" style="s2">Because of that, the representation, the story’s<br />going to have way more information in it than</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.130" end="00:44:27.579" style="s2">a typical story might.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.579" end="00:44:33.570" style="s2">But I still can understand how these things<br />burst upon people with the force of revelation.</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.570" end="00:44:38.059" style="s2">One of the things that’s quite interesting<br />too, if you look at cultures historically,</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.059" end="00:44:43.369" style="s2">is that you usually find that the revelation<br />of the story… it’s like the energy source</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.369" end="00:44:45.480" style="s2">on which the culture feeds.</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.480" end="00:44:50.020" style="s2">So the story comes first, it has this tremendous<br />dynamic energy.</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.020" end="00:44:55.250" style="s2">The culture basically uses that energy to<br />propel itself through time, you know, to give</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.250" end="00:44:57.119" style="s2">itself conviction and force.</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.119" end="00:45:01.110" style="s2">And then at some point the story exhausts<br />itself, and that would be equivalent, in some</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.110" end="00:45:04.580" style="s2">sense, I suppose, to Nietzsche’s announcement<br />of the death of God.</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.580" end="00:45:07.830" style="s2">And this has happened many times.</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.830" end="00:45:14.760" style="s2">Alright, so there’s four main characters<br />in the Egyptian story.</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.760" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">There’s Osiris, Isis, Set, and Horus.</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:27.050" style="s2">Now, Osiris, we’ll start with Osiris, but<br />you could start with any of the characters,</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.050" end="00:45:31.519" style="s2">because one of the things that’s quite interesting<br />about mythology is that the myths don’t</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.519" end="00:45:35.980" style="s2">make any distinction between the causal priority<br />of these characters.</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.980" end="00:45:39.500" style="s2">Any of them can be regarded as fundamental.</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.500" end="00:45:44.599" style="s2">So the hero is the person who separates the<br />world parents for example, and brings being</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.599" end="00:45:45.720" style="s2">into existence.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.720" end="00:45:52.630" style="s2">But you can also say well it’s Tiamat, which<br />is more how the Mesopotamian creation myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.630" end="00:45:57.430" style="s2">is tilted, or you can say you can’t make<br />sense out of anything unless you have a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.430" end="00:45:59.780" style="s2">lens through which you’re looking.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.780" end="00:46:05.530" style="s2">Like there has to be some pre-existent structure<br />before information can be generated in any</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.530" end="00:46:06.530" style="s2">manner.</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.530" end="00:46:10.039" style="s2">So you’re always stuck with this problem,<br />that in order for something to exist you need</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.039" end="00:46:17.089" style="s2">a substrate, you need an interpretive substructure,<br />and you need an interpreter.</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.089" end="00:46:20.329" style="s2">And you can’t say that one of those thing<br />precedes the other.</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.329" end="00:46:23.130" style="s2">They all have to be there at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.130" end="00:46:30.809" style="s2">You could say from a Darwinian perspective,<br />they all emerged and complexified in unison</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.809" end="00:46:34.779" style="s2">as time progressed.</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.779" end="00:46:38.510" style="s2">It doesn’t explain how the origin originated,<br />however.</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.510" end="00:46:41.019" style="s2">Okay, so you’ve got Osiris.</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.019" end="00:46:45.450" style="s2">Now Osiris is the founder of the Egyptian<br />state.</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.450" end="00:46:53.700" style="s2">And so, you know, before people wrote things<br />down, you have to kind of try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.700" end="00:46:59.099" style="s2">how it was that they remembered things.</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.099" end="00:47:04.970" style="s2">Their memory was more like an amalgam, or<br />a gist.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.970" end="00:47:11.559" style="s2">So we already know that if you tell the story<br />of your actions yesterday that it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.559" end="00:47:14.569" style="s2">take you 16 hours to tell the story.</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.569" end="00:47:17.589" style="s2">Hopefully it takes you like five minutes.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.589" end="00:47:26.000" style="s2">And why that is is not obvious, but part of<br />the reason is, for whatever underlying reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.000" end="00:47:31.500" style="s2">you know what parts of the story are relevant<br />to other people, and what parts aren’t.</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.500" end="00:47:36.230" style="s2">So basically what you’re going to do is<br />try not to tell them things they already know.</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.230" end="00:47:37.829" style="s2">Because that would just be pointless.</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.829" end="00:47:42.539" style="s2">And in order to do that you more or less have<br />to know what they know and what they don’t</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.539" end="00:47:43.539" style="s2">know.</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.539" end="00:47:44.839" style="s2">And you have to more or less stay on the edge<br />of that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.839" end="00:47:45.940" style="s2">But you can do that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.940" end="00:47:51.650" style="s2">Well, I might ask you, well what did you do<br />over the last three months, or I could say</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.650" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">what have you done for the last couple of<br />years?</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">And in each case you’re going to collapse<br />that into some representation.</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:01.690" style="s2">Now imagine that the problem you’re trying<br />to solve is ‘what did your culture try to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.690" end="00:48:04.829" style="s2">do for the last five thousand years?’</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.829" end="00:48:15.279" style="s2">Well imagine that there are… the culture<br />in part is being continually informed by the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.279" end="00:48:17.589" style="s2">individuals that compose it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.589" end="00:48:22.749" style="s2">And there’re going to be different individuals<br />of different stature who discover things of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.749" end="00:48:24.069" style="s2">different importance.</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.069" end="00:48:26.549" style="s2">And we often know some people like that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.549" end="00:48:30.299" style="s2">We know of Thomas Edison, for example, and<br />we can name actual people.</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.299" end="00:48:33.850" style="s2">But that’s in part because we write things<br />down and have records of them.</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.850" end="00:48:40.599" style="s2">You can imagine though that you’re trying<br />to represent your history in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.599" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">can remember.</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">You’re going to tell stories about people<br />who have done interesting things, because</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:48.050" style="s2">that’s what you even when you tell a story<br />about yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.050" end="00:48:52.260" style="s2">So imagine you tell one story about someone<br />who did something interesting and then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.260" end="00:48:55.910" style="s2">tell another story about someone else who<br />did something interesting, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.910" end="00:49:01.779" style="s2">And that’s continually going on, let’s<br />say, in a tribal or archaic culture.</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.779" end="00:49:05.830" style="s2">So then what you get is a set of stories about<br />people doing interesting things.</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.830" end="00:49:12.690" style="s2">Well, it’s easy for that to shift into the<br />ancestors doing interesting things.</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.690" end="00:49:17.530" style="s2">And then it’s easy for that to shift into<br />the ancestor doing wonderful things.</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.530" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">And that’s basically what happens, is that<br />you get the emergence of the culture story,</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.720" end="00:49:27.779" style="s2">which is something like a small set of cultural<br />heroes who have done all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.779" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">worth doing.</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:32.279" style="s2">And what you’re doing is imitating them.</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.279" end="00:49:40.440" style="s2">And you know, this is… you know, your empirical<br />memory of events only lasts about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.440" end="00:49:41.650" style="s2">years.</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.650" end="00:49:45.009" style="s2">Because there isn’t anyone old enough to<br />remember anything past that.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.009" end="00:49:50.019" style="s2">And so what has to happen is that everything<br />that happened before that has to be collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.019" end="00:49:55.700" style="s2">into some form that’s memorable, so that<br />it can be brought forward and taught, and</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.700" end="00:49:57.710" style="s2">that’s the function of these stories.</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.710" end="00:50:03.530" style="s2">These stories actually… it’s almost as<br />if the story has abandoned everything that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.530" end="00:50:06.300" style="s2">hasn’t stuck in people’s memories.</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.300" end="00:50:10.819" style="s2">And so all that’s left is the most significant…<br />is the most significance.</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.819" end="00:50:13.830" style="s2">Because otherwise why would people bother<br />with it?</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.830" end="00:50:16.589" style="s2">They wouldn’t tell the story, they wouldn’t<br />be gripped by it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.589" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">Okay, so Osiris, he’s one of these figures.</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:25.150" style="s2">You could think… if you allowed people to<br />tell stories of George Washington, say, and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">Abe Lincoln, and all the semi-mythologised<br />founders of the United States, if you allowed</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:37.749" style="s2">people, in the absence of textbooks and writing,<br />to tell stories about those men for the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.749" end="00:50:42.869" style="s2">thousand years, maybe what you’d get out<br />of that is an origin story of the mythic founder</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.869" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">of the state.</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:48.849" style="s2">And that seems to be what’s happened in<br />the Egyptian case with Osiris.</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.849" end="00:50:55.069" style="s2">Now he’s a god, but he’s got human characteristics.</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.069" end="00:51:00.759" style="s2">And so he’s also granted the status of something<br />that’s eternal.</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.759" end="00:51:04.930" style="s2">Okay now, here’s the story of Osiris, roughly<br />speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.930" end="00:51:11.930" style="s2">He’s kind of old now, and he’s a little<br />bit blind, but he’s blind in a specific</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.930" end="00:51:12.930" style="s2">way.</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.930" end="00:51:17.319" style="s2">And the way that he’s specifically blind<br />is that he’s wilfully blind.</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.319" end="00:51:23.070" style="s2">Now if you’re wilfully blind about… the<br />Egyptians say this straightforwardly, and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.070" end="00:51:24.589" style="s2">I’ll tell you why they believe this.</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.589" end="00:51:29.099" style="s2">If you’re wilfully blind there’s things<br />that you could know that you take pains not</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.099" end="00:51:30.549" style="s2">to know.</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.549" end="00:51:37.579" style="s2">And wilful blindness, under English common<br />law, can be grounds for criminal conviction.</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.579" end="00:51:43.230" style="s2">So for example, if you run a company and you<br />think that your treasurer is cooking the books</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.230" end="00:51:48.779" style="s2">but it’s working to your favour, and you<br />decide ‘well, I just won’t look’, and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.779" end="00:51:52.330" style="s2">then later it comes out, you could say ‘well<br />I didn’t know’, and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.330" end="00:51:56.630" style="s2">prosecuting would say ‘yeah but you could<br />have known and you took a conscious choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.630" end="00:51:59.609" style="s2">not to know, so you’re culpable.’</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.609" end="00:52:03.999" style="s2">And I think that’s actually the best model<br />of Freudian repression, in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.999" end="00:52:09.500" style="s2">It isn’t exactly repression, it is failure<br />to make the effort to know something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.500" end="00:52:11.150" style="s2">you could know.</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.150" end="00:52:13.480" style="s2">Now, sometimes you…</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.480" end="00:52:17.720" style="s2">look, sometimes something terrible happens<br />to you and you just can’t understand it.</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.720" end="00:52:21.630" style="s2">But sometimes something terrible is happening<br />and you refuse to think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.630" end="00:52:26.570" style="s2">And because you refuse to think about it you<br />really don’t know what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.570" end="00:52:30.190" style="s2">And you might say, ‘well I can’t be culpable<br />then because I don’t know what it is’,</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.190" end="00:52:33.619" style="s2">but you could have known, so you’re culpable.</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.619" end="00:52:36.269" style="s2">So it’s voluntary ignorance.</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.269" end="00:52:38.299" style="s2">And that’s the problem with Osiris.</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.299" end="00:52:40.740" style="s2">He was a great guy when he was young, he was<br />a hero.</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.740" end="00:52:43.490" style="s2">He founded the Egyptian state.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.490" end="00:52:46.650" style="s2">But you know he’s not everything he could<br />be anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.650" end="00:52:52.099" style="s2">He’s gotten anachronistic and outdated and<br />wilfully blind, which is even worse.</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.099" end="00:52:53.460" style="s2">Now there’s an idea here.</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.460" end="00:52:56.930" style="s2">It’s such a bloody brilliant idea, it’s<br />mindboggling.</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.930" end="00:53:05.559" style="s2">So Osiris is the state manifested in personified<br />form, and that’s reasonable, because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.559" end="00:53:07.609" style="s2">state is like a person.</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.609" end="00:53:15.670" style="s2">The person of the state is manifested in the<br />body of laws, and you guys all imitate that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.670" end="00:53:27.540" style="s2">body of laws, and that’s what basically<br />makes you citizens of the state.</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.540" end="00:53:29.609" style="s2">So that’s what makes you citizens of the<br />state.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.609" end="00:53:33.190" style="s2">You can all get along because all of you are<br />imitating the same thing, and what you’re</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.190" end="00:53:39.240" style="s2">imitating is the central body of custom and<br />law that makes up the state.</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.240" end="00:53:41.420" style="s2">And that’s why you can predict each other.</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.420" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">So that makes you a good citizen.</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:48.170" style="s2">Now the problem with being a good citizen<br />is that sometimes if you’re a good citizen</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.170" end="00:53:49.630" style="s2">you’re a bad person.</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.630" end="00:53:51.109" style="s2">That’s a big problem.</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.109" end="00:53:57.400" style="s2">So for example, the better you were at being<br />a Nazi, in all likelihood, the worse a person</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.400" end="00:53:58.530" style="s2">you were.</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.530" end="00:54:03.900" style="s2">And so that’s a very useful observation,<br />because one of the things it shows is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.900" end="00:54:10.329" style="s2">even though it’s necessary for you to imitate<br />the central personality of the state, sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.329" end="00:54:13.869" style="s2">the central personality of the state can be<br />pathological.</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.869" end="00:54:19.819" style="s2">And the Egyptians, who had established quite<br />a lengthy state (as opposed, say, to the Mesopotamians…</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.819" end="00:54:26.200" style="s2">the Egyptians had been existing in a complex<br />state apparatus for a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.200" end="00:54:31.490" style="s2">time), they started to encounter problems<br />that were intrinsic to the state.</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.490" end="00:54:36.920" style="s2">Now you remember, in the Mesopotamian creation<br />myth, the primary danger was Tiamat.</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.920" end="00:54:41.859" style="s2">You know, you make a lot of racket, you kill<br />Apsu, that’s order, Tiamat comes flooding</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.859" end="00:54:42.990" style="s2">back and takes you out.</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.990" end="00:54:47.150" style="s2">Well you can imagine that that would be the<br />primary story of people in a civilisation</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.150" end="00:54:48.400" style="s2">that was somewhat fragile.</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.400" end="00:54:52.970" style="s2">They’re a hell of a lot more worried about<br />being invaded by the next, you know, round</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.970" end="00:54:57.140" style="s2">of barbarians, or having their crops fail,<br />or being flooded out or something like that,</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.140" end="00:55:01.579" style="s2">than they are concerned about whether or not<br />the whole state apparatus has become corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.579" end="00:55:02.619" style="s2">and is going to collapse.</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.619" end="00:55:06.619" style="s2">Now they’re partly concerned about that,<br />because remember Marduk, the emperor, is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.619" end="00:55:11.849" style="s2">to be being a good Marduk and keeping an eye<br />on everything.</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.849" end="00:55:17.339" style="s2">But the myth, the mythic structure only talks<br />about Apsu a tiny little bit, it basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.339" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">says ‘don’t kill Tiamat’s consort or<br />you’ll make her angry’.</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:24.829" style="s2">The Egyptians take that a lot farther.</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.829" end="00:55:27.900" style="s2">They look at Osiris and they say ‘well he<br />was… there was something really good about</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.900" end="00:55:28.900" style="s2">him.</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.900" end="00:55:33.010" style="s2">Without him we wouldn’t even have our state,<br />so we bloody well better be happy about that,</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.010" end="00:55:36.460" style="s2">because the state is better than no state’.</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.460" end="00:55:41.410" style="s2">You know, you could say pathological order<br />is better than absolute chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.410" end="00:55:45.690" style="s2">Now you can have an argument about that but…<br />whatever, it’s, you know, it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.690" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">how pathological the order, obviously.</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:52.289" style="s2">But it isn’t that untrammeled chaos is a<br />good solution.</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.289" end="00:55:58.579" style="s2">I think that you can, and I’m only using<br />this as an example… you know, the Americans,</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.579" end="00:56:06.499" style="s2">and us as well, went into Iraq to take out<br />a person who was clearly a dictator.</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.499" end="00:56:12.190" style="s2">And who had… who was a pretty bad guy and<br />who had really bad sons.</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.190" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">And his heroes were people like Stalin and<br />Hitler.</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:17.569" style="s2">Well, they took him out.</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.569" end="00:56:19.780" style="s2">Well then what?</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.780" end="00:56:23.609" style="s2">Well, then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.609" end="00:56:28.410" style="s2">You know, because the theory was, you take<br />out the bad guy at the top and all the good</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.410" end="00:56:31.609" style="s2">guys at the bottom get together and instantly<br />they have a good government.</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.609" end="00:56:35.299" style="s2">It’s like, that isn’t what happened at<br />all, what happened was the whole state degenerated</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.299" end="00:56:36.450" style="s2">into chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.450" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">And partly out of that chaos came ISIS, and<br />it’s not self-evident that ISIS is preferable</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:43.569" style="s2">to Hussein.</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.569" end="00:56:51.300" style="s2">At least Hussein educated all the women, and<br />he was relatively secular, all things considered.</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.300" end="00:56:57.940" style="s2">So I’m not making a case for Hussein, my<br />point is that, you know, you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.940" end="00:57:02.549" style="s2">when you disrupt order, even when it’s pathological,<br />because God only knows what’s going to spring</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.549" end="00:57:03.549" style="s2">forth.</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.549" end="00:57:07.509" style="s2">And that doesn’t mean that you should never<br />try to overcome pathological order, but it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.509" end="00:57:11.170" style="s2">does mean that you should be very, very careful<br />when you do so.</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.170" end="00:57:14.970" style="s2">You know, you have to do a micro-analysis<br />in some sense to make sure that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.970" end="00:57:18.460" style="s2">the hell you’re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.460" end="00:57:22.599" style="s2">Alright so anyways, Osiris, he’s a good<br />guy man, he established the state, he was</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.599" end="00:57:28.890" style="s2">a great guy, he was a hero, he, you know,<br />made order out of chaos, and that’s where</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.890" end="00:57:29.890" style="s2">you live, so great.</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.890" end="00:57:36.299" style="s2">But he’s a little old, a little out of date,<br />and he’s wilfully blind, and that’s so</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.299" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">smart because I think what the Egyptians did<br />is encapsulate in narrative form the primary</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:44.650" style="s2">danger of all human institutions.</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.650" end="00:57:46.109" style="s2">There’s two of them.</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.109" end="00:57:50.099" style="s2">And Eliade talks about this a lot with regards<br />to flood mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.099" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">So here’s an example.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:55.559" style="s2">There are flood myths all over the world,<br />and there may have even been a flood, there’s</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.559" end="00:58:00.049" style="s2">pretty good archeological evidence for that,<br />that there was a great flood about 13,000</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.049" end="00:58:04.749" style="s2">years ago, when a bunch of comets hit the<br />Earth and melted the North American ice shield,</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.749" end="00:58:05.749" style="s2">but we won’t get into that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.749" end="00:58:10.670" style="s2">But it doesn’t really matter, because the<br />mythological sub-structure of the story still</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.670" end="00:58:15.009" style="s2">has the same meaning regardless of its historical<br />reality.</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.009" end="00:58:20.200" style="s2">So in the Biblical story of the flood, basically<br />what happens is that humanity is created,</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.200" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">then they degenerate rapidly.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:27.329" style="s2">And they get so degenerate, which is sort<br />of like the elder Gods getting out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.329" end="00:58:31.579" style="s2">in the Mesopotamian story, that God thinks,<br />‘oh to hell with all of you, you’re a</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.579" end="00:58:35.009" style="s2">big mistake, I’m just going to wipe you<br />out’.</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.009" end="00:58:40.369" style="s2">But he finds one good guy, that’s Noah,<br />and out of Noah, who’s like another Adam,</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.369" end="00:58:43.700" style="s2">in some sense, the world of human beings is<br />regenerated.</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.700" end="00:58:50.759" style="s2">But the idea is that corrupt people get washed<br />away.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.759" end="00:58:56.049" style="s2">And Eliade talks about the flood myth all<br />over the world, Mircea Eliade, and he says</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.049" end="00:59:02.519" style="s2">that generally speaking there’s two reasons<br />why the deities flood the planet.</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.519" end="00:59:07.319" style="s2">And one is the system is old and out-dated,<br />and the second is that people are corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.319" end="00:59:10.829" style="s2">And then if you get the two things working<br />together, you get a system that’s out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.829" end="00:59:15.059" style="s2">date that becomes pathological faster because<br />people are corrupt.</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.059" end="00:59:19.999" style="s2">And so I think that you can use the flood<br />in New Orleans as a good example of that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.999" end="00:59:24.410" style="s2">Because on the one hand you can say, well<br />it was a hurricane.</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.410" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">So that’s a natural disaster.</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:32.109" style="s2">But on the other hand you could say, well<br />people knew the damn dykes were too weak,</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.109" end="00:59:36.180" style="s2">and they didn’t do anything about it, you<br />know, they were only built for a hundred year</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.180" end="00:59:37.180" style="s2">storm.</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.180" end="00:59:42.280" style="s2">And Louisiana is corrupt beyond belief, I<br />mean, for a democratic state, it’s not corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.280" end="00:59:45.960" style="s2">compared to most states, but it’s really<br />corrupt compared to most democratic states,</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.960" end="00:59:49.789" style="s2">and if you dump money into Louisiana it just<br />goes into people’s pockets anyways and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.789" end="00:59:51.960" style="s2">infrastructure doesn’t get fixed up.</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.960" end="00:59:55.850" style="s2">So then you might ask yourself, well was the<br />flood a consequence of a natural disaster,</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.850" end="00:59:58.000" style="s2">or the blindness of the culture?</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.000" end="01:00:00.930" style="s2">Well, you can never tell which of those are<br />true.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.930" end="01:00:06.460" style="s2">If you freeze to death in the winter is it<br />because it’s cold or because you’re stupid?</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.460" end="01:00:10.809" style="s2">You know, there’s no difference between<br />those two things.</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.809" end="01:00:15.789" style="s2">So if you get wiped out, it’s because nature<br />comes after you and because your culture isn’t</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.789" end="01:00:17.640" style="s2">sufficient to protect.</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.640" end="01:00:19.880" style="s2">And so you can’t separate those two things.</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.880" end="01:00:26.220" style="s2">Okay, so… now the other case that the Egyptians<br />are making, and this is quite cool, is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.220" end="01:00:32.760" style="s2">if you take a system that’s doing just fine,<br />and you just leave it alone long enough, it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.760" end="01:00:35.109" style="s2">becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.109" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">And there is a bunch of reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:43.190" style="s2">I mean, you know, you can imagine that you<br />take your laptop, and it’s in perfect working</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.190" end="01:00:48.349" style="s2">order, and you put it in the closet for twenty<br />years, and you take it out, what do you have?</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.349" end="01:00:50.550" style="s2">Well, it’ll still turn on.</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.550" end="01:00:52.330" style="s2">Do you have a laptop?</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.330" end="01:00:58.390" style="s2">Well no, by then it won’t even work, it<br />won’t be able to communicate with the internet,</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.390" end="01:01:02.470" style="s2">there won’t be any peripherals that could<br />plug into it, the software would be so outdated</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.470" end="01:01:03.989" style="s2">that you wouldn’t even know how to use it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.989" end="01:01:06.170" style="s2">Like it’s a brick, basically.</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.170" end="01:01:11.710" style="s2">And so the point is that, and you can really<br />see this with electronic equipment, a perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.710" end="01:01:18.269" style="s2">functional thing, maintained in stasis, of<br />its own accord becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.269" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">And so what that means is that you have to<br />run around like a mad hyena just keeping your</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:24.450" style="s2">things working.</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.450" end="01:01:29.390" style="s2">Now of course you know that, because how much<br />time do you spend in a month updating your</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.390" end="01:01:30.390" style="s2">electronics?</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.390" end="01:01:33.309" style="s2">You know, it’s just a treadmill of updates.</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.309" end="01:01:37.930" style="s2">I think part of the reason they haven’t<br />contributed to overall productivity is because</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.930" end="01:01:43.759" style="s2">people take all the time they used to waste<br />typing things out on paper trying to keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.759" end="01:01:47.030" style="s2">their efficient electronics actually working.</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.030" end="01:01:50.239" style="s2">And you know, learning all the things you<br />have to learn and re-learning them.</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.239" end="01:01:53.299" style="s2">There’s this scene in Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.299" end="01:01:56.890" style="s2">So Alice is in the Underworld, right?</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.890" end="01:01:59.059" style="s2">And she meets the Red Queen down there.</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.059" end="01:02:00.059" style="s2">So that’s Mother Nature.</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.059" end="01:02:02.749" style="s2">And she’s always running around going ‘off<br />with their heads!</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.749" end="01:02:07.380" style="s2">Off with their heads!’ in an arbitrary way,<br />which is of course what the Red Queen does.</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.380" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">And at one point she tells Alice, which is<br />such a… it’s such a remarkably deep line,</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:19.790" style="s2">she says to Alice ‘in my Kingdom you have<br />to run as fast as you can just to stay in</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.790" end="01:02:20.910" style="s2">the same place.’</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.910" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">And that’s exactly right.</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.390" end="01:02:29.109" style="s2">So you can think, the environment that you’re<br />trying to adapt to is a dynamic concatenation</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.109" end="01:02:32.589" style="s2">of patterns and it’s transforming across<br />time.</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.589" end="01:02:36.839" style="s2">Not completely unpredictably, but certainly<br />not predictably.</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.839" end="01:02:42.220" style="s2">And so that means if you build a structure<br />that’s adapted to it, that structure has</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.220" end="01:02:47.599" style="s2">to change and flow in keeping with the change<br />and flow of the underlying environment or</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.599" end="01:02:49.400" style="s2">it gets outdated.</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.400" end="01:02:52.940" style="s2">You know, it gets obsolescent.</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.940" end="01:02:57.280" style="s2">And so all you have to do is sit there and<br />do nothing and you become obsolescent.</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.280" end="01:03:00.730" style="s2">And so that’s the problem with Osiris being<br />old.</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.730" end="01:03:05.519" style="s2">He was a good guy when he was young, but he’s<br />old now, and the old solutions don’t solve</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.519" end="01:03:07.099" style="s2">the new problems.</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.099" end="01:03:12.390" style="s2">And you could call that an Egyptian existential<br />statement.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.390" end="01:03:14.369" style="s2">All of you have a culture.</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.369" end="01:03:16.210" style="s2">It’s old.</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.210" end="01:03:17.210" style="s2">It doesn’t apply.</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.210" end="01:03:18.460" style="s2">Or it doesn’t apply well.</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.460" end="01:03:20.579" style="s2">And so what are you going to do with it?</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.579" end="01:03:22.309" style="s2">Are you going to throw the whole thing out?</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.309" end="01:03:26.529" style="s2">Well we know what happens, the Mesopotamians<br />already told us what happens if you do that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.529" end="01:03:30.989" style="s2">It’s like, Tiamat comes flooding back and<br />all hell breaks loose, so you can’t throw</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.989" end="01:03:35.800" style="s2">everything away, but it doesn’t work very<br />well, so it’s up to you to figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.800" end="01:03:38.839" style="s2">to fix it.</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.839" end="01:03:42.220" style="s2">Okay so… but now Osiris has got another<br />problem.</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.220" end="01:03:50.770" style="s2">So you might say… well let’s say you’ve<br />got an old computer (this, by the way [points</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.770" end="01:03:56.220" style="s2">to computer], in case you haven’t noticed,<br />is a very old computer), and if you keep tapping</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.220" end="01:04:00.190" style="s2">on it, and upgrading it a little bit, you<br />could keep it more or less up-to-date.</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.190" end="01:04:02.460" style="s2">At some point you’re going to throw the<br />whole damn thing away.</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.460" end="01:04:07.559" style="s2">But you could do incremental changes to it<br />on a continual basis, and the thing will more</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.559" end="01:04:09.589" style="s2">or less stay functional.</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.589" end="01:04:15.140" style="s2">You could think about those incremental changes<br />as partial revolutions, right?</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.140" end="01:04:17.240" style="s2">Remember that hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.240" end="01:04:19.589" style="s2">Now and then you have to change the operating<br />system.</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.589" end="01:04:24.170" style="s2">That sucks, because that means everything<br />operating underneath virtually has to change.</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.170" end="01:04:30.099" style="s2">But more often you’re doing a tweak here<br />and a tweak there, at lower, more specific</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.099" end="01:04:34.839" style="s2">levels, and if you tweak enough then the probability<br />that the whole thing is going to collapse</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.839" end="01:04:37.779" style="s2">and you’ll have to do a clean install is<br />quite low.</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.779" end="01:04:41.700" style="s2">Well the same thing applies to the state,<br />logically enough.</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.700" end="01:04:43.619" style="s2">This is the state.</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.619" end="01:04:47.109" style="s2">If you think that your laptop isn’t the<br />state then you’re not thinking about your</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.109" end="01:04:48.359" style="s2">laptop properly.</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.359" end="01:04:49.619" style="s2">It’s the state.</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.619" end="01:04:55.819" style="s2">And it’s going to be more and more the state<br />as we progress over the next twenty years.</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.819" end="01:04:59.789" style="s2">So you know that if you’re aware and you<br />keep the updates up and you stay awake that</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.789" end="01:05:01.650" style="s2">you can keep the thing functioning.</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.650" end="01:05:05.400" style="s2">At some point it’s going to get anachronistic,<br />it’s better to just replace it, which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.400" end="01:05:08.400" style="s2">also by the way what’s going to happen to<br />all of you, right?</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.400" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">And it’s a decision that evolution, in some<br />sense, and biology has made, that at some</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:20.059" style="s2">point trying to keep you updated is so bloody<br />complicated that you might as well get rid</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.059" end="01:05:24.680" style="s2">of the whole thing and let something new occur,<br />and I’m really dead serious about this,</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.680" end="01:05:26.810" style="s2">because death evolved.</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.810" end="01:05:31.239" style="s2">You know, you have elements in you that are<br />three and a half billion years old.</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.239" end="01:05:32.920" style="s2">Not everything dies.</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.920" end="01:05:38.309" style="s2">And some creatures are functionally immortal.</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.309" end="01:05:39.309" style="s2">But not us.</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.309" end="01:05:43.150" style="s2">And the reason is, well at some point we’re<br />too old to be updated, and so that’s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.150" end="01:05:45.869" style="s2">end of that.</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.869" end="01:05:49.569" style="s2">Seems to happen about over a hundred year<br />period.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.569" end="01:05:55.010" style="s2">Anyways, now imagine you just ignore your<br />computer completely.</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.010" end="01:05:57.499" style="s2">You don’t update the thing at all.</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.499" end="01:06:06.109" style="s2">Well, it’s going to get anachronistic of<br />its own accord, but if you refuse to engage</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.109" end="01:06:11.160" style="s2">in those operations that would keep it updated,<br />it’s going to get anachronistic a lot faster.</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.160" end="01:06:14.069" style="s2">And that’s what happens to Osiris, they<br />say the same thing.</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.069" end="01:06:20.190" style="s2">It’s like, he’s old, and that’s part<br />of the problem, he’s past his prime.</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.190" end="01:06:23.180" style="s2">But the worst part of the problem is that<br />he’s wilfully blind.</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.180" end="01:06:28.119" style="s2">He won’t take action even though he knows<br />it’s necessary.</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.119" end="01:06:33.910" style="s2">And so he gets out of date and pathological<br />faster than necessary.</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.910" end="01:06:39.740" style="s2">Now when you hear in the flood stories that<br />God is angry about the sins of men, and that’s</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.740" end="01:06:42.059" style="s2">why He washes everything away, it’s the<br />same idea.</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.059" end="01:06:48.410" style="s2">Now the word ‘sin’ comes from the Greek<br />word hamartia, and hamartia is an archery</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.410" end="01:06:49.410" style="s2">term.</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.410" end="01:06:52.549" style="s2">And to sin means not to hit the centre of<br />the target.</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.549" end="01:06:58.880" style="s2">And so basically the idea in the flood stories<br />is that if enough people aren’t aiming at</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.880" end="01:07:04.499" style="s2">the target, or hitting the centre, then things<br />are going to get so corrupt and unstable that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.499" end="01:07:06.500" style="s2">everything is going to get washed away.</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.500" end="01:07:11.539" style="s2">And that’s right, it’s exactly, perfectly<br />accurate.</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.539" end="01:07:12.989" style="s2">Which is very, very cool.</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.989" end="01:07:14.930" style="s2">It’s remarkable that that’s the case.</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.930" end="01:07:20.910" style="s2">Okay, so now Osiris (because this is a myth)<br />has an evil brother.</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.910" end="01:07:22.119" style="s2">Now that’s a pretty common occurrence.</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.119" end="01:07:27.041" style="s2">If you look at The Lion King (which is very<br />much the Egyptian creation myth, by the way),</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.041" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">the Lion King… what’s the old guy’s<br />name?</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:34.339" style="s2">The old lion.</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.339" end="01:07:36.549" style="s2">Mufasa.</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.549" end="01:07:37.859" style="s2">He has a brother, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.859" end="01:07:39.019" style="s2">What’s his brother?</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.019" end="01:07:40.019" style="s2">Scar!</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.019" end="01:07:41.970" style="s2">And what’s the problem with Scar?</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.970" end="01:07:43.569" style="s2">He’s scarred.</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.569" end="01:07:50.119" style="s2">Right, so you know, he says he’s from the<br />bottom of the gene pool.</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.119" end="01:07:56.490" style="s2">And you know, he’s been in second place<br />all his life, and he’s very, very intelligent.</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.490" end="01:07:58.359" style="s2">He worships his own intelligence.</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.359" end="01:08:03.319" style="s2">He regards himself as a higher form of intellect,<br />which is a very common characteristic of evil</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.319" end="01:08:07.190" style="s2">brother is mythology, and there’s a reason<br />for that.</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.190" end="01:08:10.100" style="s2">And he’s scarred because life has scarred<br />him.</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.100" end="01:08:14.180" style="s2">And he’s bitter and resentful and he wants<br />to bring down the order and he wants to kill</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.180" end="01:08:15.180" style="s2">the son of the king.</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.180" end="01:08:18.359" style="s2">I mean, he’s a bad guy.</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.359" end="01:08:22.900" style="s2">Now the problem is that Mufasa underestimates<br />him, and that’s exactly what happens to</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.900" end="01:08:23.900" style="s2">Osiris.</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.900" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">So Osiris has this brother, Set, or Seth.</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:32.699" style="s2">And I’ve a sneaking suspicion that our word<br />‘set’, for setting Sun is from that word,</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.699" end="01:08:34.739" style="s2">although I don’t know that for sure.</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.739" end="01:08:42.089" style="s2">But sounds are generally… sounds in language<br />remain stable across a very long period of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.089" end="01:08:47.549" style="s2">time, and set was definitely, from the Egyptian<br />perspective, the enemy of the Sun.</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.549" end="01:08:51.739" style="s2">You know, that’s part of the Egyptian cosmology.</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.739" end="01:08:56.310" style="s2">And the Sun is associated with illumination<br />and brightness and daytime consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.310" end="01:08:58.530" style="s2">clear apprehension and vision, and all those<br />things.</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.530" end="01:09:03.819" style="s2">And of course night is opposed to that, unconsciousness<br />and blindness and danger, and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.819" end="01:09:05.859" style="s2">things.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.859" end="01:09:11.679" style="s2">So anyways, Set, he’s pretending to be Osiris’s<br />loving brother, but he’s not.</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.679" end="01:09:14.850" style="s2">He’s plotting to overthrow him first chance<br />he gets.</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.850" end="01:09:19.750" style="s2">And so he’s just sitting in the background,<br />feeding him bad advice, waiting for him to</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.750" end="01:09:22.330" style="s2">get weak enough so that he can strike.</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.330" end="01:09:28.389" style="s2">Now the name Set is taken by the Egyptian<br />Coptics and turned into Satan.</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.389" end="01:09:31.920" style="s2">So Set is the precursor of the Christian Satan.</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.920" end="01:09:37.449" style="s2">So the reason I’m telling you that is so<br />that you can see how these ideas, these archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.449" end="01:09:45.589" style="s2">ideas of corruption and evil are extraordinarily<br />ancient, and they’re part of the process</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.589" end="01:09:50.120" style="s2">whereby people are trying to figure out what<br />the right way is to act and what the wrong</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.120" end="01:09:54.139" style="s2">way is to act, and what the right way is to<br />set up institutions and what the wrong way</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.139" end="01:09:56.400" style="s2">is to set up institutions.</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:09:58.619" style="s2">So it’s a very, very long process.</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.619" end="01:10:02.780" style="s2">And it’s not something that someone just<br />sat around and thought up.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.780" end="01:10:05.800" style="s2">It’s way, way deeper than that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.800" end="01:10:12.250" style="s2">So anyways, Osiris is being, you know, getting<br />weaker and being blind, and one day Set thinks</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.250" end="01:10:17.179" style="s2">‘alright, time for action’, so he takes<br />his brother and he chops him up into little</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.179" end="01:10:18.179" style="s2">pieces.</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.179" end="01:10:24.230" style="s2">Now, Osiris is a god, so you’re not going<br />to kill him, but you can make it very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.230" end="01:10:26.650" style="s2">for him to get his act together.</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.650" end="01:10:29.810" style="s2">So basically what happens is Osiris falls<br />apart.</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.810" end="01:10:32.670" style="s2">Now think about that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.670" end="01:10:35.080" style="s2">You fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.080" end="01:10:36.219" style="s2">People say that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.219" end="01:10:37.770" style="s2">The relationship fell apart.</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.770" end="01:10:39.320" style="s2">I fell apart.</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.320" end="01:10:40.780" style="s2">Things fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.780" end="01:10:41.940" style="s2">What does that mean?</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.940" end="01:10:50.110" style="s2">Well it means that a thing is usually a complex<br />unity of multiple sub-entities, and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.110" end="01:10:55.341" style="s2">what holds them together, the superordinate<br />structure, collapses, and all that’s left</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.341" end="01:10:56.341" style="s2">are the things.</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.341" end="01:11:01.970" style="s2">Because you know, when you fall apart, you<br />don’t completely fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.970" end="01:11:02.970" style="s2">You know, you’re still alive.</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.970" end="01:11:08.120" style="s2">What’s happened is that the unity of your<br />psychological structure has been fragmented.</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.120" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">And that’s a trip to the underworld, man.</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:11.730" style="s2">So you’re going to be unhappy.</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.730" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">I broke up with my partner and then I fell<br />apart.</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:16.690" style="s2">Well everyone knows what that means.</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.690" end="01:11:20.400" style="s2">Okay, so that’s what happens to Osiris.</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.400" end="01:11:22.199" style="s2">Things fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.199" end="01:11:28.060" style="s2">So then Set, being a sneaky sort of character,<br />takes all of Osiris’s pieces and he puts</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.060" end="01:11:29.060" style="s2">them all over Egypt.</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.060" end="01:11:34.610" style="s2">He hides them here and there so that Osiris<br />is going to have a hell of a time recollecting</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.610" end="01:11:38.349" style="s2">himself and getting his act together and coming<br />back.</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.349" end="01:11:41.389" style="s2">And so, things fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.389" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">Now the same thing happens in The Lion King,<br />obviously, because Scar kills Mufasa.</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:55.200" style="s2">So fine, then Set rules.</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.200" end="01:11:57.670" style="s2">That’s not a good day for the Egyptians.</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.670" end="01:12:02.090" style="s2">Remember what happens in The Lion King when<br />Scar rules?</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.090" end="01:12:05.900" style="s2">The environment becomes completely devastated<br />because they overhunt, right?</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.900" end="01:12:08.380" style="s2">So you get total environmental devastation.</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.380" end="01:12:11.050" style="s2">It’s all black and burnt.</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.050" end="01:12:13.239" style="s2">And, you know, nothing is functioning properly.</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.239" end="01:12:18.360" style="s2">And remember after Simba comes back to set<br />things right it starts to rain and everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.360" end="01:12:20.260" style="s2">comes back to life.</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.260" end="01:12:25.670" style="s2">Well it’s another indication of the idea<br />that you really can’t separate the environment</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.670" end="01:12:31.500" style="s2">from the culture, you know, they’re in a<br />dynamic system of interaction.</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.500" end="01:12:35.030" style="s2">Anyways, Osiris, things have fallen apart.</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.030" end="01:12:39.420" style="s2">Well Osiris has a wife, he has to, he’s<br />King of Order.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.420" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">Well, we’re missing someone, we’re missing<br />the Queen of Chaos, we’re missing the Queen</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:44.199" style="s2">of the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.199" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">That’s Isis.</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:47.590" style="s2">Now Isis was a long-lasting goddess.</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.590" end="01:12:50.590" style="s2">There’s been goddess religions forever.</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.590" end="01:12:59.800" style="s2">There’s an idea among misinformed feminist<br />anthropologists that the original religious</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.800" end="01:13:05.570" style="s2">structures were feminine, earth-goddess type<br />religions, and then they were replaced by</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.570" end="01:13:07.500" style="s2">patriarchal religions.</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.500" end="01:13:10.250" style="s2">And there’s no historical evidence for that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.250" end="01:13:15.000" style="s2">And the best work I know on that is actually<br />through the Jungians…</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.000" end="01:13:16.950" style="s2">Jung and Eric Neumann.</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.950" end="01:13:20.420" style="s2">Because what they figured out… they’re<br />kind of on the same track, thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.420" end="01:13:25.080" style="s2">the same idea, that there seems to be a shift<br />between matriarchal values to patriarchal</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.080" end="01:13:27.739" style="s2">values, and that that was a historical shift.</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.739" end="01:13:32.099" style="s2">But what they actually found out instead was<br />that’s a shift in mythological idea.</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.099" end="01:13:34.530" style="s2">It’s not a historical reality.</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.530" end="01:13:38.570" style="s2">And it’s useful as a mythological idea but<br />you shouldn’t project it backwards onto</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.570" end="01:13:41.030" style="s2">time and make it a historical reality.</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.030" end="01:13:45.860" style="s2">Anyways, Isis, she’s been Queen of the Underworld<br />forever.</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.860" end="01:13:50.260" style="s2">Now of course, when order collapses, chaos<br />reappears, and that’s what happens.</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.260" end="01:13:55.420" style="s2">Isis pops up out of the Underworld and her<br />husband’s missing and she’s not very happy</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.420" end="01:13:56.420" style="s2">about that.</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.420" end="01:14:00.840" style="s2">So she wanders all over Egypt looking for<br />his phallus.</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.840" end="01:14:11.010" style="s2">And so… now that’s an interesting idea,<br />because it touches on the biology of innovation,</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.010" end="01:14:12.010" style="s2">in some sense.</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.010" end="01:14:15.989" style="s2">So you’ve heard of the notion of a seminal<br />idea.</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.989" end="01:14:21.730" style="s2">Well, that’s a mythologically informed metaphor.</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.730" end="01:14:29.980" style="s2">And so the idea is that, in biological reproduction,<br />semen falls on fertile ground, and out of</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.980" end="01:14:32.580" style="s2">that something emerges.</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.580" end="01:14:41.050" style="s2">Well, there’s a tight analogue between that<br />and what happens in the Egyptian myth with</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.050" end="01:14:42.290" style="s2">regards to sexuality.</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.290" end="01:14:46.710" style="s2">Now, Jung and Freud had a big argument about<br />this, eh, because Freud thought that you could</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.710" end="01:14:51.580" style="s2">reduce everything to sexuality.</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.580" end="01:14:56.630" style="s2">And Jung said no no, what you don’t understand<br />is that sexuality itself is often used as</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.630" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">a symbol for something even more profound.</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:04.710" style="s2">And they didn’t agree on that, and that’s<br />part of why they went their separate ways.</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.710" end="01:15:11.219" style="s2">Freud was very much unwilling to believe that<br />religion could be anything other than a set</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.219" end="01:15:18.070" style="s2">of defensive and repressive beliefs and practices<br />designed to protect you from death anxiety.</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.070" end="01:15:23.380" style="s2">That was basically his hypothesis.</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.380" end="01:15:25.680" style="s2">And it’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.680" end="01:15:29.570" style="s2">I mean, there is that element, of course,<br />because you can use dogma to protect yourself</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.570" end="01:15:32.090" style="s2">against all sorts of things.</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.090" end="01:15:34.679" style="s2">But you can’t reduce a whole damn thing<br />to that.</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.679" end="01:15:41.390" style="s2">You have got to watch people of any type,<br />that are intellectuals, who will tell you</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.390" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">that everything can be reduced to one cause.</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.360" style="s2">You know, it’s like a misplaced monotheism.</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.360" end="01:15:49.360" style="s2">Lots of people do that.</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.360" end="01:15:54.150" style="s2">For Marx it’s economics or class warfare,<br />for Freud it’s sexuality (although he also</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.150" end="01:15:56.730" style="s2">considers aggression), for Foucault it’s<br />power.</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.730" end="01:16:00.130" style="s2">You know, it’s like no, it’s not that<br />simple.</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.130" end="01:16:03.680" style="s2">You can make a good story out of those motivations,<br />because they’re powerful motivations, and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.680" end="01:16:08.630" style="s2">they do affect everything, but that doesn’t<br />mean they cause everything uni-dimensionally.</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.630" end="01:16:14.300" style="s2">Okay, so anyways, Isis pops up, Queen of the<br />Underworld, Set takes control, chaos emerges</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.300" end="01:16:20.599" style="s2">from the Underworld, Isis wanders around,<br />she finds Osiris’s phallus, and she makes</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.599" end="01:16:21.599" style="s2">herself pregnant.</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.599" end="01:16:23.540" style="s2">Well, so what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.540" end="01:16:26.190" style="s2">Well, it means a lot of things.</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.190" end="01:16:32.140" style="s2">One thing it means is that if a great system<br />falls apart, the parts still have life.</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.140" end="01:16:34.730" style="s2">And, you know, you could think about that.</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.730" end="01:16:39.320" style="s2">People often talk about the stability (to<br />the degree that it’s stable)… part of</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.320" end="01:16:46.119" style="s2">the stability of capitalism is its creative<br />destruction.</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.119" end="01:16:50.250" style="s2">Capitalism allows great enterprises to collapse<br />and disperse.</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.250" end="01:16:54.420" style="s2">But they don’t break down into sub-atomic<br />particles, right?</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.420" end="01:16:59.670" style="s2">They collapse but the pieces they collapse<br />into still have life, some of them more than</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.670" end="01:17:00.670" style="s2">others.</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.670" end="01:17:04.520" style="s2">And then if something collapses, sometimes<br />part of the thing that collapsed has enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.520" end="01:17:07.650" style="s2">life to build something new out of the pieces.</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.650" end="01:17:12.949" style="s2">That’s the same thing that happens to you<br />when you undergo a radical, revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.949" end="01:17:15.690" style="s2">transformation in your character.</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.690" end="01:17:17.989" style="s2">You might even feel like you’re dying.</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.989" end="01:17:23.530" style="s2">And in some sense the organising principles<br />by which you lived are dying.</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.530" end="01:17:25.210" style="s2">That’s what’s taking you out.</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.210" end="01:17:26.530" style="s2">And it’s painful.</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.530" end="01:17:28.710" style="s2">Those things are alive.</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.710" end="01:17:33.220" style="s2">It’s no trivial matter to be taken apart.</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.220" end="01:17:37.880" style="s2">But you know, you hope that you get taken<br />apart, you can find some new information down</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.880" end="01:17:42.869" style="s2">there in the chaos, and that’s your union<br />with Isis, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.869" end="01:17:48.110" style="s2">And out of that union of information from<br />the chaos and the parts of you that are left,</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.110" end="01:17:50.010" style="s2">you could come springing back.</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.010" end="01:17:54.150" style="s2">And everyone hopes that, and often it’s<br />the case.</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.150" end="01:17:58.340" style="s2">You know, one of the lessons you can derive<br />from Egyptian mythology is bloody well stay</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.340" end="01:17:59.420" style="s2">awake.</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.420" end="01:18:01.719" style="s2">And make the little corrections when you need<br />to.</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.719" end="01:18:06.810" style="s2">Don’t be wilfully blind, because if you’re<br />wilfully blind you’re going to store up</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.810" end="01:18:10.489" style="s2">chaos, because you’re not keeping it at<br />bay.</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.489" end="01:18:13.970" style="s2">And then one day when you’re weak it’s<br />just going to take you out.</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.970" end="01:18:14.970" style="s2">And that happens.</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.970" end="01:18:16.880" style="s2">That happens to people all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.880" end="01:18:23.080" style="s2">They let things around them degenerate back<br />into chaos.</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.080" end="01:18:26.630" style="s2">And then one day they’re weak, and something<br />else comes along to hit them, and they’re</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.630" end="01:18:27.630" style="s2">done.</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.630" end="01:18:28.630" style="s2">They can’t get up.</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.630" end="01:18:30.350" style="s2">It’s too heavy and too hard a hit.</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.350" end="01:18:35.950" style="s2">And so then they’re down in the Underworld<br />and they stay there.</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.950" end="01:18:39.030" style="s2">The general rule is if you’re going to go<br />to the Underworld, it’s better to go on</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.030" end="01:18:41.739" style="s2">purpose and for short voyages.</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.739" end="01:18:45.490" style="s2">And that’s the idea behind voluntary exposure,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.490" end="01:18:47.300" style="s2">Find out what you don’t want to look at.</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.300" end="01:18:51.610" style="s2">It’s easy enough to do that, because you’re<br />going to see yourself avoiding it.</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.610" end="01:18:56.880" style="s2">Then figure out how you can approach it and<br />order some of it, in as big chunks as you</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.880" end="01:18:57.969" style="s2">can manage.</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.969" end="01:19:00.320" style="s2">And you can do that all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.320" end="01:19:01.610" style="s2">Stay awake.</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.610" end="01:19:06.780" style="s2">Because then you keep your infrastructure<br />properly maintained, and the probability that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.780" end="01:19:10.280" style="s2">you will tolerate a powerful blow is much,<br />much higher.</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.280" end="01:19:11.560" style="s2">It’s not certain.</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.560" end="01:19:13.409" style="s2">That’s the other thing about myths.</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.409" end="01:19:19.380" style="s2">They tell you the best way to negotiate through<br />life, but they never tell you that that will</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.380" end="01:19:20.510" style="s2">work.</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.510" end="01:19:23.619" style="s2">They just tell you that that’s your best<br />bet.</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.619" end="01:19:26.030" style="s2">And so yeah, maybe that’s enough.</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.030" end="01:19:27.460" style="s2">It might be enough.</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.460" end="01:19:34.530" style="s2">Okay, anyways, so Isis finds Osiris’s phallus,<br />and gets pregnant.</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.530" end="01:19:37.070" style="s2">And then back to the Underworld she goes.</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.070" end="01:19:40.110" style="s2">And she goes through her pregnancy and she<br />gives birth to Horus.</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.110" end="01:19:42.060" style="s2">Now that’s a pretty common story, right?</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.060" end="01:19:46.630" style="s2">That’s the long lost rightful king.</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.630" end="01:19:51.199" style="s2">You know, in King Arthur, for example, Arthur<br />has to be taken away from the castle to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.199" end="01:19:52.860" style="s2">raised, basically in isolation.</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.860" end="01:19:55.400" style="s2">It’s a very, very common story.</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.400" end="01:19:57.199" style="s2">And the reason… the same thing happens Harry<br />Potter, right?</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.199" end="01:20:06.290" style="s2">Harry Potter is stuck with these Dursleys<br />and they just… they’re like every resentful</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.290" end="01:20:10.370" style="s2">child’s image of their parents.</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.370" end="01:20:13.970" style="s2">Maybe it’s more like every resentful 13-year-old’s<br />image of their parents.</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.970" end="01:20:21.289" style="s2">And you know, the truth of the matter is that<br />you are kind of stuck off in the normative</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.289" end="01:20:23.449" style="s2">wastelands of your culture.</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.449" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">You have your specific parents, they’re<br />not archetypal representatives of reality,</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:30.460" style="s2">they’re your parents.</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.460" end="01:20:36.320" style="s2">They’re nature and culture, but in finite<br />and flawed human form.</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:42.829" style="s2">And what that means in part is you are raised<br />outside the domain of your culture.</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.829" end="01:20:48.260" style="s2">It’s old, it isn’t working very well,<br />and it’s not transmitted very well to you.</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.260" end="01:20:52.230" style="s2">So you grow up outside of it, you’re alienated<br />from it.</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.230" end="01:20:59.290" style="s2">That’s that existential alienation, but<br />people have always felt alienated from their</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.290" end="01:21:04.350" style="s2">damn culture, because it’s old, and it’s<br />sort of blind.</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.350" end="01:21:08.290" style="s2">And there you are young and dynamic and full<br />of life and all it’s telling you is you</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.290" end="01:21:09.929" style="s2">can do this and you can’t do that.</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.929" end="01:21:14.800" style="s2">And then you know, lying to you about some<br />things, and doing a pretty nasty job of others.</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:17.250" style="s2">So you’re outside it, you’re alienated<br />from it.</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.250" end="01:21:18.590" style="s2">And that’s what happens to Horus.</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.590" end="01:21:20.230" style="s2">He’s outside, in the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.230" end="01:21:21.489" style="s2">That’s where he gets born.</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.489" end="01:21:24.540" style="s2">And so that’s worth thinking about too.</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.540" end="01:21:27.250" style="s2">Anyways, he grows up.</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.250" end="01:21:30.099" style="s2">Now Horus is an interesting sort of character.</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.099" end="01:21:34.030" style="s2">So you’ve all seen the image of the Egyptian<br />eye, right?</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.030" end="01:21:35.030" style="s2">Everyone knows that image.</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.030" end="01:21:36.270" style="s2">Even now, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.270" end="01:21:40.650" style="s2">So it’s got an eyebrow and it’s got an<br />eye in the middle and then it’s got the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.650" end="01:21:45.710" style="s2">iris, and usually the pupil is so big that<br />it covers the whole iris.</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.710" end="01:21:50.389" style="s2">And there’s a variety of reasons for that,<br />but one of the reasons is that it symbolises</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.389" end="01:21:51.389" style="s2">interest and attention.</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.389" end="01:21:54.050" style="s2">So when you’re interested in something,<br />your pupil grows.</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.050" end="01:21:58.630" style="s2">And so Horus’s pupil is really big, and<br />he’s checking things out like mad.</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.630" end="01:22:02.700" style="s2">So Horus is the eye, and he’s also a falcon.</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.700" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">And you might say, well why is he a falcon?</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:10.290" style="s2">And the answer to that is falcons are birds<br />of prey, and they can really see.</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.290" end="01:22:14.770" style="s2">So that’s another amplification of the idea<br />of the eye.</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.770" end="01:22:19.079" style="s2">Now falcons fly up above everything, even<br />above the pyramids.</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.079" end="01:22:23.900" style="s2">And they can see wherever they want to see,<br />and so Horus is the thing that flies up above</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.900" end="01:22:29.410" style="s2">the structures of mankind, in some sense,<br />and can see them panoramically.</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.410" end="01:22:33.949" style="s2">So he’s not encapsulated in any particular<br />pyramid, he’s the thing that’s above all</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.949" end="01:22:39.830" style="s2">pyramids and looking and providing you with<br />an overview.</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.830" end="01:22:43.880" style="s2">And I think the best way to conceptualise<br />Horus in modern terms is attention.</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.880" end="01:22:49.199" style="s2">That’s not thought, that’s a whole different<br />thing.</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.199" end="01:22:55.960" style="s2">Like attention is what thought… attention<br />is the precursor to thought, in some sense.</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.960" end="01:23:01.440" style="s2">Attention is where you meet meaning, and that’s<br />another way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.440" end="01:23:07.150" style="s2">Attention is actually where you take undifferentiated<br />chaos and start to turn it into order.</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.150" end="01:23:11.239" style="s2">And you think about… how much do you like<br />being paid attention to?</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.239" end="01:23:12.239" style="s2">People love that.</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.239" end="01:23:15.480" style="s2">Children, you don’t pay attention to them,<br />they become pathological.</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.480" end="01:23:18.739" style="s2">You don’t pay attention to your partner,<br />your relationship dissolves.</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.739" end="01:23:21.970" style="s2">No one pays attention to you, you crawl off<br />in a corner and die.</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.970" end="01:23:25.070" style="s2">Advertisers pay for your attention.</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.070" end="01:23:30.630" style="s2">Like attention, that’s a currency, man,<br />that’s value.</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.630" end="01:23:35.000" style="s2">And you like to be paid attention to when<br />you do good things, and maybe you’ll even</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.000" end="01:23:38.360" style="s2">do terrible things so that someone pays attention<br />to you.</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.360" end="01:23:39.360" style="s2">Attention’s a big deal.</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.360" end="01:23:40.880" style="s2">We don’t understand it very well.</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.880" end="01:23:44.770" style="s2">But anyways, the Egyptians conceptualised<br />it as a god.</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.770" end="01:23:48.159" style="s2">And that’s smart, that’s a very smart<br />idea.</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.159" end="01:23:53.449" style="s2">Anyways, Horus grows up in the Underworld,<br />and then when he gets kind of big and ready</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.449" end="01:23:57.880" style="s2">to contend with the world, he thinks I’m<br />going to take the damn state back from my</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.880" end="01:23:58.880" style="s2">evil uncle.</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.880" end="01:24:02.590" style="s2">Well, that’s what you’re supposed to do.</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.590" end="01:24:07.690" style="s2">You’re supposed to grow up, pay attention,<br />get yourself the hell out of the Underworld,</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.690" end="01:24:11.630" style="s2">and then take your state back from your evil<br />uncle.</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.630" end="01:24:13.250" style="s2">Okay, so what happens?</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.250" end="01:24:15.130" style="s2">So Horus, he gets himself all prepared.</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.130" end="01:24:22.599" style="s2">And he’s son of Order and Chaos, man, he’s<br />no second-rate character.</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.599" end="01:24:26.020" style="s2">You remember… how many of you have seen<br />The Avengers movies?</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.020" end="01:24:27.020" style="s2">Okay.</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.020" end="01:24:31.860" style="s2">Okay so I think it’s Samuel Jackson, right?</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.860" end="01:24:37.099" style="s2">Samuel Jackson is often in the background,<br />and if I remember correctly he’s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.099" end="01:24:41.450" style="s2">like the mediator between these shadowy figures<br />that sort of exist as…</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.450" end="01:24:45.989" style="s2">I don’t know, they all look like middle-aged<br />white men and they’re sort of like a power</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.989" end="01:24:51.110" style="s2">group and they communicate on screen, I don’t<br />know exactly who they are.</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.110" end="01:24:52.920" style="s2">But Jackson plays an intermediary.</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.920" end="01:24:55.610" style="s2">But he is lacking an eye.</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.610" end="01:25:00.020" style="s2">And part of the reason, you infer, that Jackson<br />is lacking an eye is because he’s had a</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.020" end="01:25:04.090" style="s2">pretty long history of being involved in catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.090" end="01:25:07.850" style="s2">And you know, one consequence of that is that<br />he’s become damaged.</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.850" end="01:25:10.900" style="s2">Well, the same thing happens to Horus.</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.900" end="01:25:15.389" style="s2">So Horus goes back and he says to Set, I see<br />you for who you are.</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.389" end="01:25:17.469" style="s2">I know what you’re up to.</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.469" end="01:25:19.260" style="s2">You’re working for destruction.</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.260" end="01:25:20.900" style="s2">You want to take the state apart.</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.900" end="01:25:23.190" style="s2">There’s nothing positive about what you’re<br />doing.</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.190" end="01:25:25.630" style="s2">You facilitate deception.</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.630" end="01:25:26.699" style="s2">So I’m taking the state back.</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.699" end="01:25:30.190" style="s2">So they have a big fight.</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.190" end="01:25:33.270" style="s2">And during the fight, Set tears out one of<br />Horus’s eyes.</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.270" end="01:25:37.800" style="s2">Now that’s worth thinking about too, because<br />what it means (and this is exactly right)…</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.800" end="01:25:41.599" style="s2">you know, one of the things Jung said about<br />encountering malevolence.</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.599" end="01:25:49.050" style="s2">It’s like, let’s say that you wanted to<br />understand what the Nazis did.</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.050" end="01:25:51.320" style="s2">And so you started to take it apart.</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.320" end="01:25:55.670" style="s2">And at each little bit of exploration you<br />take it apart a little bit more deeply, and</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.670" end="01:25:58.130" style="s2">then a little bit more deeply, and then a<br />little bit more deeply.</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.130" end="01:26:00.010" style="s2">You want to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.010" end="01:26:04.710" style="s2">Well you might ask yourself, well what’s<br />at the bottom of terrible things?</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.710" end="01:26:09.489" style="s2">Well the answer to that… an answer to that…<br />is the archetype of evil.</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.489" end="01:26:18.590" style="s2">And if you are to the degree that you encounter<br />that, even if you’re capable of god-like</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.590" end="01:26:24.280" style="s2">attention, which is the case with Horus, the<br />probability is that that will be so devastating</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.280" end="01:26:27.460" style="s2">that it will destroy half your consciousness.</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.460" end="01:26:29.180" style="s2">That’s what happens to Horus.</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.180" end="01:26:32.550" style="s2">And so that’s another thing I really like<br />about the myths, man.</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.550" end="01:26:34.120" style="s2">They don’t mess around.</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.120" end="01:26:37.099" style="s2">You’re supposed to come out of the Underworld,<br />you’re supposed to see what the hell’s</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.099" end="01:26:42.739" style="s2">going on, you’re supposed to go back and<br />take the state away from its archaic institutions</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.739" end="01:26:43.940" style="s2">and wilful blindness.</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.940" end="01:26:49.340" style="s2">But if you really contend with that, you better<br />look out, because you’re contending with</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.340" end="01:26:53.150" style="s2">something that you can barely master.</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.150" end="01:26:59.090" style="s2">Anyways, Horus beats Set, despite the fact<br />that he has his eye torn out.</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.090" end="01:27:03.929" style="s2">And so then he tell Set to go outside the<br />boundaries of the Kingdom and to never come</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.929" end="01:27:04.929" style="s2">back.</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.929" end="01:27:07.800" style="s2">Well, why doesn’t he kill him?</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.800" end="01:27:09.210" style="s2">Well he can’t, he’s a god.</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.210" end="01:27:10.719" style="s2">You can’t get rid of Set.</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.719" end="01:27:14.930" style="s2">Set is the deity of the decomposition of states.</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.930" end="01:27:17.300" style="s2">That’s not going away.</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.300" end="01:27:20.940" style="s2">The best you can do is hold it at bay for<br />periods of time.</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.940" end="01:27:24.730" style="s2">And you have to be awake and aware of its<br />constant presence.</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.730" end="01:27:30.389" style="s2">Anyways, he chases Set away but he gets his<br />eye back.</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.389" end="01:27:38.639" style="s2">And so he reclaims his consciousness from<br />malevolence, essentially.</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.639" end="01:27:40.840" style="s2">And then you might think, okay, well what<br />should he do?</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.840" end="01:27:46.369" style="s2">He should slap that eye back in his head,<br />and he’s defeated evil, so now he should</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.369" end="01:27:47.369" style="s2">be king.</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.369" end="01:27:50.579" style="s2">And that would be a good ending to the story,<br />but that isn’t what the Egyptians do, and</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.579" end="01:27:56.489" style="s2">this is where they really get brilliant, in<br />my estimation.</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.489" end="01:28:00.290" style="s2">So Horus takes his eye, and he goes back to<br />the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.290" end="01:28:01.880" style="s2">So he does this voluntarily.</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.880" end="01:28:03.980" style="s2">He goes back to the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.980" end="01:28:08.719" style="s2">And he goes back to where Osiris is existing,<br />because it’s sort of the land of the dead.</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.719" end="01:28:11.139" style="s2">And so Osiris has this weird existence.</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.139" end="01:28:18.300" style="s2">He’s scattered all over Egypt, but his essence,<br />I suppose, his spirit, is down there in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.300" end="01:28:21.880" style="s2">Underworld, which is… it’s not exactly<br />hell.</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.880" end="01:28:23.630" style="s2">Hell is a suburb of the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.630" end="01:28:27.469" style="s2">Like it’s the worst neighbourhood of the<br />Underworld, that’s a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.469" end="01:28:28.469" style="s2">about it.</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.469" end="01:28:30.909" style="s2">You guys go to the Underworld fairly often.</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.909" end="01:28:36.119" style="s2">You may take a rare side-trip to hell, and<br />you probably regret it.</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.119" end="01:28:40.520" style="s2">And we can talk about that means, because<br />it actually has a very specific meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.520" end="01:28:43.349" style="s2">Anyways, Osiris isn’t in hell, he’s just<br />in the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.349" end="01:28:48.420" style="s2">So he’s sitting there sort of, you know,<br />inactive.</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.420" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">And in rough shape.</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:58.790" style="s2">So Horus goes down to the Underworld, and<br />he finds Osiris, and he gives him an eye!</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.790" end="01:29:00.719" style="s2">And so then Osiris can see again.</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.719" end="01:29:03.820" style="s2">Remember, he couldn’t see, he was wilfully<br />blind, right?</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.820" end="01:29:05.730" style="s2">And so that’s partly what led to his demise.</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.730" end="01:29:09.889" style="s2">Horus give him this eye that’s been hard<br />fought.</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.889" end="01:29:13.110" style="s2">It’s the eye with which he encountered evil.</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.110" end="01:29:16.970" style="s2">He gives Osiris that eye, perks him right<br />up.</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.970" end="01:29:24.820" style="s2">And so then Horus and Osiris go back to the<br />surface world, and they unite to form the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.820" end="01:29:26.790" style="s2">ruler of Egypt.</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.790" end="01:29:31.830" style="s2">And so the idea is that the proper ruler is<br />obviously the thing that can pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.830" end="01:29:36.849" style="s2">and conquer the pathology of the state and<br />wilful blindness, but it’s more that.</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.849" end="01:29:41.619" style="s2">It’s the thing that does that and then rejuvenates<br />the state.</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.619" end="01:29:52.400" style="s2">And you know, one of the things, I think this<br />is quite interesting… so the hippie culture</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.400" end="01:29:58.400" style="s2">in the 1960s was a revolutionary culture,<br />and you can make a case that during the 60s,</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.400" end="01:30:03.820" style="s2">and the latter part of the 50s, young people’s<br />attention was very much focused on certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.820" end="01:30:05.989" style="s2">pathological elements of the state.</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.989" end="01:30:10.340" style="s2">You know, the Civil Rights Movement seemed<br />to be a real thing, there was a movement towards</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.340" end="01:30:15.920" style="s2">emancipation of women, there were lots of<br />things that I think you can look at from a</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.920" end="01:30:19.050" style="s2">distance and say, you know, good work.</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.050" end="01:30:25.449" style="s2">But then there was the other element of it,<br />which was, well, you know, down with the state</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.449" end="01:30:27.060" style="s2">and don’t trust anyone over 30.</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.060" end="01:30:31.260" style="s2">Well, that’s kind of stupid, because first<br />of all it’s not that long till you’re</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.260" end="01:30:32.880" style="s2">30 and then what do you do?</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.880" end="01:30:37.460" style="s2">And second, well no, you can’t throw the<br />damn baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.460" end="01:30:40.380" style="s2">I mean first of all, you’re probably doing<br />that because you don’t want to grow up,</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.380" end="01:30:41.380" style="s2">ever.</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.380" end="01:30:42.650" style="s2">You’re just Peter Pan.</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.650" end="01:30:50.270" style="s2">And second, it’s like, you can’t leave<br />Osiris languishing in the Underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.270" end="01:30:53.330" style="s2">You have to give him vision and bring him<br />back up to the surface.</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.330" end="01:30:59.310" style="s2">Because I don’t care how attentive you are,<br />if you’re also not wise you’re not going</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.310" end="01:31:00.830" style="s2">to be good for anything.</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.830" end="01:31:05.960" style="s2">And the wisdom is partly the integration of<br />the best your culture has to offer you into</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.960" end="01:31:12.060" style="s2">your character, so that you can be an avatar<br />of culture, an attentive avatar of culture.</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.060" end="01:31:13.590" style="s2">And then you’re a well-balanced soul.</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.590" end="01:31:16.639" style="s2">Well, so the Egyptians figured all this out.</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.639" end="01:31:23.910" style="s2">And then it’s even cooler than that, because<br />they used this idea of the union of Horus</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.910" end="01:31:31.869" style="s2">and Osiris as their conceptual representation<br />of what gave the Pharaoh sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.869" end="01:31:35.540" style="s2">Because again, like the Mesopotamians, they<br />were trying to figure out, well what should</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.540" end="01:31:36.540" style="s2">rule?</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.540" end="01:31:38.500" style="s2">What should be above all?</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.500" end="01:31:42.099" style="s2">And the Mesopotamians figured, well it’s<br />something like Marduk, he’s got lots of</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.099" end="01:31:45.030" style="s2">eyes, he can talk, he’s brave, he’ll conquer<br />the unknown.</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.030" end="01:31:48.760" style="s2">As a consequence, he makes a pretty good top<br />god.</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.760" end="01:31:56.000" style="s2">And the Egyptians added a level of sophistication<br />to that, because Horus is not only the thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.000" end="01:32:00.510" style="s2">that will go into the Underworld, he goes<br />into the Underworld and he rescues things</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.510" end="01:32:08.429" style="s2">of tremendous value and then unites with them,<br />so that not only can he see, but he’s wise.</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.429" end="01:32:10.340" style="s2">And so then that’s what the Pharaoh is supposed<br />to be.</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.340" end="01:32:14.850" style="s2">And the Egyptians basically characterised<br />that union as something akin to the immortal</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.850" end="01:32:15.850" style="s2">soul.</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.850" end="01:32:20.950" style="s2">Now, Eliade tracks this development, he called<br />it the ‘democratisation of Osiris’.</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.950" end="01:32:27.120" style="s2">So first of all, basically only the Pharaoh<br />was allowed to be the Horus-Osiris union in</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.120" end="01:32:28.120" style="s2">some sense.</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.120" end="01:32:35.469" style="s2">And so in a way he was God on Earth, you know,<br />which is a conception of course that has lasted</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.469" end="01:32:37.590" style="s2">into cultures for a very, very long period<br />of time.</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.590" end="01:32:41.869" style="s2">And the Japanese still thought that way about<br />their emperor until the end of World War II.</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.869" end="01:32:43.369" style="s2">Many of them still think that way.</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.369" end="01:32:46.449" style="s2">So he was the embodiment of divine sovereignty.</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.449" end="01:32:49.170" style="s2">It was in the leader only.</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.170" end="01:32:55.320" style="s2">But as the Egyptian state developed, the idea<br />that that soul was an attribute started to</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.320" end="01:32:57.130" style="s2">descend down the power hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.130" end="01:33:00.400" style="s2">So after a while the aristocracy started to<br />use it.</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.400" end="01:33:08.360" style="s2">And then, and this is a radical oversimplification,<br />but it’ll do for the purposes of this discussion,</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.360" end="01:33:14.170" style="s2">you know by the time the Jews came along,<br />and they came out of Egypt (mythologically</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.170" end="01:33:20.210" style="s2">speaking), the idea that there could be a<br />union or a relationship between something</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.210" end="01:33:24.320" style="s2">that was divine and something that was individual<br />was distributed a long ways down the power</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.320" end="01:33:26.260" style="s2">hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.260" end="01:33:30.310" style="s2">And then by the time the Greeks showed up,<br />well in some sense it was all males, at least</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.310" end="01:33:31.949" style="s2">all males who were part of the polity.</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.949" end="01:33:36.050" style="s2">And when the Christians emerged, it was everyone.</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.050" end="01:33:41.870" style="s2">Prostitutes, tax collectors, thieves, murderers,<br />everyone.</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.870" end="01:33:46.640" style="s2">And so the idea of sovereignty started to<br />become, you know first of all it was a mythological</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.640" end="01:33:51.219" style="s2">attribute, it was identified with the ruler,<br />but then it became a psychological attribute</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.219" end="01:33:53.630" style="s2">that was distributed across the entire population.</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.630" end="01:33:54.950" style="s2">It’s brilliant.</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.950" end="01:33:56.270" style="s2">It’s brilliant!</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.270" end="01:34:03.630" style="s2">And as far as I can tell, those conceptualisations<br />formed the sub-structure of our belief that</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.630" end="01:34:07.909" style="s2">each person is divinely valuable, in their<br />own right.</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.909" end="01:34:12.530" style="s2">That they have inalienable rights, even if<br />you’re a murderer, right, the state is very</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.530" end="01:34:14.710" style="s2">restricted in what it can do to you.</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.710" end="01:34:20.619" style="s2">Even if you committed a terrible crime, even<br />if you admit to it, the state is still very</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.619" end="01:34:23.020" style="s2">restricted in what it’s allowed to do to<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.020" end="01:34:30.590" style="s2">Because there’s an idea that there’s something<br />about you that has the quality of transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.590" end="01:34:31.590" style="s2">value.</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.590" end="01:34:32.590" style="s2">That’s exactly it.</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.590" end="01:34:35.389" style="s2">And well, we know some of the attributes.</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.389" end="01:34:40.050" style="s2">One of them is you can see and pay attention<br />and another is that you can speak and communicate.</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.050" end="01:34:46.119" style="s2">You know, the other is that you can become<br />wise, that you can approach things that frighten</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.119" end="01:34:49.800" style="s2">you with courage, and generate new information<br />as a consequence.</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.800" end="01:34:55.929" style="s2">Like there’s lots of things about you that<br />the relationship between Chaos and Order actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.929" end="01:34:59.040" style="s2">literally depend upon.</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.040" end="01:35:06.449" style="s2">And so the state has come to respect the individual<br />partly because the individual is, by necessity,</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.449" end="01:35:08.469" style="s2">the thing that rejuvenates the state.</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.469" end="01:35:11.450" style="s2">And so there’s this dynamic relationship<br />between the two.</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.450" end="01:35:15.960" style="s2">The state structures you, but it’s old and<br />it’s blind, and there’s lots of things</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.960" end="01:35:18.579" style="s2">it can’t see, and it’s partly corrupt.</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.579" end="01:35:23.090" style="s2">Okay, but it’s hell of a lot better than<br />nothing, generally speaking, and so then you’re</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.090" end="01:35:27.079" style="s2">like the forerunner of the state, and you<br />can pay attention.</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.079" end="01:35:30.059" style="s2">Maybe you can see where things aren’t working<br />exactly right, where they’re not working</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.059" end="01:35:32.159" style="s2">properly, and fix them.</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.159" end="01:35:38.090" style="s2">And so then the state maintains its protective<br />structure across time and you exist in a dialectical</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.090" end="01:35:39.760" style="s2">relationship with it.</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:46.639" style="s2">You know, you see by the time the Christian<br />hero mythology emerges, Christ is more the</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.639" end="01:35:52.059" style="s2">reconstructor of the state than he is the<br />thing that encounters chaos, right?</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.059" end="01:35:58.060" style="s2">Because a huge chunk of the Christian story<br />is about the antagonism between him and his</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.060" end="01:36:00.320" style="s2">culture and the Roman culture as well.</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.320" end="01:36:07.461" style="s2">So the whole existential drama actually shifts<br />from hero as buttressing against nature, which</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.461" end="01:36:12.960" style="s2">of course would have been the case earlier,<br />to hero as thing that decomposes and reconstructs</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.960" end="01:36:15.119" style="s2">culture in a radical way.</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.119" end="01:36:21.300" style="s2">So you know, Moses does the same thing, and<br />Moses is a master of water, he’s a transformative</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.300" end="01:36:26.579" style="s2">agent, so it’s an indication of exactly<br />the same sort of idea.</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.579" end="01:36:33.719" style="s2">That’s a good time for a break.</p>
