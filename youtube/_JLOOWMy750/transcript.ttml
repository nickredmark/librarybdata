<p begin="00:00:00.469" end="00:00:04.200" style="s2">okay so most of the people who are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.639" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">be watching this video know what the</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:07.589" style="s2">Dunbar number is because I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:11.630" style="s2">about it before I want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">Dunbar number both as very arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.630" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">that one of the characteristics or few</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:18.270" style="s2">is that to me it&#39;s like the four-minute</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:19.800" style="s2">mile one of the reasons we don&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.270" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">it is because we think we can&#39;t break it</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.800" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">and once we do many groups will be able</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">to break it but just like the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">four-minute mile that doesn&#39;t mean all</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:31.260" style="s2">of humanity is then able to break it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:33.210" style="s2">just the top groups the top people in</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.260" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">those groups but the more were able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.210" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">create the infrastructure to do that to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">look at what are the constraints the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:40.590" style="s2">Dunbar number why does it exist and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:45.950" style="s2">can we get beyond it because most Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.590" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">groups are random in most traits but one</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.950" end="00:00:52.050" style="s2">so you&#39;re born to a group of people but</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">you&#39;re genetics within that group your</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.050" end="00:00:57.539" style="s2">personality type your argue are going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:00:59.309" style="s2">be different and so you didn&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.539" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">that and even if you do choose it if</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.309" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">it&#39;s like your workplace you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:05.540" style="s2">choose the rest of what comes along with</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">it right who your workplace hires</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.540" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">outside of that so because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">randomized assortment of people I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">like that&#39;s gonna naturally constrain</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">the number but what I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:23.090" style="s2">is the relationship between the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">number and these other two numbers so</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.090" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">you can&#39;t have an effective team with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">the Dunbar number you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">hundred and fifty people having a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">conversation or 150 people know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">going on in a single project without it</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">being a broadcast project right with</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">like one or two people being the leaders</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">and telling everyone else what to do but</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">in an effective group you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">come to consensus you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">conversation where everyone as everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">is heard and has a turn to speak and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.500" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a larger number a</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">greater number that is everyone every</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">individual no matter how unique they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:04.950" style="s2">how much of an outlier they are can</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">hopefully find their effective group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.950" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">people and also hopefully their Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">group but you&#39;re really an outlier yt3</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:15.810" style="s2">you know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:17.420" style="s2">to nine other people might be here Holy</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.810" end="00:02:19.739" style="s2">Grail</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.420" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s also of course the individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.739" end="00:02:28.769" style="s2">the individual acts as a node in all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:31.410" style="s2">them but especially in how many groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.769" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">they are part of in the effective number</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.410" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">and then what number are those teams of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:40.530" style="s2">are those effective teams all part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">the same Dunbar group or are they part</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.530" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">of multiple Dunbar groups the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:47.099" style="s2">multiple Dunbar groups our individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">nodes are what connect us to make the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.099" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">Dunbar number greater to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">solve problems on the greater number</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">scale or between two thousand and ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:57.569" style="s2">million people what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">infrastructure do we need in place to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.569" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">able to solve problems on that number on</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">that level to be able to effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">create groups that are the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">and effective teams that are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:11.250" style="s2">effective number I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">explained that all well but I would love</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.250" end="00:03:15.930" style="s2">to get together and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:17.819" style="s2">concept of how do we what is the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.930" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">number and why does it exist and how can</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.819" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">we possibly break it as well as in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:25.859" style="s2">format of like what makes an effective</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">team what level of rules do you want on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.859" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">each level right if you my guess is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">rules kind of exist on the Dunbar level</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">and then effective teams can can you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">have some wiggle room on those rules but</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:43.799" style="s2">they still have to follow the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">teams rules that they&#39;re a part of even</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.799" end="00:03:48.060" style="s2">if there&#39;s a little bit of leeway and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:50.069" style="s2">the less rules that are in the greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.060" end="00:03:51.959" style="s2">number level the better so that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.069" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">can form a Dunbar group that works for</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.959" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">them they can find it if they the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:58.230" style="s2">greater number is very stringent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">already a constraint with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.230" end="00:04:01.290" style="s2">involved right it&#39;s only going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">greater number of people who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.290" end="00:04:06.450" style="s2">to follow those rules and so the less</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">rules on the greater number team yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.450" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">just that rules exist on don&#39;t run over</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">and then the more were able to create</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:18.120" style="s2">the logistics the infrastructure to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:20.609" style="s2">able to grow the Dunbar number to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.120" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">able to effectively work on the teams do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.609" end="00:04:25.020" style="s2">able to find the teams find the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">number the it changes all of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.020" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">and so I would like to get together and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">talk about the Dunbar number so I will</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.650" style="s2">create a doodle pool for people who want</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">to talk about this especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.650" end="00:04:40.139" style="s2">game be space as we are beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">Dunbar number what does it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.139" end="00:04:44.669" style="s2">be have a greater number to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">have people in teams how can we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.669" end="00:04:49.139" style="s2">non broadcast way of making decisions</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.160" end="00:04:52.800" style="s2">within the confinements and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.139" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">logistical issues like time zones and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.800" end="00:05:01.020" style="s2">geography and different abilities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:02.520" style="s2">challenges like how what could that look</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.020" end="00:05:06.180" style="s2">like I have some ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.520" end="00:05:07.080" style="s2">I met the ideas so if you that interests</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.180" end="00:05:08.430" style="s2">you and you want to have a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.080" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">conversation about the Dunbar number</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.430" end="00:05:14.690" style="s2">this greater number and this effective</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:14.690" style="s2">number please answer the dutiful thanks</p>
