<p begin="00:00:17.330" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">so that we could tackle issues in</p>

<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">large-scale social change so let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">out with some books more in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">philosophical space so first of all I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">got this one right here in mind where by</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.959" end="00:02:32.500" style="s2">and in psychology and in my areas of</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.459" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">explains how I kind of in a lot of depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.250" end="00:03:26.470" style="s2">a lot of detail the particular workings</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:28.060" style="s2">of the brain and now those workings of</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.819" end="00:03:49.629" style="s2">share with you three books written by</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:52.409" style="s2">another neuroscientist named Antonio</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.629" end="00:03:55.389" style="s2">Damasio so the first one day cards error</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.409" end="00:03:57.099" style="s2">is kind of a classic now in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.389" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">cognitive sciences it&#39;s published in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.099" end="00:04:02.609" style="s2">early 90s and this book explains in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:05.169" style="s2">through a lot of case studies of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.609" end="00:04:10.269" style="s2">experiencing degenerative brain disease</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.169" end="00:04:12.129" style="s2">and head trauma it shows how how</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.269" end="00:04:15.159" style="s2">reasoning requires the working of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.129" end="00:04:17.169" style="s2">emotion and it&#39;s really a wonderful book</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.159" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">and is widely cited one that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.169" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">known but i think is possibly even more</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">significant as the second book in his</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:27.540" style="s2">series the feeling of what happens this</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">book gives the first fully neurological</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.540" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">account of how consciousness can arise</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:34.170" style="s2">in the workings of the brain and so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in understanding how</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.170" end="00:04:39.480" style="s2">the mind can come from the way the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">works this is a must-read now it is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.480" end="00:04:42.870" style="s2">bit dense at times and it deals with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:45.780" style="s2">lot of neuroscience so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.870" end="00:04:47.850" style="s2">grapple with that but if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.780" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">understand how consciousness works in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.850" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">scientifically rigorous way this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">probably the best entry point you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:56.850" style="s2">going to find and then he capped off his</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:59.490" style="s2">series Damacio did with this book here</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.850" end="00:05:01.290" style="s2">looking for Spinoza joy sorrow in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.490" end="00:05:03.660" style="s2">feeling brain this is much more of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.290" end="00:05:06.660" style="s2">philosophical book so the great thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.660" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">about Antonio is that he&#39;s a one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.660" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">those various philosophically astute</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">scientists so he knows philosophy as</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:15.080" style="s2">well as you know science and what he</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">does in this book is he goes back into</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.080" end="00:05:19.800" style="s2">the era of later enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:21.270" style="s2">philosophy and looks at the work of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.800" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">Spinoza and was a lesser known</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.270" end="00:05:26.340" style="s2">philosopher and shows that Spinoza was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:28.710" style="s2">basically right about the minded human</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.340" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">nature and the origins of morality but</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.710" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">his work was largely overlooked because</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:34.710" style="s2">neuroscience wasn&#39;t advanced enough and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:37.140" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until the late 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.710" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">the neuroscience came what was able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.140" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">catch up with his thinking now another</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:44.100" style="s2">philosopher who you may have heard of if</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:05:46.350" style="s2">you follow the work of George leg off it</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.350" end="00:05:50.610" style="s2">named Mark Johnson so here&#39;s a book</p>

<p begin="00:05:55.980" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">fun read and it&#39;s very insightful about</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.850" end="00:06:05.190" style="s2">how human creativity works and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">able to blend concepts and create new</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:14.430" style="s2">grounded structures of thought like</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.430" end="00:06:19.169" style="s2">to the conceptual domain and then he</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.770" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">elaborates from those basic sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.169" end="00:06:25.740" style="s2">things to a full explanation of how</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.389" end="00:06:47.310" style="s2">understanding and this book is just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:48.900" style="s2">real pleasure to read if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.310" end="00:06:51.659" style="s2">interested in the implications of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.900" end="00:06:56.189" style="s2">cognitive science for the study of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.659" end="00:06:59.789" style="s2">culture the arts music ethics then this</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.189" end="00:07:02.069" style="s2">is your book it&#39;s very readable and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.789" end="00:07:04.949" style="s2">one of the things he does is he explains</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.069" end="00:07:07.229" style="s2">how music theory is related to the part</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.949" end="00:07:09.810" style="s2">of the brain that what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.229" end="00:07:12.389" style="s2">sensorimotor cortex that explains how</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.810" end="00:07:14.099" style="s2">our ability to simulate motion like see</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.389" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">a coordinated activity of the hand or</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.099" end="00:07:21.479" style="s2">the leg is actually activated and used</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:24.029" style="s2">in the experience of melody and tempo</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.479" end="00:07:26.129" style="s2">and music so this is a really cool book</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.029" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">to look at the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.129" end="00:07:32.819" style="s2">arts and science through a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:37.039" style="s2">embodied cognitive science more</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.819" end="00:07:39.090" style="s2">generally this idea of embodiment is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.039" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">something that&#39;s come about in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.090" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">different fields and I&#39;m really pleased</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.810" style="s2">that Raymond Gibbs who&#39;s a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:48.419" style="s2">psychologist put together this book</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.810" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">embodiment in cognitive science now this</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.419" end="00:07:53.250" style="s2">is definitely more of a researchers book</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">than a laypersons book because what ray</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.250" end="00:07:57.960" style="s2">does in this book is he goes through and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:08:00.229" style="s2">systematically gathers up all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.960" end="00:08:03.839" style="s2">peer-reviewed research of different</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:29.310" style="s2">look at how the brain has this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.029" end="00:08:30.810" style="s2">ghost LEM effect and there&#39;s a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:52.850" style="s2">a fantastic resource now if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.620" end="00:08:54.740" style="s2">think more about embodiment at a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.850" end="00:08:56.779" style="s2">philosophical level this is another one</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.740" end="00:08:59.149" style="s2">of those bounding texts it&#39;s widely</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.779" end="00:09:02.149" style="s2">cited now the embodiment in its by</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.540" end="00:09:13.339" style="s2">really beautiful is they critique faulty</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.870" end="00:09:16.040" style="s2">philosophies of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.339" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">through the lens of Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.040" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">contemplative practice which might sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:22.490" style="s2">like that&#39;s a non sequitur like it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:25.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really fit but as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.490" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">the introspective approach of presence</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.610" end="00:09:29.329" style="s2">of being aware of how the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:31.790" style="s2">working in the body that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.329" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">mindfulness meditation gives us insights</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.790" end="00:09:36.680" style="s2">into how we&#39;ve developed a flawed notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:39.379" style="s2">of separation between mind and body and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:42.439" style="s2">what are actually false notions of self</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.379" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">and so Buddhist contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.439" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">has come upon insights that modern or</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:50.300" style="s2">contemporary psychology and neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:52.339" style="s2">are now validating and this book is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.300" end="00:09:55.459" style="s2">great entry point into the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.339" end="00:09:58.519" style="s2">embodied mind and it&#39;s now widely cited</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.459" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">for that purpose now another one that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.519" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">you know I said that there&#39;s George Lake</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.220" end="00:10:05.449" style="s2">off him you know from his work in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:07.009" style="s2">politics you may not know that he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.449" end="00:10:10.009" style="s2">a book with Rafael Nunez called where</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.009" end="00:10:13.490" style="s2">mathematics comes from in this book I it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.009" end="00:10:15.559" style="s2">lays out how the the concepts used in</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.490" end="00:10:18.649" style="s2">mathematics are actually grounded in our</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.559" end="00:10:21.019" style="s2">physical neurological and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.649" end="00:10:22.639" style="s2">being so the way that our brains process</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.019" end="00:10:24.199" style="s2">information and the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.639" end="00:10:25.910" style="s2">cultivate knowledge through our</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.199" end="00:10:29.000" style="s2">experience is also how we learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.910" end="00:10:30.410" style="s2">mathematics and so this book offers the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.000" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">beginnings of a philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.410" end="00:10:34.819" style="s2">mathematics to show that something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:37.819" style="s2">seemingly so abstract is also grounded</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.819" end="00:10:39.740" style="s2">in the bodily experience of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.819" end="00:10:42.319" style="s2">probably the most important work that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.740" end="00:10:44.290" style="s2">George Lake office has created and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.319" end="00:10:46.970" style="s2">wrote it with Mark Johnson is this book</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.290" end="00:10:48.829" style="s2">philosophy in the flesh the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.970" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">mind in its challenge to Western thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.829" end="00:10:53.839" style="s2">now it took them seven years to write</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.759" style="s2">this book and you can see it&#39;s thick</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.839" end="00:10:57.590" style="s2">right this is a big one this is the tome</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.759" end="00:11:00.410" style="s2">you could maybe even think of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.590" end="00:11:03.170" style="s2">as george leigh coughs magnum opus mrs.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.410" end="00:11:06.260" style="s2">has his primary or most important</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.170" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">accomplishment in this book what George</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.260" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">and Mark do is they systematically go</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.990" end="00:11:14.960" style="s2">through the major tenets of Western</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">philosophy and re craft them based on</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.960" end="00:11:19.520" style="s2">what we now know about cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:22.570" style="s2">so they take 2,500 years of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.520" end="00:11:25.580" style="s2">and they recast it with what we now know</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.570" end="00:11:27.110" style="s2">from science this is a major</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.580" end="00:11:28.370" style="s2">accomplishment this is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.110" end="00:11:30.350" style="s2">books that I think is going to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.370" end="00:11:34.100" style="s2">ripples across the scholarly community</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.350" end="00:11:36.530" style="s2">for decades and it&#39;s still not widely</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.100" end="00:11:38.330" style="s2">read enough I mean in a few circles it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.530" end="00:11:40.190" style="s2">well known but for the most part people</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.330" end="00:11:41.810" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard of this book they&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.190" end="00:11:44.780" style="s2">more familiar with George&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.810" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">works speaking of which if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.780" end="00:11:48.710" style="s2">bring out George&#39;s works is most popular</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">one of course is this one don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.710" end="00:11:52.550" style="s2">an elephant this is a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.770" style="s2">essays that apply cognitive science and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.550" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">specifically framing and metaphor to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.770" end="00:11:59.450" style="s2">political discourse and you&#39;ve probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">heard of that one what you may or may</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.450" end="00:12:03.980" style="s2">not know is that that book was actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:06.380" style="s2">inspired or it&#39;s kind of a condensing of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.980" end="00:12:08.510" style="s2">a much larger book moral politics how</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.380" end="00:12:11.150" style="s2">liberals and conservatives think which</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.510" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">he originally published in 1996 and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.150" end="00:12:17.660" style="s2">a second edition came out in 2002 this</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:20.630" style="s2">is the book that explains how the nation</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.660" end="00:12:23.420" style="s2">is family metaphor Maps systematically</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.630" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">onto moral world views that are very</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.420" end="00:12:27.020" style="s2">different for program for liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:29.420" style="s2">for conservatives so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.020" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">understand political thought this book</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.420" end="00:12:35.960" style="s2">lays it out and what is it it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:40.040" style="s2">than 500 450 pages so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.960" end="00:12:42.470" style="s2">thorough exploration of human conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.040" end="00:12:45.620" style="s2">thought and moral reasoning within the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.470" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">political domain now George came out</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.620" end="00:12:53.000" style="s2">later with another book the political</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.310" end="00:12:54.890" style="s2">mind this book does a lot more of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.000" end="00:12:57.290" style="s2">of overview and synthesis of how</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.890" end="00:12:58.850" style="s2">cognitive science maps onto political</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.290" end="00:13:00.260" style="s2">thought and behavior so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.850" end="00:13:02.540" style="s2">interested in political thought and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.260" end="00:13:06.590" style="s2">behavior this is a very important book</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.540" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">and kind of a partner to it written by</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.590" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">another researcher drew westen is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:13.420" style="s2">book the political brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:15.890" style="s2">now see drew westen is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.420" end="00:13:19.130" style="s2">neuropsychologist so he&#39;s a psychologist</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:10.190" style="s2">books now George also kind of following</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.850" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">that book I mentioned earlier women find</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.150" end="00:14:23.060" style="s2">idea and this book looks at how the</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.890" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">a kind of academic endeavor but it turns</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.260" end="00:14:35.750" style="s2">out that freedom is a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:37.820" style="s2">contested concept which means that the</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.820" end="00:14:42.520" style="s2">you bring to it shape what it means to</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.980" end="00:15:00.170" style="s2">thinking now this book here what word</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.030" end="00:15:02.020" style="s2">well didn&#39;t know this is actually a</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.460" end="00:15:09.740" style="s2">politics so this book was written on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.220" end="00:15:13.730" style="s2">anniversary it was the 50th anniversary</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.740" end="00:15:15.740" style="s2">of the publication of an essay that</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.750" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">asked to set a large number of thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.690" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">to reflect on what Orwell got right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.830" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned since then this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">not the one of those practical books for</p>

<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:39.980" style="s2">moving a little bit into another space</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.390" end="00:16:50.149" style="s2">or we could think about cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.950" end="00:17:02.300" style="s2">religion and morality so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.339" style="s2">great book the spell of the sensuous by</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.300" end="00:17:06.530" style="s2">David Abram this is more of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.339" end="00:17:09.920" style="s2">philosophical book but what he does in</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.530" end="00:17:11.900" style="s2">this book is he explores how our moral</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.920" end="00:17:15.069" style="s2">sensibility in the modern world has</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.900" end="00:17:17.390" style="s2">become separated from nature and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.069" end="00:17:19.850" style="s2">cognitive psychologist as well as</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.390" end="00:17:22.329" style="s2">cultural anthropologist so he studies</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.850" end="00:17:25.550" style="s2">indigenous tribal cultures to show how</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.329" end="00:17:29.230" style="s2">the the evolution of language in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.550" end="00:17:32.360" style="s2">different cultures led to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.230" end="00:17:34.460" style="s2">we ended up having what are called</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.360" end="00:17:37.640" style="s2">written phonetic languages and those</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.460" end="00:17:39.350" style="s2">languages have characters that represent</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.640" end="00:17:41.450" style="s2">sounds in the mouth rather than things</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.350" end="00:17:43.700" style="s2">that are in nature and that created an</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.700" end="00:17:48.770" style="s2">thought from nature so this book gives</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:51.830" style="s2">us a sense of the origins of mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.770" end="00:17:53.930" style="s2">dualism how it comes about through a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.830" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">of structuring language and now that</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.930" end="00:17:59.470" style="s2">plays out in morality and our</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:02.360" style="s2">sensibilities about the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.470" end="00:18:04.520" style="s2">now another one another one of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.360" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">kind of key books to interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.520" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">applications of cognitive science to</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:11.570" style="s2">religion is this one religion explained</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.880" style="s2">by Pascal boy yay you see the title of</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.880" end="00:18:18.260" style="s2">of religious thought so Pascal boy a</p>

<p begin="00:18:29.630" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">religion works anthropologically this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:39.380" style="s2">a great book for you kind of a partner</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.150" end="00:18:52.040" style="s2">theory of religious transmission this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.309" end="00:18:55.130" style="s2">more of a technical dive into Pascal</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.040" end="00:18:58.309" style="s2">boys theory of how concepts or conveyed</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.130" end="00:19:00.170" style="s2">across generations so you could think if</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:04.790" style="s2">meme is spread across society this book</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.840" end="00:19:07.309" style="s2">looks at the cognitive psychology of</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.170" end="00:19:16.040" style="s2">cognitive science now there are two</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">books here one of them is the moral mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.040" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">by mark Hauser that there was a moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:23.210" style="s2">animal by Robert right these are both</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">more what would be called evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.210" end="00:19:26.809" style="s2">psychology books and actually I when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:28.850" style="s2">read them I found there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.809" end="00:19:30.500" style="s2">problems with them philosophically you</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.850" end="00:19:32.929" style="s2">could address and that large pile of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.500" end="00:19:35.300" style="s2">books I shared with you on on philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.929" end="00:19:38.690" style="s2">but they&#39;re still really good at helping</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.300" end="00:19:41.660" style="s2">you understand how evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.690" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">can inform the way we understand human</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.660" end="00:19:45.159" style="s2">nature and morality</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:47.289" style="s2">in that same vein here&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.159" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">books it has more of a light title but</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.289" end="00:19:51.460" style="s2">is actually very very insightful is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:54.429" style="s2">sex is fun the evolution of human</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.460" end="00:19:56.049" style="s2">sexuality by Jared Diamond you might</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.429" end="00:19:58.179" style="s2">know Jared Diamond because of his book</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.730" end="00:20:07.179" style="s2">shorter looks at how we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.529" end="00:20:09.460" style="s2">human sexuality by looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.179" end="00:20:12.100" style="s2">history of hominids meaning I looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.460" end="00:20:13.870" style="s2">primates how are we similar to or</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.100" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">different from bonobos how are we</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.870" end="00:20:18.059" style="s2">similar to our different from gorillas</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">and really bringing a strong</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.059" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">evolutionary biology perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:27.779" style="s2">sexuality and immorality it&#39;s a fun read</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:31.659" style="s2">but it&#39;s also very very insightful now</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.779" end="00:20:34.149" style="s2">while we&#39;re talking about evolution here</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.659" end="00:20:36.429" style="s2">are two books for you that give a much</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.149" end="00:20:38.769" style="s2">deeper context to our human nature works</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.429" end="00:20:42.220" style="s2">so here&#39;s one on deep history in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.769" end="00:20:44.230" style="s2">brain by Daniel Lords mail this book is</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.220" end="00:20:45.730" style="s2">actually written what the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.230" end="00:20:48.250" style="s2">changing the way that people study</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.730" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">history but it&#39;s really a wonderful book</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.250" end="00:20:54.610" style="s2">in that it shows if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:57.279" style="s2">understand human history in our deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.610" end="00:20:59.740" style="s2">origins which means how do we arise from</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.279" end="00:21:01.990" style="s2">evolution how did we come into being</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.740" end="00:21:04.389" style="s2">with the changing planet and that deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.990" end="00:21:06.669" style="s2">historic sensibility then we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.389" end="00:21:10.360" style="s2">understand how the brain evolved we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.669" end="00:21:13.059" style="s2">to understand how the the core kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.360" end="00:21:16.779" style="s2">hind brain or the brainstem part of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.059" end="00:21:18.970" style="s2">brain is related to reptiles for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.779" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">and now the evolution of reptiles shaped</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.970" end="00:21:22.779" style="s2">the way that they behave that also</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:24.340" style="s2">partly shapes how we behave so this book</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.779" end="00:21:27.510" style="s2">is really good at giving you a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.340" end="00:21:30.100" style="s2">what deep history is and how to apply</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.510" end="00:21:32.200" style="s2">evolutionary biology especially with</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.100" end="00:21:36.340" style="s2">respect to the changing brain over time</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.200" end="00:21:38.380" style="s2">to understand our deep origins now</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.340" end="00:21:40.659" style="s2">another book this one&#39;s highly technical</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.380" end="00:21:43.139" style="s2">very dense this is not for the light of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.659" end="00:21:47.320" style="s2">heart but it&#39;s a fantastic book is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.139" end="00:21:49.659" style="s2">incomplete nature by Terrence Deacon now</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.320" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">what Terry does in this book is on he</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.659" end="00:21:54.570" style="s2">takes as expertise which is easing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">anthropologist and he studies the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.570" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">evolutionary develop</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:21:59.920" style="s2">of the human brain and how it came into</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">being and so what he does in this book</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.920" end="00:22:09.550" style="s2">is just phenomenal is he very rigorously</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:13.030" style="s2">shows how dynamic patterns can form to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.550" end="00:22:14.650" style="s2">create goal-directed behavior so we know</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.030" end="00:22:16.690" style="s2">that all biological organisms are</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.650" end="00:22:19.180" style="s2">goal-directed they try to survive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.690" end="00:22:21.730" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to reproduce and humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.180" end="00:22:24.310" style="s2">have this really amazing ability to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.730" end="00:22:26.790" style="s2">consciously set goals for ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.310" end="00:22:29.500" style="s2">be purposeful and so in this book he</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.790" end="00:22:31.870" style="s2">explains how those dynamic patterns</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.500" end="00:22:35.830" style="s2">emerge this is a book that looks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.870" end="00:22:38.350" style="s2">of complexity and how complexity emerges</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.830" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">in natural systems to explain how the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.350" end="00:22:43.780" style="s2">mind can emerge in a natural system that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:46.450" style="s2">is the human organism as it evolves so</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.780" end="00:22:48.220" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very good book but like I said</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.450" end="00:22:50.950" style="s2">not for the faint of heart it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.220" end="00:22:53.080" style="s2">definitely more of a scholarly work now</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.950" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">in a similar vein of applying complexity</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.080" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">to a human nature in the mind here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.160" style="s2">that&#39;s really a lovely book out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:02.230" style="s2">control by Kevin Kelly you see the new</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.160" end="00:23:04.510" style="s2">biology of machines social systems in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.230" end="00:23:06.970" style="s2">the economic world Kevin Kelly is the</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.970" end="00:23:12.160" style="s2">was one of the major inspirations for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.670" end="00:23:14.160" style="s2">the matrix movies in the 90s and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.160" end="00:23:17.470" style="s2">Kevin Kelly does in his book is he</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.160" end="00:23:19.510" style="s2">challenges the notion that machine</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.470" end="00:23:21.850" style="s2">intelligence artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.510" end="00:23:24.070" style="s2">will be different from human</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.850" end="00:23:25.630" style="s2">intelligence by saying that the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.070" end="00:23:27.910" style="s2">we will develop artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.630" end="00:23:29.890" style="s2">is through biomimicry as we better</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.910" end="00:23:32.200" style="s2">understand how biological systems work</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.890" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">like say the way that an ant navigates</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.200" end="00:23:37.000" style="s2">through a space then we improve robotics</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:39.370" style="s2">we improve machine learning and what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.000" end="00:23:41.320" style="s2">end up with is this place where you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.370" end="00:23:44.050" style="s2">no longer separate machine from</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.320" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">biological organism an example of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.050" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">in today&#39;s context would be twitter</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:50.530" style="s2">twitter is a technology it&#39;s a machine</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:52.600" style="s2">like a robot but it works by connecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.530" end="00:23:56.170" style="s2">lots of humans into a large collective</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.600" end="00:23:59.230" style="s2">intelligence and the the processing of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.170" end="00:24:01.210" style="s2">Twitter requires human activity as much</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.230" end="00:24:03.070" style="s2">as the machine piece of it and really</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.210" end="00:24:05.860" style="s2">you can&#39;t separate the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.070" end="00:24:07.870" style="s2">Twitter into human and machine they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.860" end="00:24:09.410" style="s2">completely blended so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.870" end="00:24:11.330" style="s2">philosophical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.410" end="00:24:13.040" style="s2">was developed by Kevin Kelly in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.330" end="00:24:15.950" style="s2">book and it&#39;s it&#39;s a really good read</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.040" end="00:24:18.860" style="s2">for understanding kind of delving into</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.950" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">how complexity and biomimicry shape our</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.860" end="00:24:25.400" style="s2">understandings of the mind now getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:27.650" style="s2">into a little bit different space let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.400" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">talk for a moment about how cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:53.000" style="s2">inform the way that we design ideas so</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.810" end="00:24:54.530" style="s2">that they can spread more easily so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.000" end="00:24:57.140" style="s2">think about the Occupy movement last</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.530" end="00:25:00.110" style="s2">year and how readily the Occupy frame in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.140" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">the 99 percent frame spread all around</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.110" end="00:25:05.720" style="s2">the world they spread like a virus and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:08.060" style="s2">so they could be understood in the way</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.050" end="00:34:46.300" style="s2">describes how modern understandings of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:47.860" style="s2">cognitive science are shaping the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.300" end="00:34:51.129" style="s2">that we understand the history of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.860" end="00:34:54.129" style="s2">civilization specifically though what</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.129" end="00:34:56.409" style="s2">Rifkin explores in this book is how as</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.129" end="00:34:58.210" style="s2">societies become more sophisticated with</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.409" end="00:35:01.060" style="s2">time they become more complex as they</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.210" end="00:35:02.860" style="s2">grow how they increase the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.060" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">empathy for the people in those</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.860" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2">societies and so he lays out for us a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:11.320" style="s2">choice point a place where we can go one</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.250" end="00:35:13.870" style="s2">way or the other we&#39;re either we lead</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.320" end="00:35:16.180" style="s2">ourselves to global economic and</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.180" end="00:35:20.920" style="s2">destroyer</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.850" end="00:35:23.810" style="s2">or we develop a capacity for empathy</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.920" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">embedded in our civilization that allows</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.810" end="00:35:28.670" style="s2">us to save ourselves and move to a new</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:31.580" style="s2">level of cultural evolution and this</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.820" end="00:35:44.750" style="s2">that so it&#39;s kind of like a culminating</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.430" end="00:35:46.130" style="s2">point if you want to bring a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.750" end="00:35:48.230" style="s2">understandings of cognitive science</p>

<p begin="00:35:48.230" end="00:35:54.080" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.580" end="00:35:56.510" style="s2">this is a great book so you know i just</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.170" end="00:36:04.730" style="s2">three of these books and find them very</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:06.590" style="s2">useful but I found it in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.730" end="00:36:09.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve approached my understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.590" end="00:36:11.390" style="s2">cognitive science that I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.230" end="00:36:13.550" style="s2">rounded in a particular discipline I</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.390" end="00:36:16.280" style="s2">haven&#39;t been as like a guest or linguist</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.550" end="00:36:17.750" style="s2">you know or some specific field and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.280" end="00:36:20.270" style="s2">can see from the sampling of books I</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.750" end="00:36:22.430" style="s2">shared here that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.270" end="00:36:24.890" style="s2">convergence of understanding across many</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.430" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">different fields of research and for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.890" end="00:36:30.140" style="s2">first time ever we really are grappling</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:32.510" style="s2">with a legitimate understanding of human</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.140" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">nature in the mind and now the question</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.510" end="00:36:38.680" style="s2">is what do we do with it now my focus</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:41.780" style="s2">the thing that I&#39;m most interested in is</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.680" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">helping to design the transition process</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.780" end="00:36:47.090" style="s2">how do human beings create the change in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:49.100" style="s2">the world to move us toward a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.090" end="00:36:52.250" style="s2">sustainable and just global civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.100" end="00:36:54.260" style="s2">and there are lots of ways that that can</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.250" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">work and you can see that in this set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.260" end="00:36:58.100" style="s2">books you can get a sense of my own</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.520" end="00:36:59.660" style="s2">personal journey this is a large</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.100" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">sampling of the books that I&#39;ve read in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.660" end="00:37:04.490" style="s2">cognitive science probably about half of</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:06.200" style="s2">the ones that I&#39;ve read and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.490" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">how it&#39;s informed my thinking by just</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.200" end="00:37:11.990" style="s2">what&#39;s already here now what I&#39;m really</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:26.660" style="s2">of open access to information and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.260" end="00:37:28.670" style="s2">democratization of ideas so I&#39;m just</p>
