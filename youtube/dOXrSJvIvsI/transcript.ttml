<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.049" style="s2">so I wrote up a response that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.340" end="00:00:06.899" style="s2">going to read it just because you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.049" end="00:00:08.580" style="s2">read it it&#39;s on my website but I will</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.899" end="00:00:11.160" style="s2">just kind of extrapolate a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.580" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">some of the key points I made there I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.160" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">want to suggest that I take two stances</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">here the weak argument is that integral</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">should at least become more informed</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:24.930" style="s2">about what capitalism is and that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">have actually a completely kind of under</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.930" end="00:00:30.060" style="s2">interrogated under theorized conception</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">of capitalism and the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">capitalism that we talked about integral</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">capitalism yada yada it mostly ignores</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:38.760" style="s2">the entire tradition of heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">economics and so I think once we have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.760" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">more comprehensive view of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">the capitalist economy then I get to my</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">stronger argument which is that when you</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">understand the dynamics of capitalism it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:52.739" style="s2">becomes clear that if you stick to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">principles of integral theory and of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.739" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">integral meta theories more broadly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">especially people like bats car then we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:01.370" style="s2">should be if we&#39;re committed to our own</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:04.640" style="s2">principles at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.370" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">post-capitalist and potentially actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.640" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">anti-capitalist and so when people say</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">the anti-capitalist movement is a green</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:17.240" style="s2">meme phenomena to me they&#39;re using green</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">meme and two terms like second tier as</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.240" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">substitutions for actual thought right</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.450" style="s2">we need to actually think through what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">going on in these movements and spend</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.450" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">time dialoging with them in their most</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">sophisticated forms and not using</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">developmental theory as a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">essentially to dismiss them and not</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">listen to them so i&#39;m going to say the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">strong argument is the one that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:42.869" style="s2">going to propose a day just because this</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">is a polarized debate so of course to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.869" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">think about how capitalism works more</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">deeply we need to get into a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:49.470" style="s2">complex theories in economics including</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">the nature of money they need to a value</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">theory right I&#39;m not going to get into</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">that today but we can but I think what i</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:57.180" style="s2">want to say here is that the principles</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">of interval theory talk often about</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.180" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">transcending and including but i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a basic confusion in there</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">between enduring and transitional</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:07.160" style="s2">structures all right so that&#39;s one issue</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">here so you can think about transcending</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.160" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">capitalism but negating and preserving</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:17.010" style="s2">it as opposed to transcending button</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">in its entirety so that&#39;s I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:19.500" style="s2">the sticking points here is we think as</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:21.210" style="s2">developmentalist we need to always</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.500" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">transcendent include and to be integral</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.210" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">you can&#39;t be anti anything but in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">to be integral your auntie a lot and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:30.420" style="s2">need to admit that you know I&#39;m anti</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">injustice right I don&#39;t transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.420" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">include injustice I get rid of injustice</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:36.860" style="s2">right so the idea that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:39.660" style="s2">inclusiveness that includes everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.860" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">becomes a problem and so I love integral</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.660" end="00:02:42.750" style="s2">theory because of the inclusiveness but</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">we need to become more articulate about</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.750" end="00:02:47.850" style="s2">what it means to be opposed to things</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:50.580" style="s2">and to speak you know and to take power</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.850" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">and to use force occasionally when</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.580" end="00:02:55.980" style="s2">necessary to be opposed to things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:02:59.850" style="s2">not to find ways to rationalize and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.980" end="00:03:03.000" style="s2">justify them right so I think there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.850" end="00:03:05.070" style="s2">underlying issue here about strategy</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.000" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">versus compromise right and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.070" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">going to get into that but hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a chance to get into that but</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:10.860" style="s2">it&#39;s key to think about here the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">conscious capitalism movement and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.860" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">that means and the degree to which that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">is a compromise or strategy right so to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">preempt my kind of Integrative comments</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:22.830" style="s2">I would say something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:25.549" style="s2">conscious capitalism should be seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.830" end="00:03:27.900" style="s2">gateway drug to an actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.549" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">post-capitalist form of intoxication</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.900" end="00:03:38.250" style="s2">social intoxication so to that extent</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">i&#39;m not opposed to conscious capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.250" end="00:03:42.810" style="s2">but i am opposed to a form of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:46.019" style="s2">capitalism that sees no alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.810" end="00:03:47.670" style="s2">capitalism right and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.019" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">they I&#39;m gonna use that term</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.670" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">occasionally the man that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">want you to think that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:03:58.650" style="s2">alternative that somehow capitalism act</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.430" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">is actually a naturally occurring thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.650" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">that markets are like nag nature and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:04.110" style="s2">watch David Attenborough and David</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">Attenborough says in the BBC nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.110" end="00:04:08.760" style="s2">programs that the flower is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.530" style="s2">entrepreneurial and exploits the be to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.760" end="00:04:12.360" style="s2">have it and what you see is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.530" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">actually so ingrained in our ideology</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.360" end="00:04:17.760" style="s2">that we read backwards into nature and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:18.989" style="s2">posit the social system we saw and when</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">Darwin came with the theory of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.989" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">it was Charlie Sanders pursue said this</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:25.349" style="s2">is nothing but the gospel of greed right</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">so we naturalize capitalism and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.349" end="00:04:29.740" style="s2">see be</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:29.740" style="s2">did and it&#39;s a failure of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.699" end="00:04:35.570" style="s2">there&#39;s also worth saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:37.010" style="s2">capitalism is by its nature and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.570" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">using this term and I haven&#39;t to find it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.010" end="00:04:40.820" style="s2">but one of the things that defines it by</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">my definition is that it cannot imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.820" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">its own eternity which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:47.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a form of social organization that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:49.220" style="s2">runs up against limits inevitably the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.540" end="00:04:51.560" style="s2">greatest example is the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.220" end="00:04:53.510" style="s2">endless profit especially compounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.560" end="00:04:55.790" style="s2">rates of profit and if you know anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.510" end="00:04:58.090" style="s2">about compounding rates of growth they</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.790" end="00:05:01.669" style="s2">are radically unsustainable on a limited</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.090" end="00:05:03.139" style="s2">playing field right and so as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.669" end="00:05:04.760" style="s2">you say well capitalism isn&#39;t about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.139" end="00:05:05.570" style="s2">endless pursuit of profit that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.760" end="00:05:07.729" style="s2">saying you&#39;re talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.570" end="00:05:09.650" style="s2">else and not capitalism right now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.729" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">fine we can have that debate but the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.650" end="00:05:13.370" style="s2">catalyst is structured and what it means</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:14.600" style="s2">to cater to corporate interests is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.370" end="00:05:16.850" style="s2">help those corporations turn a profit</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.600" end="00:05:19.130" style="s2">and then you get into value theory and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.850" end="00:05:21.020" style="s2">you think where does excess money come</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.130" end="00:05:23.139" style="s2">from where does surplus value come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.020" end="00:05:25.729" style="s2">it comes from the exploitation of labor</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.139" end="00:05:28.039" style="s2">primarily and we can debate that but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.729" end="00:05:30.260" style="s2">will stick pretty closely to that so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.039" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">reason we don&#39;t have robot robot</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.260" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">factories because you don&#39;t make money</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:35.539" style="s2">through technological innovation in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:37.460" style="s2">long run because everyone can build that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.539" end="00:05:39.860" style="s2">you make money by having access to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.460" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">exploitable labor and this is the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.860" end="00:05:47.419" style="s2">reason that we have corporations of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:49.729" style="s2">global scope that can push nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.419" end="00:05:51.289" style="s2">around and it&#39;s primarily so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.729" end="00:05:53.210" style="s2">find ways to exploit labor but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.289" end="00:05:55.340" style="s2">only so long that there are peasant</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.210" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">populations that can be brought into the</p>
