<p begin="00:00:01.700" end="00:00:07.649" style="s2">technology is powerful it&#39;s also risky</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:10.440" style="s2">when we create it together it is less</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.649" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">risky and more powerful so in this video</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.440" end="00:00:15.780" style="s2">we are going to cover the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">can do with technology together that no</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.780" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">single technology company designed for</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:26.039" style="s2">profit and owned by a tiny few can even</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">hope to accomplish you can imagine if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.039" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">owned facebook together how powerful</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">that would be that we could improve it</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">we could make sure we we trust the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">information we would put the systems in</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:38.750" style="s2">place to make sure we&#39;re fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:41.270" style="s2">in a way that doesn&#39;t stifle free speech</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.750" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;re keeping people safe</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.270" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">now we don&#39;t own Facebook nor are we</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">going to own Facebook we can recreate</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">something very facebook like and own it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:58.109" style="s2">together even if we just had facebook</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">that would be amazing but there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:02.010" style="s2">things that we can do together when we</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:04.769" style="s2">own it together and design it together</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.010" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">that they will never be able to do and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.769" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">therefore we out-compete them hands-down</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">they have to convince us that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">working more in our Benner benefit than</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">in our disadvantage right that they they</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">give us more than they cost us and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">starting to show they&#39;re costing us a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">lot they&#39;re selling our data they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:31.590" style="s2">costing us elections they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">things that are the outcome of seeking</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.590" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">profit and the outcome of just not</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">knowing what to do about it not being</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">able to be transparent about it when we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:46.560" style="s2">create something together we empower our</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">members to help us improve it tell us</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.560" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">what you don&#39;t trust so we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">more trustworthy tell us what doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">make sense in the transparency of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">information so we can make it make</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">better sense to you tell us what</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">using this technology more or is it</p>
