<p begin="00:00:44.049" end="00:00:49.000" style="s2">this episode basically came from a phone</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.199" end="00:00:51.040" style="s2">call or conversation of some sort we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:53.739" style="s2">a few weeks ago and I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.040" end="00:00:56.019" style="s2">proclaiming and my usual in modest</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.739" end="00:00:58.510" style="s2">matter that this was not the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.019" end="00:01:00.460" style="s2">revolutionary moment that the kovat this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.510" end="00:01:03.909" style="s2">was and this was Cove in nineteen prior</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">to the George Floyd event and I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.909" end="00:01:08.860" style="s2">this is not the revolutionary moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:10.810" style="s2">Merritt and Michael said I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.860" end="00:01:12.759" style="s2">wrong I think this is the revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.810" end="00:01:16.390" style="s2">moment but this is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.759" end="00:01:19.270" style="s2">passive-aggressive revolutionary moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.390" end="00:01:22.440" style="s2">and I said to him say no more Michael</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.270" end="00:01:26.710" style="s2">this will make a great podcast episode</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.440" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">so you know things have happened since</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.710" end="00:01:30.840" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:33.520" style="s2">so first what did you mean when you said</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.840" end="00:01:35.640" style="s2">passive aggressive revolutionary moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.520" end="00:01:39.640" style="s2">and what do you think that all means now</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.640" end="00:01:43.600" style="s2">so let&#39;s imagine that there was a moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.640" end="00:01:45.010" style="s2">of Prayer across the country in across</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.600" end="00:01:46.600" style="s2">the waters range of religious</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.600" end="00:01:49.570" style="s2">to get the Mormons in for this but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.070" end="00:01:51.850" style="s2">think practically everyone else could</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.570" end="00:01:55.510" style="s2">potentially be enlisted at least for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.850" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">few centerpiece of churches or any other</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.510" end="00:02:03.070" style="s2">sort of religious affiliation now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:05.590" style="s2">say there was a some sort of attack by</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.070" end="00:02:07.510" style="s2">American soldiers or police against</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.590" end="00:02:09.849" style="s2">protesters who were behaving fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.510" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">peacefully there was fairly good video</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.849" end="00:02:14.590" style="s2">evidence of this and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:16.780" style="s2">nationwide movement of prayer for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.590" end="00:02:19.900" style="s2">defeat of the American military by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.780" end="00:02:21.370" style="s2">American people that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.900" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">great example of a passive aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.370" end="00:02:27.310" style="s2">military revolutionary moment we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:29.049" style="s2">good enough communication now in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.310" end="00:02:31.780" style="s2">that is never existed before during the</p>

<p begin="00:06:47.100" end="00:06:52.020" style="s2">I think I think you&#39;ve convinced me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.080" end="00:06:57.050" style="s2">this could that the tactics of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.020" end="00:07:01.080" style="s2">passive-aggressive could be used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.050" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">instantiate a revolution any sign to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.080" end="00:07:05.310" style="s2">your mind that we&#39;re actually seeing</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:07.260" style="s2">that manifesting now I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.310" end="00:07:10.230" style="s2">more my point that a few weeks ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.260" end="00:07:14.220" style="s2">before the George Floyd situation I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.230" end="00:07:16.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t seeing this as the predicate yet</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.220" end="00:07:19.890" style="s2">for a revolution whether passive</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.680" end="00:07:21.390" style="s2">aggressive or aggressive but I would I</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.890" end="00:07:24.060" style="s2">would buy that a passive aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.390" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">revolution is possible is this a moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.060" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">where we are seeing it you know of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:29.430" style="s2">course what we&#39;re seeing in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:31.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t really passive aggressive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.430" end="00:07:33.660" style="s2">more good old-fashioned aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.230" end="00:07:39.300" style="s2">aggressive so talk about that little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.660" end="00:07:41.640" style="s2">if you would but it seems like there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.300" end="00:07:43.740" style="s2">so many photographers and force flags is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.640" end="00:07:45.570" style="s2">kind of meaningless with the current</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.740" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">information infrastructure treatment</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.570" end="00:07:51.570" style="s2">trying to decide who is starting things</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:54.420" style="s2">at any given an incident but we pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.570" end="00:07:56.760" style="s2">much know that in a very important sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.420" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">George Floyd did not start things by</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.760" end="00:08:03.180" style="s2">passing along a potentially counterfeit</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:05.010" style="s2">$20 bill that&#39;s like a natural starting</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.180" end="00:08:07.740" style="s2">point because they took until I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.010" end="00:08:10.590" style="s2">today or yesterday for the police who</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.740" end="00:08:13.640" style="s2">stood by while he was murdered to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.590" end="00:08:16.680" style="s2">arrested and if it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.640" end="00:08:19.500" style="s2">empirically known that a fairly high</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.680" end="00:08:21.420" style="s2">level of social disruption environments</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.500" end="00:08:23.760" style="s2">is required together that sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.420" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">arrest to happen then it&#39;s federally</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.760" end="00:08:27.749" style="s2">generally known that there was some sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">of a force that is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.749" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">violence here some sort of more than</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:39.089" style="s2">local property tours breaking the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:42.579" style="s2">windows of other auto shops we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.089" end="00:08:46.750" style="s2">provocative police forces that have</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.579" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">given up any plausible claim to serving</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.750" end="00:08:50.740" style="s2">and protecting the people and we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:52.690" style="s2">this not just in Minneapolis because</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.740" end="00:08:54.699" style="s2">otherwise other police forces would have</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.690" end="00:08:56.649" style="s2">made efforts to distance themselves we</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.699" end="00:08:58.329" style="s2">have to conclude that we have this all</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.649" end="00:09:00.790" style="s2">throughout the country not meaning every</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.329" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">police force but when people say they</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.790" end="00:09:05.529" style="s2">don&#39;t you know a few bad cops doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:07.810" style="s2">mean there are no good cops yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.529" end="00:09:10.720" style="s2">there&#39;s other bound to how good you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.810" end="00:09:12.519" style="s2">be and not be a whistleblower in any</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.720" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">given organization and this depends</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.519" end="00:09:17.110" style="s2">somewhat on what your situation is with</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:19.630" style="s2">dependence but I think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.110" end="00:09:21.670" style="s2">that like when you released the Pentagon</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.630" end="00:09:24.610" style="s2">Papers Daniel Ellsberg established the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">upper bound on how decent person you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.610" end="00:09:30.360" style="s2">could be and be a top-level US military</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:32.860" style="s2">adviser and when chelsea manning</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.360" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">released her videos of americans</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.860" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">murdering iraqis she established an</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.430" style="s2">upper bound on how a decent person you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">could be and even like a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.430" end="00:09:45.250" style="s2">low-level US military officer and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:46.420" style="s2">snowden established a decent upper bound</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.250" end="00:09:48.310" style="s2">for her reason the person who could</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.420" end="00:09:51.899" style="s2">begin to be someone does contracting for</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.310" end="00:09:56.010" style="s2">the US with a high security clearance so</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.899" end="00:09:58.449" style="s2">there&#39;s this progressive decay of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.010" end="00:10:00.370" style="s2">plausible royal motivations one</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.449" end="00:10:05.980" style="s2">contribute to a certain group of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.370" end="00:10:07.980" style="s2">and two so at some point you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.980" end="00:10:10.870" style="s2">regard people as enemy combatants and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.980" end="00:10:12.760" style="s2">therefore not entitled to trial like if</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.870" end="00:10:14.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve established a situation where cops</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.760" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">believe that when people learn to type</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.380" end="00:10:17.529" style="s2">of a file then they&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.120" end="00:10:19.149" style="s2">established a situation where no</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.529" end="00:10:21.459" style="s2">reasonable person predict cops were</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.149" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">entitled to a trial and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.459" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">mean that they it&#39;s anyone&#39;s obligation</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:26.589" style="s2">to fight enemy combatants there&#39;s no I</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">mean that they&#39;re obligated to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.589" end="00:10:30.790" style="s2">there&#39;s no legitimate regime that could</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:33.310" style="s2">possibly command them to and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.790" end="00:10:39.970" style="s2">dangerous and stupid you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.310" end="00:10:41.740" style="s2">it&#39;s if I was a parent right now I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.970" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">be very worried</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.740" end="00:10:45.580" style="s2">if I thought they were involved in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:47.800" style="s2">Birmingham police presence and I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.580" end="00:10:51.160" style="s2">encourage them not to do so but it would</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.800" end="00:10:53.260" style="s2">not be at all motivated by the moral</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.160" end="00:10:54.760" style="s2">sense that it was not virtuous to put</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.260" end="00:10:56.860" style="s2">down police presence I would have no</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.760" end="00:10:59.260" style="s2">qualms that it was virtuous to protect</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.860" end="00:11:00.910" style="s2">police presence and her promise that as</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.260" end="00:11:02.890" style="s2">a parent it&#39;s my job to protect my</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.910" end="00:11:04.660" style="s2">children from getting carried away with</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.890" end="00:11:07.300" style="s2">virtuous but dangerous somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.660" end="00:11:08.740" style="s2">performative behaviors what&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.300" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">interesting perspective my god I must</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.740" end="00:11:15.430" style="s2">say I am up considerably more</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:17.650" style="s2">sympathetic to the police in in part</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.430" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">that&#39;s just personal history I come from</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.650" end="00:11:24.280" style="s2">a police family and my father was</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:26.740" style="s2">Washington DC policeman for his career</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.280" end="00:11:28.360" style="s2">and then had a second career it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.740" end="00:11:30.610" style="s2">federal law enforcement my brother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.360" end="00:11:33.840" style="s2">federal law enforcement on my closest</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:36.460" style="s2">first cousins was local law enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.840" end="00:11:40.180" style="s2">and so I and to my best friends just</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.460" end="00:11:43.060" style="s2">retired after 30 years as police</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.180" end="00:11:45.040" style="s2">officers in Washington DC and I know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.060" end="00:11:48.820" style="s2">lot of cops and I know a lot about cop</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.040" end="00:11:51.910" style="s2">culture and the best for ponderin some</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.820" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">cops are solid decent actually wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.910" end="00:11:56.830" style="s2">people with great willingness to put</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">their own lives on the line for all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.830" end="00:12:03.250" style="s2">us and keep in mind there are 700,000</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:05.950" style="s2">policemen in the United States 700,000</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.250" end="00:12:07.840" style="s2">right if you had 1% bad which would be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.950" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">remarkably low number in any bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.840" end="00:12:13.690" style="s2">I ever worked in that&#39;d be 7,000 bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">cops and it&#39;s probably bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.690" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">and you know with humans dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:19.900" style="s2">life-or-death situations high pressure</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:20.440" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna tell you other little</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.900" end="00:12:22.600" style="s2">secret</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.440" end="00:12:28.270" style="s2">most cops ain&#39;t too bright the average I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.600" end="00:12:32.620" style="s2">Cuba cops 105 little in a little yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.270" end="00:12:33.700" style="s2">yeah not not too good and but it may be</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.620" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">better in school teacher I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.700" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know that number but it&#39;s anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:38.950" style="s2">here we have people of slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">above-average intelligence some of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.950" end="00:12:43.480" style="s2">obviously below average let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:45.520" style="s2">a distribution inevitably some number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.480" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">bad apples get through the screening</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.520" end="00:12:53.070" style="s2">process to my mind to say that one</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:55.390" style="s2">clearly depraved event should signify</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.070" end="00:12:59.470" style="s2">that it&#39;s okay to burn down</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.390" end="00:13:01.960" style="s2">stations strikes me as grossly excessive</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.470" end="00:13:03.610" style="s2">so I want to say two things first of all</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.960" end="00:13:05.950" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s okay to burn dead</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.610" end="00:13:07.690" style="s2">police officers and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.950" end="00:13:09.430" style="s2">okay to bring down police stations I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.690" end="00:13:11.350" style="s2">saying it&#39;s virtuous but stupid to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.430" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">prevent police stations your parents to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.350" end="00:13:16.510" style="s2">drown you you said was morally okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:18.430" style="s2">though and that&#39;s what I would object no</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.510" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">it&#39;s more it&#39;s more of a weekly</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.430" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">imperative but many things are morally</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.290" end="00:13:24.160" style="s2">weekly imperative like not even factory</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:25.930" style="s2">fun to meet you don&#39;t want to blame</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.749" end="00:16:31.669" style="s2">know that it was very significant that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.329" end="00:16:33.649" style="s2">the officers were fired and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.669" end="00:16:36.290" style="s2">was they were no longer protected by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.649" end="00:16:38.209" style="s2">Union and the unions have got these very</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.209" end="00:16:43.610" style="s2">forced all the prosecutors from talking</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.610" end="00:16:50.929" style="s2">alone arresting them and so it was a</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.929" end="00:16:56.209" style="s2">mayor of Minneapolis to fire the police</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">officers so they could be dealt with in</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.230" end="00:17:04.639" style="s2">it strikes me that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.220" end="00:17:07.069" style="s2">misconduct of a criminal sort should not</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.639" end="00:17:10.130" style="s2">be defense against that should not be</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.069" end="00:17:15.019" style="s2">baked into a union contract there&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.549" end="00:17:20.390" style="s2">remember the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.000" end="00:17:23.449" style="s2">that gives police a significant amount</p>

<p begin="00:17:28.669" end="00:17:34.280" style="s2">normal citizen and I think that should</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.789" end="00:17:38.750" style="s2">also be changed by legislation if</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:41.690" style="s2">necessary yes the cops have a tough job</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.750" end="00:17:43.190" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re you know things</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.690" end="00:17:45.080" style="s2">will happen but they should be held to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.190" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">exactly the same same level of</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.380" end="00:18:01.159" style="s2">interesting in Virginia it&#39;s rare very</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.210" end="00:18:04.210" style="s2">few states do this but Virginia allows</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:26.390" style="s2">whether you should have police powers</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.490" end="00:18:33.710" style="s2">interesting idea it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.590" end="00:18:36.590" style="s2">analogous to David Brin&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.710" end="00:18:41.539" style="s2">idea that every government agency should</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.590" end="00:18:43.190" style="s2">have citizen observers who can go to</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.230" end="00:18:53.299" style="s2">whistle they are allowed to blow the</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:18:59.419" style="s2">which is kind of an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.169" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">trade-off which is if you hear something</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.419" end="00:19:05.299" style="s2">sufficiently horrifying that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:06.590" style="s2">willing to spend a year in jail then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.299" end="00:19:09.559" style="s2">can blow the whistle I thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.590" end="00:19:11.830" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting concept on</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.559" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">how to how to police the powers-that-be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.830" end="00:19:16.940" style="s2">so that you don&#39;t have bad faith actors</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:18.710" style="s2">because no one wants to spend a year in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.940" end="00:19:23.980" style="s2">jail but on the other hand if you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.710" end="00:19:25.820" style="s2">about you know consciously plotted</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.710" end="00:19:38.909" style="s2">something like that yeah we were frankly</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.169" end="00:19:40.919" style="s2">even the level of Snowden&#39;s stuff of</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.909" end="00:19:43.890" style="s2">massive illegal surveillance of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.919" end="00:19:45.539" style="s2">citizenry right you know what Snowden</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.539" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">it&#39;s Snowden&#39;s shoulders been willing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.370" end="00:19:52.620" style="s2">spend a year in jail to blow the whistle</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:55.140" style="s2">probably so but unfortunately our laws</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.620" end="00:19:56.580" style="s2">are way too draconian you know Snowden</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.679" end="00:20:02.760" style="s2">back for 30 years to life come back for</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.809" end="00:20:05.429" style="s2">a year in the local lockup yeah why</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.760" end="00:20:07.980" style="s2">not and be a hero when you came out but</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.429" end="00:20:10.590" style="s2">the choice wasn&#39;t both draconian and</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.590" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">mean the progress of the laws our rules</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.630" end="00:20:18.120" style="s2">their norms and put fundamentally no one</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:21.000" style="s2">expects them to be rules but they need</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.000" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">deniability event that that&#39;s in order</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:27.510" style="s2">for the laws not to just be a race one</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:29.909" style="s2">and so when they lose possible</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.510" end="00:20:32.340" style="s2">deniability it actually ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.909" end="00:20:33.690" style="s2">just a race for so hopefully we can have</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.340" end="00:20:36.120" style="s2">peace now that we&#39;ve arrested these</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.289" end="00:20:46.919" style="s2">things but you know having done this</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.929" end="00:20:48.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear that it&#39;s still moral to</p>

<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:56.250" style="s2">arrested that seems like a personal</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.020" end="00:20:58.169" style="s2">chase there can be some disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.250" end="00:20:59.880" style="s2">about that the army is still 11 streets</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.169" end="00:21:01.409" style="s2">police are still shooting journalists in</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:13.350" style="s2">and beating them up as they try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:15.750" style="s2">escape police are still doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.350" end="00:21:18.600" style="s2">major things but the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.750" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">doing applause alia explainable well</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.600" end="00:21:22.500" style="s2">some of them are plausibly explainable</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:24.809" style="s2">and as responses to high-stress</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.500" end="00:21:27.140" style="s2">situations and the Mester plausibly is</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.809" end="00:21:31.770" style="s2">explainable as assault not murder and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:33.929" style="s2">like what Ken can&#39;t really expect that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.770" end="00:21:36.090" style="s2">all these people police who were caught</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.090" end="00:21:41.040" style="s2">journalists etc are going to face</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:49.980" style="s2">don&#39;t have rules anymore and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.270" end="00:21:52.350" style="s2">have anything like it consistent system</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.980" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">punishments anymore we have way too many</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.350" end="00:21:55.650" style="s2">people in prison and we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:58.260" style="s2">lock up the cops any more than we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.650" end="00:22:00.150" style="s2">to lock up the trucks or the innocent</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.260" end="00:22:01.770" style="s2">people in prison were the people who did</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.150" end="00:22:04.770" style="s2">things that should be illegal in prison</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.770" end="00:22:07.020" style="s2">were the things that you know should</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.770" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">sort of be illegal in a sense like tax</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.020" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">evasion but we&#39;re like the laws have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.090" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">be draconian as a deterrent you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">there are a lot of types of people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:20.460" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t want to punish but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:24.810" style="s2">really bad at morality like as a species</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.460" end="00:22:28.050" style="s2">and like we get worse at it as we get</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.810" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">deeper into Imperial decay yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.050" end="00:22:32.340" style="s2">we&#39;re and we&#39;re in late and we&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.340" end="00:22:36.810" style="s2">didn&#39;t you mentioned the number of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.470" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">I&#39;d call middle into moderate level bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.810" end="00:22:40.830" style="s2">actions and which have occurred here but</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:42.690" style="s2">you didn&#39;t mention the worst to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.830" end="00:22:44.580" style="s2">and this is like the worst thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.690" end="00:22:47.100" style="s2">happened in the United States in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.580" end="00:22:50.010" style="s2">lifetime and I&#39;m an old right I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a whole bunch of bad things</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.550" end="00:23:02.490" style="s2">well here&#39;s here&#39;s something that even</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:05.910" style="s2">though it didn&#39;t involve death I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.490" end="00:23:08.310" style="s2">was a moral culpability the worst thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.910" end="00:23:10.110" style="s2">I have ever seen in the Uniting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.310" end="00:23:14.730" style="s2">inside the borders of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.110" end="00:23:17.700" style="s2">and that was Trump using ordering the</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.400" end="00:29:01.090" style="s2">demonstrated that he&#39;s willing to cross</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.090" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">so and so we didn&#39;t move back from drugs</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.630" end="00:29:11.690" style="s2">to the Trump voters and as I said many</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:13.250" style="s2">superb also because that headed towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:15.350" style="s2">the well the police towards the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.250" end="00:29:17.900" style="s2">bureaucracies because that&#39;s what I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.350" end="00:29:20.030" style="s2">think the real problem is and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.900" end="00:29:21.830" style="s2">I am particularly excited about this</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.030" end="00:29:23.780" style="s2">particular proposal like the making of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.830" end="00:29:28.220" style="s2">just full police networks for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.780" end="00:29:30.410" style="s2">and but you know we should limit least</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.220" end="00:29:33.290" style="s2">families as much as we want but like the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.410" end="00:29:35.270" style="s2">ability to investigate Wall Street like</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.290" end="00:29:36.830" style="s2">privately as an individual and bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.270" end="00:29:40.490" style="s2">criminal charges against Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.830" end="00:29:42.740" style="s2">when the stock market is up during the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.490" end="00:29:44.660" style="s2">worst economic disaster of all time</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.740" end="00:29:47.990" style="s2">actually like definitely worse</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.660" end="00:29:49.610" style="s2">depression at this point um it seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.990" end="00:29:51.380" style="s2">kind of weird for the stock market to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.610" end="00:29:56.150" style="s2">way up there&#39;s a lot of market</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.380" end="00:29:57.740" style="s2">manipulation going on um the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.150" end="00:29:58.850" style="s2">I wanted to try to say that Trump</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.740" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">although I don&#39;t want to try to get the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.850" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">last word so you can go manic is he</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:04.820" style="s2">seems to have always been not saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:06.470" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be hard time so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.820" end="00:30:09.140" style="s2">going to make through it yeah instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.470" end="00:30:12.050" style="s2">seems to insisted and driven in a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.140" end="00:30:14.450" style="s2">hard way from the top there in a way</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.050" end="00:30:17.270" style="s2">that strongly pressured all of his</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.450" end="00:30:18.560" style="s2">advisers cheer along with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.270" end="00:30:20.810" style="s2">there was only going to be a sixty</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.560" end="00:30:22.340" style="s2">thousand casualties back when no one</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.810" end="00:30:24.280" style="s2">everyone knew that that couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.340" end="00:30:26.800" style="s2">possible and everyone knew that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.280" end="00:30:29.740" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t remain secret for even a couple</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.800" end="00:30:33.100" style="s2">weeks and I think an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.740" end="00:30:36.490" style="s2">is the only way I can make sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.100" end="00:30:38.500" style="s2">is basically market manipulation it</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.490" end="00:30:40.270" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s this giant market</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.500" end="00:30:42.910" style="s2">madly there&#39;s vast amounts of funds that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.270" end="00:30:45.300" style="s2">are dumping into the market all of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.910" end="00:30:49.210" style="s2">insiders are pulling out into cash and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.300" end="00:30:50.970" style="s2">all of the semi insiders are going into</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.210" end="00:30:54.310" style="s2">the least valuable assets in the market</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.970" end="00:30:57.430" style="s2">it basically makes me think that we that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.310" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">our economy is much much much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.430" end="00:31:01.810" style="s2">centrally controlled than I had any</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.820" style="s2">reason to believe growing up you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.810" end="00:31:06.460" style="s2">like not that much less sense when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.820" end="00:31:08.200" style="s2">control the Soviet Union cause and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.460" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">know that statement makes me bigger</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.200" end="00:31:11.620" style="s2">media is not that much less centrally</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:14.950" style="s2">controlled them before you attend once</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.620" end="00:31:17.650" style="s2">now these sorts of things seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.950" end="00:31:20.170" style="s2">things that we need to root out or if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.650" end="00:31:23.260" style="s2">can&#39;t root them out just come to clarity</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.170" end="00:31:26.050" style="s2">amantha like if we could just recognize</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.260" end="00:31:28.690" style="s2">that the stock market is like a lottery</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.050" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">for real it is for stupid people it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.690" end="00:31:33.460" style="s2">just for taking their money buy and hold</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:35.320" style="s2">is also for stupid people nobody ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.460" end="00:31:37.420" style="s2">made money by betting against Berkshire</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.320" end="00:31:39.940" style="s2">Hathaway until now but it&#39;s a bad good</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.420" end="00:31:41.920" style="s2">bet against Berkshire Hathaway is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.940" end="00:31:44.050" style="s2">great idea in the next next couple years</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.920" end="00:31:47.380" style="s2">that sort of thing yep</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.050" end="00:31:50.140" style="s2">and I think again those sort of stacked</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.380" end="00:31:52.360" style="s2">some bricks up to our to your original</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.140" end="00:31:53.770" style="s2">theme that if we you know stack these</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.360" end="00:31:56.050" style="s2">bricks and bring them to the public</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.770" end="00:31:58.870" style="s2">attention maybe it motivates enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.050" end="00:32:01.300" style="s2">people to move their needle into passive</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.870" end="00:32:03.010" style="s2">aggressive revolution you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.300" end="00:32:04.450" style="s2">threshold as you pointed out you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.010" end="00:32:06.910" style="s2">the threshold to passive-aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.450" end="00:32:08.770" style="s2">revolution is a lot lower than going out</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.910" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">on the street throwing Molotov cocktails</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.770" end="00:32:14.560" style="s2">taking the risk of a rubber bullet and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:16.360" style="s2">astroturf possibly worse so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.560" end="00:32:17.890" style="s2">is actually the most interesting aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:20.980" style="s2">of this idea passive aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.890" end="00:32:21.820" style="s2">revolution is for the individual agents</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.980" end="00:32:25.060" style="s2">and let&#39;s think about from an</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.820" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">agent-based modeling perspective the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.060" end="00:32:29.740" style="s2">risks to the agents pretty low and yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:31.620" style="s2">if there were indeed collective action</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.740" end="00:32:34.270" style="s2">the result could be pretty high and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.620" end="00:32:35.980" style="s2">stacking these outrages one on top of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.270" end="00:32:37.950" style="s2">the other may at some point reach a</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.980" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">critical mass where the agents</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.950" end="00:32:42.419" style="s2">are able to switch their state from you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.470" end="00:32:43.889" style="s2">know just being ordinary Joe&#39;s following</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.419" end="00:32:45.779" style="s2">their nose through life</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.889" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">- now aligning to the passive-aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.779" end="00:32:50.309" style="s2">revolution but it&#39;s the whole CIA</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.620" style="s2">document won&#39;t have a cent ounce of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.309" end="00:32:55.169" style="s2">bureaucracy but you know just by calling</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.620" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">for too many meetings and you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.169" end="00:33:03.389" style="s2">that right I have not but yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.880" style="s2">actually done it though but you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.389" end="00:33:10.500" style="s2">just by native skill so I know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.880" end="00:33:12.210" style="s2">that now we won&#39;t we won&#39;t tell those</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.500" end="00:33:19.950" style="s2">stories they take too long we all got a</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.210" end="00:33:22.139" style="s2">few minutes anyway so well no let&#39;s stop</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.950" end="00:33:24.690" style="s2">let&#39;s stop I know a lot of troubles I</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.800" end="00:36:35.640" style="s2">interesting is the the most dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.960" end="00:36:37.440" style="s2">and this is of course you know talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.640" end="00:36:39.360" style="s2">about chicle Gruber again or Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.440" end="00:36:41.670" style="s2">I&#39;d like to call Schickel Gruber just</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.360" end="00:36:43.980" style="s2">because it drove him crazy that was the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.670" end="00:36:45.900" style="s2">the net his father&#39;s name before his</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.980" end="00:36:49.020" style="s2">father changed his name at like the age</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.900" end="00:36:50.580" style="s2">of 40 could you imagine Heil</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.020" end="00:36:53.540" style="s2">schicklgruber it would not have worked</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.580" end="00:36:56.520" style="s2">too well apparently it sounds very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.540" end="00:37:00.369" style="s2">humorous in German shit&#39;ll do ba</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.520" end="00:37:02.890" style="s2">Highland would never a flaw but</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.369" end="00:37:05.230" style="s2">at that time were often based on your</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.890" end="00:37:07.240" style="s2">class origins because at some point they</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.230" end="00:37:09.880" style="s2">implemented last names I believe and</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.240" end="00:37:13.660" style="s2">people had to buy them and more classy</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.880" end="00:37:15.190" style="s2">70 less things interesting but his</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.660" end="00:37:17.740" style="s2">father was a government bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.190" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">customs officer of middle rank he was</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.740" end="00:37:21.910" style="s2">not poor and he changed his name it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">about the age of 40</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.910" end="00:37:26.109" style="s2">anyway as I saying the other interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:27.849" style="s2">and dangerous and interesting parallel</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.109" end="00:37:32.170" style="s2">is in my view about a third of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.849" end="00:37:33.940" style="s2">voters are cynical people who who</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.170" end="00:37:36.999" style="s2">actually saw through Trump and realized</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.940" end="00:37:39.430" style="s2">in reality he would just be a monkey&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.999" end="00:37:41.740" style="s2">paw for the financial interests you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.430" end="00:37:44.109" style="s2">as demonstrated by the tax cut right</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.740" end="00:37:46.359" style="s2">that damn thing was the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.109" end="00:38:04.210" style="s2">shoveling of money into the wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.359" end="00:38:06.009" style="s2">people&#39;s pockets of all time these</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.210" end="00:38:07.509" style="s2">aren&#39;t of course the money people bunny</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.009" end="00:38:10.230" style="s2">people actually were opposed to Trump</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.509" end="00:38:12.609" style="s2">the wall street vote bet put their</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.230" end="00:38:14.440" style="s2">contributions about 5 to 1 and you for 4</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.609" end="00:38:18.309" style="s2">to 1 against Trump but these are people</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.440" end="00:38:19.989" style="s2">who of upper middle class successful</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.989" end="00:38:25.029" style="s2">million and they say ah Trump will cut</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.690" end="00:38:26.259" style="s2">my taxes and oh by the way probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.029" end="00:38:28.299" style="s2">Trump will be good for the stock market</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.259" end="00:38:36.849" style="s2">and he did both right stock market</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.540" end="00:39:31.770" style="s2">like soft white nationalists who were</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.400" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">a higher level of conformity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.130" end="00:43:50.540" style="s2">willing to commit unlimited violence</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.200" end="00:43:56.870" style="s2">don&#39;t think about bro coach I got to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.550" end="00:43:59.900" style="s2">tell you I fortunately retired before</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.870" end="00:44:01.250" style="s2">that became a thing so you know as far</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.900" end="00:44:04.310" style="s2">as I can tell that didn&#39;t become a thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.250" end="00:44:06.200" style="s2">until about 2000 2001 I was out of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.310" end="00:44:07.910" style="s2">business world at that point so I never</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.200" end="00:44:09.560" style="s2">had to deal with any of them them</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.910" end="00:44:11.480" style="s2"> alrighty I think we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:44:11.480" end="00:44:16.550" style="s2">final thoughts before we sign off this</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:18.910" style="s2">has been interesting and curious tour of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.550" end="00:44:21.590" style="s2">various interest ideas and possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.910" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">so you&#39;ve been involved in chaos theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.590" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">for a long time and you&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:29.300" style="s2">unusually good place to give a</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:32.090" style="s2">scientific opinion about whether a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.300" end="00:44:37.940" style="s2">unified state fair against the American</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.090" end="00:44:40.040" style="s2">military would have effects on is this a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.940" end="00:44:42.500" style="s2">great place to demonstrate the power of</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.040" end="00:44:49.460" style="s2">prayer and establish it for all time as</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.500" end="00:44:51.380" style="s2">a scientific fact you know it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.460" end="00:44:54.320" style="s2">it depends on it like so many things in</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.380" end="00:44:57.410" style="s2">complex systems it depends on many</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.320" end="00:44:59.900" style="s2">different dimensions of analysis I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.410" end="00:45:01.880" style="s2">to pray against the military let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.900" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">pray against the military in world war</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.880" end="00:45:06.380" style="s2">ii not gonna work too well right because</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:09.650" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna assume it&#39;s just a number of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.380" end="00:45:11.860" style="s2">cranks if the military had were actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.650" end="00:45:15.020" style="s2">called out and were slaughtering people</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.860" end="00:45:16.340" style="s2">in the inner cities then i think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.020" end="00:45:18.530" style="s2">probably would work pretty well because</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.340" end="00:45:20.030" style="s2">the cops the the police would military</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.530" end="00:45:21.650" style="s2">would know they&#39;re doing wrong and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.030" end="00:45:23.630" style="s2">they would be accessible to the message</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.650" end="00:45:27.230" style="s2">far more people be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.630" end="00:45:29.900" style="s2">participate in such a prayer so as i is</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.230" end="00:45:32.660" style="s2">entirely context dependent</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.900" end="00:45:34.700" style="s2">the stuff buckets decline we peddle that</p>
