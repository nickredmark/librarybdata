<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:07.859" style="s2">okay so recently like in the past two</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.290" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">days or so Sam Harris put out a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.859" end="00:00:12.929" style="s2">podcast where he was contemplating</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">what&#39;s up what&#39;s going on and in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.929" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">particular piece of content he raised</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">the question or proposed the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">that we are losing our minds and this</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:25.019" style="s2">made me think one of the frames that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve used in the past comes from</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.019" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">Marshall McLuhan and what I&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">is address that particular frame in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:33.780" style="s2">in the context of are we losing our</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">minds and in fact in Simpsons are we in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">the process of transitioning between one</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">kind of mind and another kind of mind so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:41.430" style="s2">we&#39;re both losing and gaining and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:43.829" style="s2">is that maybe a deeper explanation of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.430" end="00:00:48.329" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening so the context</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.829" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">the McLuhan piece is this notion of one</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.329" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">mind so I&#39;m not going to go into exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">what mind is but the idea that mind is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:01:00.090" style="s2">in some very fundamental sense not</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">significantly preconditioned by a notion</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.090" end="00:01:05.729" style="s2">of what extension or body is which is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:09.000" style="s2">say that mind is like a fluid a vessel</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:10.950" style="s2">that fills the the possibility of how</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.000" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">mind relates with the world so</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.950" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">perception and interaction or agency are</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">mediated by some kinds of constructs of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">extensions our hands our eyeballs but</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">also like eyeglasses or telescope this</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">video if I Drive a car or this is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">extension of self extension of body</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.710" style="s2">extension of capacity to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">members and perceive experience and mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.710" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">fits into that it flows into it and has</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">a very sort of ambivalent sense frankly</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">of what our body is but rather is very</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:48.180" style="s2">deeply connected trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">how to be most fundamentally in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.180" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">relationship with what the body can do</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">okay so so for example a really easy</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">metaphor that I&#39;ve found makes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">sense to me is the notion of when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.579" end="00:02:03.540" style="s2">driving a car let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:05.009" style="s2">little you know a little Honda car and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.540" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">you&#39;ve been driving it for years so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.009" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">you&#39;re very connected with it it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">you&#39;re very fluid you can pull into</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">parking spots you can parallel park</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">you can change lanes and there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">of connectedness to it so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:21.299" style="s2">somebody Nick&#39;s the car</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:23.430" style="s2">the response is he hit me not he hit my</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.299" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">car you&#39;re fed sense of self in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.430" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">sense of carving coextensive and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">you rent an RV a big one like a 36-foot</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">you know heavy heavy big RV and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:39.239" style="s2">odd you feel out of sorts you feel a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:40.349" style="s2">weird sense of not being in charge of in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.239" end="00:02:43.019" style="s2">some sense your own body</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.349" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">you can&#39;t feel where your edges are you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.019" end="00:02:46.590" style="s2">can&#39;t feel your front and back are and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">it&#39;s very disconcerting you accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.590" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t accelerate in the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">way you break it isn&#39;t break in the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">way I think that&#39;s kind of the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:02:57.329" style="s2">the sense of embodiment is associated</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">with the mechanisms of our extension ok</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.329" end="00:03:03.569" style="s2">so given that context the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">call media things like say broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.569" end="00:03:09.659" style="s2">television and books and the internet</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">and cell phones are particularly pointed</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.659" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">in this context media deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:19.799" style="s2">affect in particular our capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">for perception of reality of experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.799" end="00:03:24.299" style="s2">and many also very important ways our</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">ways of expression particularly to other</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.299" end="00:03:29.069" style="s2">minds when that&#39;s crucial the other mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:31.109" style="s2">piece of is important it&#39;s that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.069" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">fabric through which we&#39;re able to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.109" end="00:03:34.639" style="s2">relationship with other minds and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">therefore to have a collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.639" end="00:03:37.980" style="s2">perception of reality and a collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">agents in reality collective</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.980" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">so our media is changing my media has</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">changed we&#39;re actually in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.919" style="s2">the consequence of the change there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">a long period of time more or less the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.919" end="00:03:55.560" style="s2">context in which the baby boomers were</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:57.569" style="s2">born and raised that was strictly</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.560" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">dominated by a particular kind of media</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.569" end="00:04:02.849" style="s2">television mostly this television has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:09.000" style="s2">couple of characteristics that I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.849" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">matter in this context one is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.000" end="00:04:13.430" style="s2">thing was the aspect of body that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:15.659" style="s2">being modified by television and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.430" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">audio-visual television is basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.659" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">imagination it&#39;s fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s our capacity to interrelate with</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">story but almost no agency and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">actually go in and change the story</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:30.430" style="s2">you know if you see a small child</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:33.100" style="s2">watching TV the child will try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.430" end="00:04:34.840" style="s2">interact the TV smile point move the TV</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.100" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t interact with a child so it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.840" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">creates a really weird felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">being deeply non-agenda kin relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">with experience and of course television</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">can radically super saturate our</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">sensibility of what experiences the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">television can be much more dramatic it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:53.949" style="s2">can be much more beautiful it can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:55.240" style="s2">much like the people on TV are more</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.949" end="00:04:57.130" style="s2">beautiful than the people you see in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.240" end="00:04:58.990" style="s2">day-to-day life the events and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.130" end="00:05:00.310" style="s2">experiences on TV a more intense than</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.990" end="00:05:02.590" style="s2">the immense experiences of day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.310" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">life so it creates a biasing effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.590" end="00:05:09.009" style="s2">towards narrative towards story towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:12.070" style="s2">dramatization and away from embodied</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.009" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">experience so it&#39;s it&#39;s okay that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.070" end="00:05:16.030" style="s2">two characteristics another one is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a highly asymmetric and I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.030" end="00:05:20.830" style="s2">both in the sense of agency the story</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:22.599" style="s2">flows at you and it flows it has no</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.830" end="00:05:24.099" style="s2">memory by the way you know the thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.599" end="00:05:25.300" style="s2">that just happened maybe you remember it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.099" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re so overwhelmed by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.300" end="00:05:31.210" style="s2">sensorial that your memory is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:32.650" style="s2">piece of this big flux it flows at you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.210" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really flow back at it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.650" end="00:05:36.099" style="s2">you can change the channel but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2">bit like your your agency is to select</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.099" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">which stream that flows through you very</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">little to no capacity to actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">interact back and shift and engage and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:49.539" style="s2">it&#39;s also a symmetric in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:51.669" style="s2">there&#39;s some small number of express</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.539" end="00:05:53.139" style="s2">errs in the television domain that can</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.669" end="00:05:54.880" style="s2">the boomers hear there was like three</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.139" end="00:05:58.780" style="s2">four if you include public television</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.880" end="00:06:00.130" style="s2">she probably shouldn&#39;t and a huge number</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.780" end="00:06:02.440" style="s2">of audience right so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.130" end="00:06:04.419" style="s2">feeling like maybe in the in the early</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.440" end="00:06:07.180" style="s2">80s before cable really mattered that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.419" end="00:06:09.669" style="s2">like monoculture like we all watched the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.180" end="00:06:12.070" style="s2">same show so we&#39;re very entrained to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.669" end="00:06:14.320" style="s2">very small set of ideas and artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.070" end="00:06:16.630" style="s2">and we all watched the same three big</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.320" end="00:06:19.090" style="s2">news shows every night and by the way</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">and this massive asymmetry okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.440" end="00:06:46.550" style="s2">creates a kind of mind this is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">your mind has full boomer Minds in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.550" end="00:06:51.949" style="s2">particular and Gen X reminds to a lesser</p>

<p begin="00:06:51.949" end="00:06:58.430" style="s2">and we shouldn&#39;t underestimate the</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:03.530" style="s2">been very very television and we spent a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:05.449" style="s2">lot of time watching TV in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">cases more than we spent in almost any</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.449" end="00:07:09.710" style="s2">other domain of our lives and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:11.930" style="s2">important in the way that our mind is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.710" end="00:07:13.970" style="s2">right there with the mind has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.930" end="00:07:16.699" style="s2">and flow to fill a particular shape just</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.970" end="00:07:19.220" style="s2">like that Honda but now we&#39;ve switched</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.699" end="00:07:21.229" style="s2">right now much more of our attention is</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.220" end="00:07:22.910" style="s2">spent in a very different media domain</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.229" end="00:07:26.389" style="s2">we&#39;re spending more and more time in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.910" end="00:07:29.419" style="s2">this thing called social media social</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.389" end="00:07:31.550" style="s2">media is different social media has is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.419" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">much more symmetric not fully symmetric</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.550" end="00:07:36.199" style="s2">you know people big Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">personalities your youtubers have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.199" end="00:07:40.099" style="s2">more followers than the average person</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:42.860" style="s2">but the average person has more than</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.099" end="00:07:44.570" style="s2">zero I might have five or seven so</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:45.650" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a higher-level asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.570" end="00:07:47.990" style="s2">and certainly there&#39;s an interactivity</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.650" end="00:07:50.990" style="s2">at the notion that every comment that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.990" end="00:07:52.580" style="s2">someone makes has a response available</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.990" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">and generally expected but if you post</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.580" end="00:07:56.060" style="s2">something on Facebook the expectation is</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">there will be some kind of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.060" end="00:08:01.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not a strictly broadcast medium</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">flowing boo out another key element</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.340" end="00:08:06.860" style="s2">which i think is deeply underestimated</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:08.750" style="s2">which is that if you think about the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:10.280" style="s2">cognitive functions that are most up</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.750" end="00:08:14.449" style="s2">regularly or almost uniquely up</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.280" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">regulated in this new kind of mind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.449" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">memory this is by the way I am taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:23.300" style="s2">very specifically from the guys for at</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:25.849" style="s2">the Center for digital life and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.300" end="00:08:28.490" style="s2">McLuhan people they identified this as</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.849" end="00:08:32.270" style="s2">crucial the Internet is they say never</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.490" end="00:08:34.820" style="s2">forgets right so while our mind in train</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.270" end="00:08:37.669" style="s2">with things like television and radio it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.820" end="00:08:39.649" style="s2">just a flux and our memory is is very</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.669" end="00:08:41.180" style="s2">best partial and not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.649" end="00:08:43.520" style="s2">relevant and certainly the medium has no</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.180" end="00:08:46.010" style="s2">memory I mean in this case the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.520" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">is like a gigantic cybernetic adjunct to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.010" end="00:08:49.880" style="s2">our memory we remember now everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.910" style="s2">every event that happens every tweet</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.880" end="00:08:53.830" style="s2">that occurs every Facebook posted occurs</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.910" end="00:08:56.710" style="s2">somewhere and generally speaking can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.830" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">accessed and also all the events that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.710" end="00:09:00.520" style="s2">occur all the facts like we now have</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:02.830" style="s2">this large capacity to recall facts we</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.520" end="00:09:05.500" style="s2">just didn&#39;t have back then if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.830" end="00:09:07.480" style="s2">millennial or Gen Z you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.500" end="00:09:09.160" style="s2">have as a meaningful connection with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.480" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">experience of being a Boomer or a gen</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.160" end="00:09:13.000" style="s2">Xer where a question comes up like</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:14.290" style="s2">you&#39;re sitting around the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.000" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">and somebody has a question about some</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.290" end="00:09:21.130" style="s2">fact you know who was the the president</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:23.560" style="s2">of Argentina in 1870 some fact like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.130" end="00:09:25.690" style="s2">nobody knows and there&#39;s no way to find</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.560" end="00:09:27.460" style="s2">out like imagine that to be in a context</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.690" end="00:09:29.140" style="s2">where it was actually effectively</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.460" end="00:09:31.690" style="s2">impossible to be able to access a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.140" end="00:09:33.250" style="s2">particular piece of information so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.690" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">mind had to relate to that the really</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.250" end="00:09:39.060" style="s2">mind focused on up-regulated on things</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:40.960" style="s2">like telling good stories in TV era</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.060" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">recognizing that facts didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.960" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">matter that much because most people</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:45.430" style="s2">couldn&#39;t check your facts</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:48.280" style="s2">quality rhetoric quality persuasion now</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.430" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">that&#39;s powerful stuff whereas in the in</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.280" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">the ear of the internet it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">vibe alright there&#39;s definitely ways of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:54.040" style="s2">fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:55.750" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely ways we could put a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.040" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">research and dig deeper and find out</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.750" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and create maps of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.790" end="00:10:02.230" style="s2">of the story of what&#39;s actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.130" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">in reality now of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.230" end="00:10:06.040" style="s2">problematics there&#39;s problems and people</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">being able to generate vast amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.040" end="00:10:09.460" style="s2">information and the challenges of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:11.230" style="s2">figuring out how to sort through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.460" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">noise to get to signal is non-trivial</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.230" end="00:10:14.740" style="s2">it&#39;s a major challenge in the in the age</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:18.820" style="s2">of the internet but it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.740" end="00:10:20.380" style="s2">alright so yes a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.820" end="00:10:23.770" style="s2">people like Tristan Harris call out</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.380" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">which I think Sam Harris&#39;s is a relation</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.770" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">is riffing with having to do with things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:29.470" style="s2">like dopamine addiction and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:31.270" style="s2">attention jacking in asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.470" end="00:10:32.770" style="s2">relationships with AI which are also</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.270" end="00:10:34.750" style="s2">very characteristic pieces of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.770" end="00:10:36.940" style="s2">medium are critical we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.750" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">understand those but what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.940" end="00:10:41.650" style="s2">about I think is also critical that to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">be able to grasp the way that our mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.650" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">flows into and becomes a data into a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:10:48.280" style="s2">particular capacity for perception and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:50.410" style="s2">interaction with experience and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.280" end="00:10:51.910" style="s2">particular with other minds and how that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.410" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">forms a kind of mind that has</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.910" end="00:10:56.830" style="s2">expectations and assumptions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:10:58.690" style="s2">optimizes for certain kinds of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.830" end="00:11:01.120" style="s2">that are upregulated in the in one</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.690" end="00:11:03.130" style="s2">environment and then it finds itself in</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.120" end="00:11:04.600" style="s2">a very different environment so we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.130" end="00:11:05.320" style="s2">yes losing our minds we have in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.600" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">many ways lost</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.320" end="00:11:10.120" style="s2">Carmine&#39;s we are no longer operating in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.540" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">a broadcast consciousness we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.120" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">operating in this new kind of</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.930" end="00:11:48.910" style="s2">expressed itself how that kind of mind</p>
