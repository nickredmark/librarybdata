Our religions have given us definitionsof success. Our pop culture economics
have all given definitions of successthat are partial at best, if not
completely broken. And the people whosucceeded those definitions are in the
process of their success the cause of alot of harm in the world. And so really
waking up to what is a way to be able tohave what I really want occur. And what I
really want is both my selfactualization and me getting to touch
the world in a way that reallyprofoundly changes the world for the
better because everything that I getdies with me but the way that I touch
the world continues on forever. So theinvitation is to join us in really
inquiring into a definition of successthat's meaningful for everyone, the
unique expression for you and thenactually really living that.
