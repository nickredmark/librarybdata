<p begin="00:00:02.010" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">as a development practitioner how would</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:12.000" style="s2">we communicate effectively this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:14.480" style="s2">vision which is very different from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.000" end="00:00:18.740" style="s2">car the world currently with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.480" end="00:00:18.740" style="s2">stakeholders and build a shared vision</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.170" end="00:00:30.500" style="s2">if you&#39;ve had time to look at my book</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">you will see that in my book there are</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.500" end="00:00:37.309" style="s2">250 questions and I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">something very powerful when you shift</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.309" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">any kind of principle any kind of core</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:47.010" style="s2">message that you want to engage somebody</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">with if you frame it as the 10</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.010" end="00:00:53.520" style="s2">commandments or you frame it as the 10</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:55.879" style="s2">principles of regenerative design or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.520" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">8 principles of regenerative economics</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.879" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">then what you ultimately asking people</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">to do is to jump onto your bandwagon to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">follow you to say are we we&#39;ve got these</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:10.229" style="s2">10 principles and if we all follow these</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">principles then we will create a better</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.229" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">world but the minute you turn those 10</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">principles into questions even if</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">they&#39;re loaded questions that in the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:25.860" style="s2">that they are phrased they guide people</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:28.710" style="s2">to a certain way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.860" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">problem in a certain way of acting by</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.710" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">putting it into a question you you take</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.689" style="s2">out the energy behind this come and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">follow me and just sign up and you say</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.689" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">your opinion matters your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">I want to engage with you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:47.399" style="s2">think about this and you enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">dialogue and I think it&#39;s that dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.399" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">that actually does a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">transformation so the for me being a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:01:59.159" style="s2">regenerative practitioner is mastering</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:02.180" style="s2">the art of asking questions and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.159" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">becoming very very skilled in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.180" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">that have people from all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:14.840" style="s2">perspectives in the room and inviting</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:18.810" style="s2">them interests</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.840" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">where you bring people together around</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.810" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">the shared issue a shared problem like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">climate change and then use that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">might be different points of view in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">room and and you invite people into</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">understanding that that diversity just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">as in other biological systems diversity</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">is the core source of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:45.240" style="s2">innovation and and and evolution so is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.060" style="s2">the diversity if we take ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.240" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">serious as part of life then there our</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.060" end="00:02:53.460" style="s2">diversity and our diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">perspectives is also a important source</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.460" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">of creativity so for me what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">experienced that sometimes what happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">when you do that people talk from their</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:11.790" style="s2">professional roles from the academic</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">roles from their business roles and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.790" end="00:03:16.200" style="s2">say one thing and then when you engage</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:19.110" style="s2">with them in the in the tea break or in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.200" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">between the the group conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.110" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">you talk to them about their children</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:26.100" style="s2">and about what they really want out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:27.420" style="s2">life and then you ask them almost the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.100" end="00:03:29.670" style="s2">same question suddenly they say</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.420" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">something completely else so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.670" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of schizophrenia that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">happens between people&#39;s personal truly</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:43.610" style="s2">held emotional like embodied believes</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">and needs and the roles from which they</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.610" end="00:03:50.130" style="s2">re communicate what they&#39;ve learned in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">their professional roles and and so very</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.130" end="00:03:54.390" style="s2">often I find that it&#39;s it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:59.130" style="s2">somehow take people into that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">space of of connecting with with their</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.130" end="00:04:02.460" style="s2">connection to their family with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:05.160" style="s2">connection to the places they really</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.460" end="00:04:08.450" style="s2">care about and and that can can shift</p>
