<p begin="00:00:02.169" end="00:00:09.500" style="s2">It&#39;s my birthday and for my birthday I want<br />what I have wanted for the last 38 years even</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.500" end="00:00:12.840" style="s2">before I was able to verbalize it.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.840" end="00:00:19.130" style="s2">I want world peace an end to poverty solution<br />to the climate change crisis just the basics</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.130" end="00:00:26.970" style="s2">like what all of us want and I think its obtainable<br />If you know me in real life I hope you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.970" end="00:00:30.119" style="s2">me as someone who is both compassionate and<br />intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.119" end="00:00:39.379" style="s2">I, unlike Trump, underestimate my ideas and<br />talents so I do not say this lightly.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.379" end="00:00:43.609" style="s2">This thing inside of me that is trying to<br />get out this idea is one that can save us</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.609" end="00:00:45.379" style="s2">all.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.379" end="00:00:50.059" style="s2">I have spent the last year trying to explain<br />it to the masses and come to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.059" end="00:00:52.210" style="s2">that I am just not that person.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.210" end="00:00:55.719" style="s2">I concentrate too much on the HOW we are going<br />to solve it instead of the WHY that speaks</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.719" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">to people and I have trouble conveying the<br />what i find it too complex</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">This video is an attempt to explain the what<br />I am trying to create to the people who already</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:11.490" style="s2">get the why in hopes of finding the people<br />to cocreate the how.</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.490" end="00:01:17.890" style="s2">The WHY should be obvious if I have to explain<br />to you how our current system is broken you</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.890" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">probably just aren&#39;t my people yet, and that&#39;s<br />OK.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:26.330" style="s2">But if you believe capitalism is inherently<br />broken that it is designed to fail and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.330" end="00:01:30.619" style="s2">needs to be dismantled, peacefully, then you<br />are who I am looking for.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.619" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">The how is complex and I have spent the last<br />few years specifically diving deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:41.140" style="s2">that it involves unleashing our collective<br />power through technology the power of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.140" end="00:01:47.110" style="s2">crowd our own individual passions and an overall<br />shift from a system based on competition to</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.110" end="00:01:48.170" style="s2">one based on cooperation.</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.170" end="00:01:53.170" style="s2">there is not enough time to explain all of<br />the ins and outs but that is about the jist</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.170" end="00:01:59.770" style="s2">of what I can do in that amount of time<br />now to explain the what to the best of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.770" end="00:02:00.770" style="s2">ability.</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.770" end="00:02:03.139" style="s2">This is not so easy for me.</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.139" end="00:02:08.810" style="s2">The best name I have been able to come up<br />with is Technological socialism.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.810" end="00:02:15.700" style="s2">We start with one project which soon becomes<br />the core of a massive global cooperative that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.700" end="00:02:18.510" style="s2">owns everything.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.510" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">We start one project and it devours capitalism<br />from inside.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">We create a global cooperative that will eventually<br />own nearly everything.</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:33.260" style="s2">We start with technology because it is cheap<br />and has infinite potential but we do move</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.260" end="00:02:35.540" style="s2">on to the entire means of production.</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.540" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">When it makes sense for us to own factories<br />and mines we buy factories and mines.</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:46.569" style="s2">We create an online space that is designed<br />for collaboration.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.569" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">Once that space is in existence we are then<br />able to create other technology from that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:03:01.659" style="s2">Once we create the space for us to collaborate<br />on projects it unleashes our own human potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.659" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">because we are able to find projects that<br />speak to us and contribute in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">meaningful to us and creating that platform<br />is easy that is not what is complex.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:21.319" style="s2">If we had Facebook that was designed for collaboration<br />and contribution instead of for profit and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.319" end="00:03:28.830" style="s2">we all owned it and it was run through democracy<br />and transparency think about what we could</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.830" end="00:03:29.830" style="s2">do.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.830" end="00:03:30.830" style="s2">And that is what I am trying to create.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.830" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">I need people who want to co create a world<br />where we have zero poverty where climate change</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">and other environmental catastrophes are a<br />priority we don&#39;t just gloss over in the name</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:44.099" style="s2">of economics.</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.099" end="00:03:48.520" style="s2">I just need those people so if you could please<br />share this video I need to find the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.520" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">who want to co create that world people who<br />want to put their time and energy into creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:56.320" style="s2">a system based on cooperation in hopes of<br />creating a better world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.320" end="00:04:00.189" style="s2">Not in hopes I can see the path I can see<br />it very clearly I just canâ€™t explain it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.189" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">all in a 5 minute video.</p>
