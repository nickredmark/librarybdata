<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:39.530" style="s2">different kinds of systems okay so to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">begin the the first kind of system is</p>

<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">broadly speaking unchanging and for</p>

<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:46.140" style="s2">therefore predictable so what happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:47.450" style="s2">when you&#39;re in a complicated system say</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.140" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">for example you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.450" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">tic-tac-toe is that the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">approach is to to see how much of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">face space how much of the central</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">states the system you can in fact grasp</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">with precision if it&#39;s a simple system</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">like tic-tac-toe</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">then you can grasp all of it in which</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:14.050" style="s2">simply identify with clarity exactly</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:17.590" style="s2">what the outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.050" end="00:02:21.220" style="s2">a beach move and then execute would be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.590" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">perfect approach if the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.220" end="00:02:24.250" style="s2">system is too large for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.370" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.250" end="00:02:30.220" style="s2">say for example again our Boeing 777</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.370" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">where it&#39;s sort of impossible for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.220" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">to endeavor to grasp in its totality</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:39.910" style="s2">nonetheless one can become an expert and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:41.710" style="s2">develop a lot of skill in predicting how</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.910" end="00:02:42.850" style="s2">it will respond to different inputs and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.710" end="00:02:47.140" style="s2">outputs because remember the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.850" end="00:02:51.850" style="s2">day it&#39;s finite and bounded and with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.140" end="00:02:53.650" style="s2">properly constructed crew of experts we</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.850" end="00:02:58.060" style="s2">can affect go about managing that system</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.650" end="00:02:59.320" style="s2">very effectively and efficiently whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.060" end="00:03:02.470" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about building one or</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.320" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">maintaining one this is fine and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.470" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">more or less what our civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">very good at doing it&#39;s very good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:11.110" style="s2">partitioning identifying complicated</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">systems and then beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.110" end="00:03:15.460" style="s2">construction of three levels of</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.460" end="00:03:22.570" style="s2">them energy this brings us to a complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.780" end="00:03:25.600" style="s2">systems so we&#39;re a complicated system is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.570" end="00:03:27.910" style="s2">defined by the fact that its phase space</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:30.580" style="s2">is finite and bounded and that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.910" end="00:03:34.750" style="s2">relationship between cause and effect is</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:36.880" style="s2">clear and predictable a complex space is</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.750" end="00:03:40.150" style="s2">kind of the opposite wishes to say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.880" end="00:03:43.420" style="s2">its phase space is about the States that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.150" end="00:03:45.640" style="s2">it can occupy are themselves changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.420" end="00:03:49.620" style="s2">the kinds of states that it can occupy</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.640" end="00:03:52.360" style="s2">are changing so it&#39;s a phase space is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.620" end="00:03:55.900" style="s2">unbounded and as a consequence infinite</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.360" end="00:03:57.820" style="s2">and for oolitic reasons the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.900" end="00:04:00.610" style="s2">between cause and effect in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.820" end="00:04:03.390" style="s2">system is unclear</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.610" end="00:04:06.850" style="s2">it is difficult and sometimes in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.390" end="00:04:09.489" style="s2">close to impossible to predict the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.850" end="00:04:12.790" style="s2">that the system will respond to a given</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.489" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">input this does not mean however their</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.790" end="00:04:17.830" style="s2">complex system can&#39;t be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:20.769" style="s2">effectively it just requires a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.830" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">approach and so the appropriate approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.769" end="00:04:27.979" style="s2">to a complex system is to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">be responsive to its disposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.979" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">while you cannot predict and while cause</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">and effect are unclear in complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">systems you do have correlations</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">it has probabilities that can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:45.240" style="s2">identified with some level of confidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:47.699" style="s2">it has a disposition and while this</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.240" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">disposition is going to drift if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.699" end="00:04:54.949" style="s2">become skillful at having sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">the subtle signals of the system and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.949" end="00:05:01.740" style="s2">become skillful in exploring the state</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:04.110" style="s2">and the space and the drift of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.740" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">complex system then you can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.110" end="00:05:07.889" style="s2">it effectively or more precisely</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:10.919" style="s2">adaptively</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.889" end="00:05:14.039" style="s2">and this is the right way to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.919" end="00:05:16.470" style="s2">a complex system for me the economical</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.039" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">example here is circuit you&#39;re surfing</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.470" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a highly complex</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.289" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">very unclear and things are changing</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.630" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">culling there&#39;s no two times</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:56.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to surf the same wave</p>

<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:05.460" style="s2">can build a capacity to become a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.419" end="00:06:07.560" style="s2">skillful surfer and achieve something</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.460" end="00:06:14.120" style="s2">that would be properly termed beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.560" end="00:06:16.380" style="s2">and then this brings us to chaos if in</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.120" end="00:06:17.669" style="s2">complication the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.380" end="00:06:21.389" style="s2">cause and effect is clear and</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.720" end="00:06:34.199" style="s2">ourselves in a circumstance where even</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.199" end="00:06:41.310" style="s2">in a chaotic system we have no basis for</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:41.849" style="s2">making good choices so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.310" end="00:06:43.800" style="s2">easier to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.849" end="00:06:45.270" style="s2">jump to the example here we can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.800" end="00:06:47.699" style="s2">that we&#39;re on one of those enormous</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.270" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">waves that Laird Hamilton made famous</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:05.699" style="s2">tail bubbles everywhere and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.580" end="00:07:09.149" style="s2">effectively pitch-black so this is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.699" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">we have no idea which way is up and if</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.149" end="00:07:14.759" style="s2">we were to endeavor to swim to what we</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:16.499" style="s2">may think is up we&#39;re just as likely to</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.740" end="00:07:37.019" style="s2">the way that one responds to chaos is to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.059" end="00:07:41.069" style="s2">wait to slow down to conserve your</p>
