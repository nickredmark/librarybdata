<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:08.130" style="s2">I keep seeing on the internet a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.380" end="00:00:10.500" style="s2">people really concerned about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re taking the drastic steps we</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.500" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">are and the impact it&#39;s having on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:19.080" style="s2">economy when the numbers aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">close to the annual flu rate and so in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.080" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">hopes that people&#39;s lack of math skills</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t kill us all I&#39;m doing this video</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">to explain why kovat 19 is not the flu</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">and it is so much worse without giving</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">you a math lesson even though I will be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">bringing numbers into it so with the flu</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">that when you have the flu the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:40.110" style="s2">percentage of people that you infect on</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">an average basis is 1.3 which means when</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.110" end="00:00:45.270" style="s2">you&#39;re recovered you leave one person</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:48.930" style="s2">behind plus about a 30% increase the are</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.270" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">for kovat 19 is 2 to 3 which means if</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.930" end="00:00:52.230" style="s2">you&#39;re out in the world infecting people</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">you&#39;re doubling or tripling the amount</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.230" end="00:00:58.050" style="s2">of people infected in a very short</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">period of time the death rate is much</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.050" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">higher the numbers right now for the flu</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:05.909" style="s2">are higher on the annual basis but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">flu runs its course we know what that</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.909" end="00:01:11.460" style="s2">does that&#39;s the annual rate we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">how far into the year and we already</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.460" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">have 2 over 10,000 deaths from this</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">thing so they we know that the death</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:22.650" style="s2">rate for the flu is roughly one in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">thousand the death rate for Kovan 19 is</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.650" end="00:01:27.720" style="s2">30 out of a thousand this is 30 times</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:30.900" style="s2">more deadly than the flu we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.720" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">afford for it to be as rampant as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.900" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">flu especially since the incubation</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:37.829" style="s2">period for this thing is 5 to 14 days</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">some people are asymptomatic genes</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">they&#39;re out spreading it around without</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">knowing that&#39;s why we&#39;re in our houses</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.770" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">socially isolating so we can hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">curb this and flatten the curve the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">exposure the incubation period for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">flu is 1 to 4 days and you know you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">it you&#39;re a key your although you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">be infectious for one day before you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">start to show symptoms you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">infectious for a week before you start</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">to show symptoms the math on this thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">makes it makes it scary it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:08.179" style="s2">perfect disease just infection to spread</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">throughout the population</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.179" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">it&#39;s the perfect infectious disease</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">our politicians I&#39;m the first to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:18.629" style="s2">that they cannot handle complex issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">they cannot understand things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.629" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">extrapolate to the future but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:24.209" style="s2">the best we have right now and we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:27.930" style="s2">to be listening to the advice they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.209" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">giving not without thinking about it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.930" end="00:02:31.769" style="s2">understand that if you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:32.310" style="s2">the complex math the it&#39;s not even that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.769" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:37.580" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the math of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">exponential growth and death rate</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.580" end="00:02:42.120" style="s2">percentages then please leave it up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">the experts please leave it up to those</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.120" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">of us who&#39;ve passed high school math and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">university math to say this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:50.549" style="s2">different there&#39;s a reason we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">staying home our governments are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.549" end="00:02:55.860" style="s2">taking our would not be shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">our economies to the extent they have if</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.860" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t as serious it as it is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.730" style="s2">don&#39;t have mass collusion on a global</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">level this would have to be the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.730" end="00:03:08.209" style="s2">conspiracy theory every time it hits a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:11.579" style="s2">new country the politicians scramble</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.209" end="00:03:13.860" style="s2">wait to do lockdown until way too late</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.579" end="00:03:16.079" style="s2">and we can see that playing out again</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.860" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">and again and again we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.079" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">the rest we right now it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:22.410" style="s2">flattening the curve and keeping as many</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">people alive as possible who would die</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.410" end="00:03:26.220" style="s2">for this thing then we can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:28.049" style="s2">how we feed ourselves how we get our</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.220" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">economy back if that&#39;s if that&#39;s what</p>
