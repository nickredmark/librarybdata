<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">love it anyway the main reason i reached</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">out to you was i saw a discussion on</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">twitter about switchboard</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">which is her company that provides tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">for online communities</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:14.319" style="s2">but as i dug deeper i found that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">quite a bit more story</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.319" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">about switchboard and how you decided to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">grow it and pace it and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">but let&#39;s start by having you tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">little bit about what switchboard does</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">and who some of your customers are etc</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">sure well switchboard is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:33.920" style="s2">platform and i guess it&#39;s more of a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">less of a platform and it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.920" end="00:02:39.519" style="s2">way of thinking that the world exists so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">that&#39;s always um you know every time you</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.519" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">create a technology product</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">my parents are artists and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">technology product is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">sort of technology is the medium and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">then what you are communicating</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">is really what the product is to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">and so the medium in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.440" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:59.200" style="s2">and what we are communicating with</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.440" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">switchboard and what we deeply believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.200" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">is an and the notion of mutualistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:08.879" style="s2">relationships within community and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">when you think about how that happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.879" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">what the verbs are</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">the engine that drives this human</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">potential to give</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">and receive you can think of it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">of asks and offers</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">um so our human nature is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">one in which at times we are vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.920" style="s2">and we need to ask for help</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">and we come to our community from a</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.920" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">place of need</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">and there are times when we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">resources that we can offer and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">coming from a place of generosity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">spirit</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">this ask and offer cycle is embodied</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">quite deeply in communities of artists</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s a feast and famine mentality</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">you know you may go and not sell a piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">for a month or two and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">call on your community you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">and then you suddenly sell a few pieces</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">and now you&#39;re flush</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">and so now you&#39;re able to give there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">no keeping tabs</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">there&#39;s not an accounting system for it</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">embedded in our dna as people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">what keeps</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">society moving it is the original social</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">safety net</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">so we took that premise of ask an offer</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">and this engine of generosity and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">began to we created a technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">platform for the community that has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">most influential in my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">which is that of reed college which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">where i went to college</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">and what we were seeing i graduated in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">2001</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">you know right after that recession and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">colonels for the idea of switchboard</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">were born in 2008-2009</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">in that recession and we started to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">students that were graduating</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">and had no net of love to catch them</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">and a number of alumni friends and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">20 of us got together we approached the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">college and said</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">how can we help you call us and ask us</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">for money every year but how can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">provide the generosity of our networks</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">our connection</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t have a method to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">career services was one office alumni</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">affairs was another office student</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">affairs was another office</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">and never the twain shall meet and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">then higher education that actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">largely is still the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">and so we helped them to solve this</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">um and they had said to us what are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">gonna do are we going to just stick your</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">resumes on the bulletin board like</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.880" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">how are we going to create these</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">connections and we incentivize them we</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">said look we really want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">we&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">40 for every student that you connect us</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">it was a ten thousand dollar pledge to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">the college between all of us which at</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">that time</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">it was extraordinary it was the highest</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">we would have ever given many of us were</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">still paying off our student loans</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">they didn&#39;t have a mechanism for making</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">that connection and so we introduced</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">them to the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">and um uh my co-founder sean lerner who</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">i happened to meet on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">was generous enough to start to work on</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">this platform of asks and offers</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">um we were doing it informally through a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">bananas ways that i don&#39;t get into but</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">we saw this real need that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">students were asking for jobs</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">internships mentorship connection advice</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">hospitality</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">and you had alumni willing to offer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">same it was a two-sided marketplace that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a connection point</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">so we launched it at read and then it</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">just took off there have been i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">over 40 000 connections that have made</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">that have been made it&#39;s now been going</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">for that particular switchboard has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">going for almost eight years</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">and it&#39;s just been extraordinary what</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">has yielded through this network of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">generosity</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">um so through that experience we saw oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">we have a scalable platform and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">scalable technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">and so switchboard the company was born</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">and and we were then able to partner</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">with other</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">colleges universities we also have</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">startup communities farmers the public</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:06.400" style="s2">defenders office of oregon</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:08.560" style="s2">business associations philanthropy we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.400" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">now gone into many more sectors</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.560" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">to essentially provide this engine</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">to connect their community and grow in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">sustainable way that&#39;s really providing</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:19.759" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.039" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">to their members first yeah i love the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.759" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">idea and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.800" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s elegant that you focused on</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">essentially a transaction but doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">have the baggage</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">of you know a traditional i&#39;ll bill you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">blah blah i&#39;ll ship you something</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">transaction the ask</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">and offer metaphor very beautiful who</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">came up with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s the way that we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">always been organized as people</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">i was profoundly influenced by the work</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">of lewis hyde</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">and his book called the gift in which he</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">talks about this notion of human</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">altruism being like a gift that ripples</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">through community</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">and what lewis hyde says as the gift</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">must always move</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">so that concept it just</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">struck me like i couldn&#39;t stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">about it it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">it was like an immutable truth that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">if i were to say one thing that exists</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">it&#39;s when the gift is moving we are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">better people and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">currency what we&#39;re looking at now with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">the massive</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">economic injustice and the racial wealth</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">gap</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">whether it&#39;s resources whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">access to health care</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">this notion of the unequal distribution</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">of the gift</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">and the gift kind of being this creative</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">energy that keeps us all healthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">and human the way that he articulated it</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">and lewis hyde was speaking</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">about um i think it&#39;s called the erotic</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">he uses this this term the erotic to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">describe the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">that the gift exchange is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">you know coming from currency current</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">this current is what keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">healthy bonded and our communities</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">sustainable and thriving</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">so i think his his work just had the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">most profound effect and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">my lived experience of being a child of</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">artists and seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">that play out again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">and yeah i love it it fits very much</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">into the kinds of things myself and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">other folks in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">community have been thinking about which</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">is you know our current world</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">game a as we call it is utterly</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">dominated if you don&#39;t watch yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">very carefully by the short term money</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">on money return</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">loop which i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">later when we get to entrepreneurial</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">finance</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">right so many people are utterly</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">dominated by</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:40.560" style="s2">does this move make money for me in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">short term right</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.560" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t have to be the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">signal in a social system</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">and the thing that makes our current</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">status quo so</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">strange and so alienating is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">only this one</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">signal that dominates all the others and</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">you know i&#39;d suggest that this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">network of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">asks and offers which are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">gift economies more or less is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">completely legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">first-class social signaling system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">to the degree we have more of that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">will tend to reduce the impact of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.920" style="s2">money on money return loop yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.240" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">and you know i think i would even</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.920" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">go so far as to say that actually money</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">will be tied to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">in the future so i think you know people</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">like me and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.519" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">and so many others that have come before</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">us have been encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">a game b approach because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">we&#39;re motivated from an ethical place we</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">know that it&#39;s right we know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s needed we know this is the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">sincere authentic place to operate from</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">but in this moment i i would go out on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">limb and say that community</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">is absolutely tethered to capital</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">that when you have a strong community</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">when you&#39;ve invested in the success</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">of your students your alumni your end</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">users the public whoever it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:00.640" style="s2">serve</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">when the time comes to approach them for</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">a financial ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">so that you can continue to serve them</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">because they received value up front the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">financial transaction won&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">to be felt as extractive because the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">value</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">receiving and what they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re asking them for it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:25.680" style="s2">you know give first it&#39;s the principle</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">of giving first if we design networks</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.680" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">from a place of giving first</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">and then the ask comes from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">saying hey in order to continue to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">this work</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">to level it up to include more people</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">to broaden our reach we are asking you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:41.440" style="s2">to give</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">people are now believers and i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.440" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">that that will extend</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">to brands to institutions you know and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to i want to be clear i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">not talking about like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">commodification of community</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about the community really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">being the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.320" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">reason that you exist and so the value</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">reflective of the value that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">receive</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">interesting a good vision inclusive i</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">would suggest though it&#39;s least worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:10.800" style="s2">considering and again from this theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">of differentiated social signaling</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">that it might be right i could easily be</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">wrong to not commingle</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">the money signal and the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:23.760" style="s2">signal on the same platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">i might be wrong but i just suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.760" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">adding the money</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">transaction into the gift economy ask an</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">offer platform will somehow compromise</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">and the two together can be used to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">build a larger ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:38.800" style="s2">so it might be good to keep those piece</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">parts separate</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.800" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">absolutely yeah well i think um i agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">with the separation i think we&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:46.639" style="s2">into a moment that we don&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.639" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">which is how the co-mingling happens in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">ways and that requires having very</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">honest conversations about a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">biases and trauma towards currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:03.760" style="s2">that have been used currency and capital</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:05.120" style="s2">has been used as a divisive power</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.760" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.120" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">and i loved what richard bartlett had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">say in his interview with you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">um you know talking about this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">transvestment</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">where there&#39;s something powerful in</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.959" style="s2">taking the capital</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">and not demonizing the capital itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.959" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">saying what can we do that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">with what is essentially this pot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.600" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">and the that requires i think a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.600" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">conversation for us as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">to to separate</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">the biases and extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">feelings that we have towards money from</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">how we grew up and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">what we see happening socially and who</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.079" style="s2">has it and who does it and who gets it</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:46.880" style="s2">and who does it and who has access and</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.079" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.880" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s used as a weapon right now and so i</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">one of the responsibilities of game b</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">is to de-weaponize to demilitarize</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">what is fundamentally energy i agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:05.440" style="s2">and in fact one things i would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">for vocabulary at least i try to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.440" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">is not just talk about capital and money</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">but rather to expand the idea to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">for instance in some of the experimental</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">doing planning the first proto-b&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:22.720" style="s2">will be the first small-scale game b</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">communities we are thinking about having</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.720" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">resources which are vested in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">community irrespective of money</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">including housing food and child care</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:34.079" style="s2">they will just become</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">part of the substrate and no money</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.079" end="00:14:37.600" style="s2">changes hands right</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">obviously money has to flow at a higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.600" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">level to enable those things to happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">but we can decapitalize and demonetize</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">a significant part of the substrate</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:49.519" style="s2">necessary for life</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m pretty sure that that will</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.519" end="00:14:53.120" style="s2">change a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">about how we think you point how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.120" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">raised people that are raised in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">environment will have a different</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.800" style="s2">relationship to money money will be for</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">the extra special things not just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.800" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">to survive right which gives it that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">weird and dire</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">edge sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">yeah i couldn&#39;t agree with you more i</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">mean i think about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">i think you know we&#39;re living through so</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">many moments in history at once</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">but for me when i think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">work that i&#39;ve done with access to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">and really the the way that black lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">matter has started to mobilize</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">access to capital for black brown and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">indigenous founders</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">you know i think concurrent to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">experiments like yours</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">that don&#39;t use that resource because we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:42.000" style="s2">have resources through time and talent</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">as an artist and as someone that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.000" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">profoundly impacted by small amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">i really want to see capital be put to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">different use</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">as well and so when i see founders</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">of color and entrepreneurs get that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">twenty thousand dollar seed check</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">when i see a first time black fund</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">manager you know raise</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">twenty three million dollars as um the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">brian braking did today</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">i am ecstatic it&#39;s not because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">rooting for the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">system and the status quo it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">like a paintbrush and paint being put in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.720" end="00:16:21.440" style="s2">the hands of a different artist</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m just so excited to see what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">those different resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">or what those resources look the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">resources in different hands</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">like what they create so i&#39;m coming from</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">a cultural perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">of wanting to see the culture change</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">with the redistribution and deployment</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">of those resources</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">um so i think i just think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">culturally possible is quite astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">when we use capital in that way as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">so i for me it&#39;s a both and strategy of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">how can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">so how can we render it um as your plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">b</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">describes of not that important but also</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:01.199" style="s2">when we do use it how can it just be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">used</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.199" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">fundamentally in a more creative fashion</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:07.839" style="s2">and in fact i would argue that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">make it less important for your mere</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">existence it actually makes it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.039" style="s2">more interesting to do out there kinds</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.039" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">right because if you don&#39;t have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">about oh if i lose my little</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">nest egg i might starve right say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll do something wacky with my little</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">nest egg</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">and if i lose it oh well you know my</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">family doesn&#39;t end up on the street</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:29.919" style="s2">and i think that will actually make for</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">a more dynamic culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.919" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">by a long shot to say the least and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">think i just one</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">point on that that i think is really</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">interesting is um</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">there is something that capital does</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:42.160" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been thinking about a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">i would actually love to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:45.520" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">if you&#39;d be open to sharing which is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.520" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">instills</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">confidence so when i was</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">16 years old i received a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">transformational check</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">of patronage from a woman i had never</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">met for fourteen hundred dollars so i</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">could do an internship in washington dc</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">and it was like it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">life-changing it everything that my</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">whole life can be traced to that moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:10.720" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t the sixteen hundred</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">dollars it was like someone believed in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.720" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">and there was a pretty blunt object</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">symbol</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">that could communicate that belief and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:21.200" style="s2">that has happened in my life</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:22.880" style="s2">over and over again raising my first</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.200" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">investment for my company</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.880" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">i see it with my niece right now who</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">just started a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">she has a lip gloss business and when</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">she closes a sale</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:35.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not this purely capitalistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">transaction i see her</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.039" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">her confidence in that she&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">level up</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">into new skills and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">the money is this energy that&#39;s allowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">you to level up</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">because you feel as though you have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">foundation under your feet so i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">similar to your point</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">if that thing is already taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">it allows you to level up</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">but i think a lot about like how is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">already taken care of is it something</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">that you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">brought someone along on the vision for</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">and that is like a foundational act of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">to verbalize a vision for the future</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:14.240" style="s2">and for another person with an open</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">heart to hear it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:18.720" style="s2">and believe in it so much that they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">put that resource down that feels so</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.720" end="00:19:23.760" style="s2">out of grasp so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">anyway i just love the nuance of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.760" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">conversation but i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">about that a lot actually so i</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">appreciate you bringing it up but i</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">you know you had that experience it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">sounds like of growing up from</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">in relatively modest means and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">know exiting all of these companies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">i&#39;m just curious in your own</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">entrepreneurial journey when you got</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">that first check or like that first</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">capital do you have memories of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">that was like for you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">oh hell yes yeah and you know my father</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">dropped out of high school after</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">ninth grade my mother left home when she</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">was 14 you know so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">i grew up in working class lower middle</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">class my dad was a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:01.679" style="s2">big city cop you know so i wouldn&#39;t say</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.679" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">affluent either</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">some ways the perfect way to grow up and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">frankly i took advantage of that in my</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">career</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">you know which and you know again sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">of the accidents of our trajectories we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">can extract</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">lessons from and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">helped me tremendously in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">put this in my advice to a lot of young</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">people is always</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">even when you&#39;re making minimum wage you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">can still save 10 percent</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">you know imagine somebody chopping jute</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">in bangladesh right they&#39;re a shitload</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.760" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">and some low interest loans and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">anyway live cheap save money so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.280" style="s2">could generate your own small amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">working capital</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.280" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">to start being able to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">but you&#39;re right that first as i still</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">laugh about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">my very first startup i was not the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">founding founder there was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">much older guy who had had a track</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">record</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">as an entrepreneur and he and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">connected somehow and he</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.080" style="s2">talked me into you know considering</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">becoming part of his venture and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.080" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">know we were working on the business</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:34.320" style="s2">plan nights and weekends i went up there</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">on my vacation</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.320" end="00:21:37.760" style="s2">i was living in virginia he lived in</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">boston and you know we finished the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.760" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">business plan</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">he then circulated it to some folks and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">based on the fact that five</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">people came up with twenty five thousand</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.520" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">dollars twenty five thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">my wife and i quit our fairly decent</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">jobs in virginia and moved to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">and that was utterly transformational in</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">but it goes back to the other one you</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">know we had always lived</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">cheap at save money owed money to nobody</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">paid off our student loans had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">couple of cheap cars and so hence we</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:12.559" style="s2">could quit</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s a place of privilege to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">move into conceptions of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:52.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">are you know post currency and</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">but i do think that in the interim</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">that character needs to play a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">part in more people&#39;s stories</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">and as we&#39;re moving towards game b we</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s something you know to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">have a conversation where two people</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">i think that the more creative</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">distribution of that catalytic small</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">capital is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">is going to be such a joy to witness</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m here for that story as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">absolutely you know if you follow the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">trajectory of that 25 000</p>

<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">in fact to your point this amazing</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">in fact she is a founding</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">member of something called virginia food</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:23.200" style="s2">shed capital</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:24.480" style="s2">and what they do is collect money we put</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.200" end="00:24:26.960" style="s2">in a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.480" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">and they lend it out to sustainable</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">farmers in central virginia at zero</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">oh that&#39;s great yeah and for catalytic</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">that will allow a farmer to level up so</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">for instance one</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">person had a very good business doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">greens and vegetables and stuff at three</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">or four farmers markets</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">but because they didn&#39;t have storage</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">they really couldn&#39;t play in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">wholesale marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">and so they put in a grant for i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">it was like 7 500 for a cold box right</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">and that 7 500 completely changed how</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">they could do business they could couple</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">larger marketplaces over in the big</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">valley across the mountain from us</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">and could substantially lever their</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">business up and it&#39;s just changed their</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">life 7 500</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">and the sweet spot for virginia food</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">shed capital is between</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">thousand and fifty thousand dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">you know on the scale of venture capital</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">you know that&#39;s less than the lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">bill typically right</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">to get the deal done and these</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">investments they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">a number of them now have transformed</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.600" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">this local permaculture food economy</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">that we care so much about so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">example of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">being able to use capital in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:37.840" style="s2">non-traditional way</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:39.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s not being given away it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">loaned but it&#39;s being loaned at zero</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.279" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">so that is not you know burdensome</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">compounding interest</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">for people oh i love it i yeah i just</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">encourage everyone who&#39;s listening to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:51.360" style="s2">find something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:52.960" style="s2">my colleague astrid schultz and i with</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.360" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">the zebras unite are working on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.960" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">project</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">realized that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">lack of access to capital is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.520" style="s2">problem and it&#39;s a long story as to why</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">but essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.520" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">traditional banks and credit unions are</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">no longer providing</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">our local communities with the capital</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">that they need on the terms that work</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">and they aren&#39;t frankly understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:24.799" style="s2">their businesses and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">you have a massive misalignment between</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.799" end="00:26:27.919" style="s2">what capital is out there and then what</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.919" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">which is you know these gaps of five to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">fifty thousand dollars at zero interest</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">that will have profound impacts on local</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">and so we are starting to see the rise</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">in the wake of the gutting of community</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">lenders after the 2008-2009 financial</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">there was a consolidation of these banks</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.080" style="s2">and credit unions and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">in the financial interest of big banks</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.080" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">to be lending</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">loans under a million dollars and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">just pure business you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re able to underwrite one million</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense to do 20 at 50 000</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s taking 20 times more time for your</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">staff and for your back office</p>

<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">and so these big lenders and you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.440" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">this now playing out with</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">ppp loan this is what it looks like at</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">scale to shove</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">500 billion dollars through the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">and see who benefits</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">um but so there&#39;s this huge opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">new types of um capital systems like the</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be surprised i&#39;d be curious</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">to know if there were farmers that were</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">involved in the creation of this because</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">their lived</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">problem showed them that there needed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">be a solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">um so that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">comes to the inclusive capital</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">these funds that are distributed all</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">across the country</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing from you know new</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">mexico to kentucky to</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">rural places um you know to detroit</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">these place-based loan funds are our</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">entrepreneurs and founders and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">community itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">that are designing their own solutions</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">absolutely i have to look into that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">inclusive capital collective is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">what it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">yep it&#39;s icc it hasn&#39;t come out formally</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">as anything we&#39;re sort of behind the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.440" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">scenes</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">constellating this group um the ironic</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">challenge to access to capital is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of primary capital out</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">there um</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">but the checks are so big so take for</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">example oregon&#39;s public pension fund you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">know these are public employees</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">paying into a pension system that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">pension fund is a hundred billion</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">dollars if you can believe it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">the largest pension funds in the country</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:45.679" style="s2">well when that pension fund wants to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">invest the minimum check size they write</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.679" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">is you know maybe 50 million it&#39;s 50 to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">200 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">well i&#39;m sure that the funds that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">invested at i can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">is it more than two to five million oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s at this point</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot less than that it&#39;s i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">know what that i have to ask my wife but</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">i&#39;d be surprised if it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">a million dollars and it&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">operation if the total loan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">outstanding or even a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">and truthfully the funding is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">you know rattle the tin cup</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">get some money make some more loans</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">right so yeah certainly not 50 million</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">dollars why do you mention that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.880" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">transformational</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">it is and it as you point out the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">current institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">because as you point out if you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">obeying the signal of short-term money</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">on money return</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">it is difficult for a bank to do a ten</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">thousand dollar loan</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">because it costs them almost as much as</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">to do a million dollar loan</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s also funny you mentioned about</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">the impact capital i sat on an</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:42.960" style="s2">investment board for the state of new</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">mexico</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.960" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">state endowment which we had 17 billion</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">dollars under management and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">we had to approve all the you know major</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">allocations of capital and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">we did all kinds of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">alternative investments but our minimum</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">was 50 million dollars right</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">and most of these interesting niches are</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">not ready</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:03.360" style="s2">to accept 50 million maybe they will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">someday</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">but there has to be other sources of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">capital that can get there</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">if you&#39;d like i&#39;d be happy to chat with</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">you and maybe connect my wife too and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:13.760" style="s2">you guys talking about this inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">capital collective because i have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">of ideas about how to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">interesting forms of finance and capital</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">that don&#39;t fit in any of the usual</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">buckets</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">you know one of the things i learned was</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.520" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">that one of the beauties of the english</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">common law system which we live in here</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">is that you can do almost anything you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">can imagine in forms of structure and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">capital you just have to imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:38.240" style="s2">then you write it up and don&#39;t force</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">yourself to be constrained by okay we</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.240" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">only have</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">preferred a&#39;s or c corpse or you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">truth matter is if you can state it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">me in language that parses</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">i can probably tell somebody how to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">a legal entity to do that and a capital</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">structure that at least in theory</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">could achieve that the world is much</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">more plastic than we tend to think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">it as</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">because we look at role models quote</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">unquote they did it this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">well that&#39;s not the only way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:09.360" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">you know and i love that i that you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.360" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">that experience in new mexico and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">i kind of i call it it&#39;s it&#39;s too big to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">you know you wouldn&#39;t have the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">for deploying that capital</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">into the local community and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">result if you&#39;re trying to park 50</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">you have to go out of state often out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">often into private equity that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">directly undercuts the community&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">needs and so my colleague astrid schultz</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">describes it as</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">getting the capital into the capillaries</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">right if it has to pass through this big</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.440" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">in order to reach the small thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">experiment that we&#39;re working on with</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">the icc is well if you have 70 loan</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:50.559" style="s2">funds that are each doing a million</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.559" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">suddenly that&#39;s a 70 million dollar fund</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">so how do you create this collective</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">and so you come out looking bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">and now you are a big enough size such</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">that you can start to get institutional</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">capital</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">and then instead of that going into</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">bigger places out of state out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">you&#39;ve created the container so it can</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">be distributed to the local capillaries</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.519" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">so i am such a fan of people like you</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">that are curious to think about these</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">creative structures</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:24.799" style="s2">and i think you know for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">out there i know jim and i are now</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.799" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">walking out on access to capital it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">fascinating i just can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.320" style="s2">emphasize it enough but to bring it down</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">to um</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">the quality of the communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:49.839" style="s2">not the quantity of communities and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">know again</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.839" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">to the point that if you just build them</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">they will not come maybe you get paid</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">for a while but you&#39;re not building a</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">sustainable cycle</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">of value-add maybe you could talk a</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">little bit about how you came to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">realize that it was quality not quantity</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">that you wanted to proceed</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">to build and what implications that had</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">for the company</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s a great question well</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.680" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">so we switchboard went into a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">unusual incubator called portland</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">incubator experiment or pi</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.760" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">which at the time was part of wyden and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">kennedy in portland</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">which is a legendary advertising firm</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">that coined</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">nikes just do it and so we were lucky</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">because we weren&#39;t put into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">traditional</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">you know startup meat grinder of growth</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">hacking your way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">your series a and yet we still talked to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">a lot of investors and they looked at</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">switchboard and they said okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">only way to grow this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">is to take out facebook ads and you need</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">to growth hack it</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">and you need to create automated seed</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">seeded posts</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">and they were looking at it thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">like how do we growth hack our way</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">to this and everyone saw the promise and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">potential of the platform</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">but the only way they could imagine</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">success was by</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">this hockey stick um of inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">and for people that are community</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">organizers at their core that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:14.880" style="s2">just anathema um so switchboard is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">called switchboard because you need</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.880" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">human operators and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">howard said in your interview that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">early imaginings of the internet were to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">be an</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">augment really augment human</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">intelligence and so that means that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in relationship a human is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">relationship with technology and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">quality relationship is key switchboard</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">operators</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:38.240" style="s2">um those people that come in and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:41.680" style="s2">steward and shepherd and catalyze</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.240" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s such an overlooked art</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.680" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">so interestingly as we started to grow</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">switchboard down a sustainable path</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">we would only partner with institutions</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">that were ready for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">and it was a big mindset shift to move</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:55.839" style="s2">from an extractive relational model</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.119" style="s2">to one of service and care and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.839" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.119" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">and we ended up building a services arm</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:04.480" style="s2">on top of our company</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">so um you know services obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.480" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">human to human whether that&#39;s training</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:13.119" style="s2">coaching workshops but what we found was</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">that this quality of catalyzing</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.119" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">stewarding shepherding tending watering</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">feeding</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">growing nurturing that is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">field of unto itself it&#39;s a skill set it</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">requires tremendous emotional</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:29.839" style="s2">the people that have it frankly are</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">often overlooked</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.839" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">members it&#39;s it&#39;s the lowest paid job in</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">any food chain</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s so taken for granted and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">then what we saw is we started to work</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">with more</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">institutions was that this core</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.800" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">competency</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:46.319" style="s2">didn&#39;t even exist in the institution um</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">it had become so calcified</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.319" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">and so used to extractive ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">operating</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">that if you came in to an alumni affairs</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">or career services office and said</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;re flipping the playbook here so</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">instead of extracting</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">dollars you&#39;re giving of yourself enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re stewarding these earnest</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">vulnerable posts towards success within</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">your community</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:12.240" style="s2">we would be met with blank stares</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">because that wasn&#39;t a competency</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.240" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">within their organization so chelsea</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">herring who is then our chief operating</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">officer</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:22.400" style="s2">had the brilliant genius idea to layer</p>

<p begin="00:41:22.400" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">so when people came to us and said well</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">we built it but no one came</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t just rug our shoulders we</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">would have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">services arm of strategists and helpers</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">at the ready to have them conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">that community looked like so in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">becoming a tech enabled consultancy</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">or you know a company that offered both</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:47.839" style="s2">tech and training</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">that is like kryptonite to investors</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.839" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">because the first thing they&#39;ll say to</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:53.760" style="s2">you is like well that doesn&#39;t scale</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">humans don&#39;t scale um you know vcs are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">trying to get to the quickest buck the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">fastest most automated</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">you know chat bot way that they can</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">without humans the more humans the worse</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">of a proposition it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">so for us to come and say you know to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">your question how did it impact the</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">it was an extraordinary leap of faith to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:16.240" style="s2">say we can&#39;t compromise on this</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">um and and so that meant not being able</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.240" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">to pursue the venture capital path and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">and really</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">searching for these unicorns of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">investors that could see</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">stewardship</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">with a tool like switchboard very</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">as i mentioned i&#39;ve been fooling with</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:39.280" style="s2">online communities since the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">and finding those community managers the</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2">is not easy right because it&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">be a big ego person</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">forceful because sometimes you got to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">make tough decisions</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:55.920" style="s2">but you also have to be open and</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.920" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">very hard thing to find good people to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.319" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">what was your criteria for the community</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t what role</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">yeah well we call them stewards or</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">operators</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">um the archetype that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">about yeah yeah i hope you do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">show just on that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.280" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">well so what&#39;s powerful you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">switchboard just this week merged with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:25.280" style="s2">company called harkin</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">and harkin means to listen and harkin</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.280" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">had been proving</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">out the same theory of change as</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">switchboard but in journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">newsrooms and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">the uh ceo jennifer brandell and i have</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">been kind of sisters along this startup</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">journey and jen</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">felt the same way about media as i did</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">in higher ed which was</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">the equation is all wrong the audience</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">your public should be driving coverage</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">so you need to create a container where</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">they can ask questions of reporters</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">and then the newsrooms reorientation</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:56.960" style="s2">becomes serving the knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">information needs of</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.960" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">the audience not making assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">and responding to press releases about</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">what you think they need to know</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">and jen has been a huge inspiration in</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">my life so both of us are trained as</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">reporters</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">we think a lot about listening</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">and i think about it especially from a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">place of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">being very curious about ministry</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.640" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">about the way that it unfolds in call</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">and response</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">in traditions of black churches about</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">the way that silence</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">and meditation and listening is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">important in monastic communities</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">the way that the quakers</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">use it in their meeting house format it</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">all comes down to listening it comes</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">down to creating this a container of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">safety</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">and where people can be vulnerable which</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">is you know as you do this with your</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">podcast jim and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">you are an exemplar of this so from</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">it&#39;s can this person create a safe</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">container</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">are they able to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">emotional resonance and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">vibration of the word and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">many of us have found that musicians are</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">extraordinarily gifted</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">at this tonal it&#39;s like a primitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">tonal</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">ability to listen for emotion and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">from there</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">we started to see that reporters and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">journalists</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">actually had a tremendous capability for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">this which is why the switchboard harken</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">merge makes so much sense and why we</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">have so many former reporters on our</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">team</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">journalists went into the business you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">know many of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">to be of service to provide information</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">to strengthen communities to listen</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">they operate from a place of deep</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">curiosity the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">best ones operate from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:50.000" style="s2">empathy and justice</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">and so if you were to ask me you know i</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.000" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">think social workers also come from this</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">and so the criteria is about that sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.839" style="s2">of selfless</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.640" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">egoless service where the human is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.839" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">becoming the container and the container</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">is um is allowing for bigger work to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">unfold</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">inside of that container but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">criteria</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:14.800" style="s2">is you know exactly to your point</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">there&#39;s not like a job description or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">resume and so we</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">are constantly on the search for these</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:21.520" style="s2">types of people so if you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">we are generally</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.520" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">there&#39;s always some open role so please</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">go to we are harkin.com</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">but we are always interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">connecting with those people and we find</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">journalism social service front-facing</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">hospitality work especially</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">um you know we we have extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">number of parents on our team</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">because raising children requires that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">skill as well so we don&#39;t see that as a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">liability it&#39;s a core part</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">of the way that we serve our partners</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:54.400" style="s2">you know communities of faith ministry</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s all of these spaces that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.400" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">constantly devalued and we just see it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">as being the highest value work</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">very well said i think you have the best</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">perception i&#39;ve yet</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">heard about this role and we both know</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">having watched people try to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard right this is not an</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:14.480" style="s2">easy thing for people to get good at</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.720" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">and i think you&#39;ve identified some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.480" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">the the sources for the kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:19.599" style="s2">who have at least the capability of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">getting good at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.599" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">is there anything you guys do in terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">of do you have a training method or a</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">methodology</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">that you have your people use that helps</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">rather than the old trial and error</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">yeah well um the new ceo</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.319" style="s2">the second is amplification so once that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.319" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">established you want to be the other</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">person&#39;s evangelist</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.319" style="s2">as much as possible you know so whether</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.680" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">because so much of our human desire is</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">so we can be the shepherd of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">experience for</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">them then comes recognition so how do</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">express gratitude how do you celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">provide</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">shout outs share success stories which</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">is again this behavioral reaffirmation</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">that that vulnerability is now safe</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s success along the path and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">then empathy as so acknowledgement and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">understanding of that lived experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">and this framework was kind of built off</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:01.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">a lot of the research that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.920" end="00:49:05.359" style="s2">around the hero&#39;s journey you know and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">all of joseph campbell&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.359" end="00:49:09.359" style="s2">of thinking of you know each ask is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">essentially like the hero sets out with</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.359" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">uncertainty right</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:14.559" style="s2">they encounter their helpers very often</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">they encounter blockers</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.559" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">that will block their success and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">the way that they move through this</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:21.760" style="s2">place of success is to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">back and share it back with their</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.760" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">so this is sort of a chelsea&#39;s genius</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.079" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">adaptation of this four</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.839" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">part process of the narrative arc of</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">going from that place of vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">to safety to security to being helped</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">to then being empowered enough to come</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">back to the community to</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">to drive that resource forward and model</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.480" style="s2">it so we do a ton of training but you</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">know to your point</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.480" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">in terms of it being a hard job i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">it starts with all of us as childhood in</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">childhood and you know we&#39;ll sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">have trainings where</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">some of the opening questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:50:00.160" style="s2">ask are like how old were you</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">when you were first heard when you felt</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.160" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">that someone was really listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">and who was that person</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s heartbreaking it&#39;s to hear</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">people say</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">i was 18 i was 19 i was in my 20s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">i had the extraordinary good fortune of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">what i had to say mattered when i was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">toddler you know i remember adults</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">taking me seriously and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">deep attention that they gave my words</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">i think at the job of it to your point</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:32.240" style="s2">it it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">coming from um a lot of trauma that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.240" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">have about not being heard</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.920" style="s2">and i think the second trauma that so</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">many of us encounter is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.920" end="00:50:41.440" style="s2">being told you know that moment that all</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">of us have had in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.440" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">school or on the playground where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">asked a question and you were told that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">it was a stupid question</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">and the similar heartbreak of once</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">you&#39;re told that it&#39;s not safe to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">it cuts that experience off for you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:59.680" style="s2">as a person potentially for the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">your life it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.680" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">heartbreaking um and so we in some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">the workshops that we do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">that allow for more vulnerability my</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">interest is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">in always getting down to those root</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:16.000" style="s2">being heard being vulnerable and being</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.000" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">and whether that was allowed for in your</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">because the degree to which you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">to steward other communities is only</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">reflective of your own lived experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:29.599" style="s2">of being treated that way yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">wow that&#39;s that&#39;s eloquent make sure you</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.599" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">email me a link to that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:36.240" style="s2">work i will and we&#39;ll put it on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">episode page and as we always do all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.240" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">things we talk about here will be</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:41.200" style="s2">on the episode page you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">take two careful notes they&#39;ll be there</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.200" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">for you to go to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">that sounds like again about the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:48.800" style="s2">dive into this space that i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.800" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">never really focused on that much</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">i was lucky too and that both of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:55.200" style="s2">parents</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why i mean you know they</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.200" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">were relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">though my mother is extremely smart they</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">weren&#39;t highly educated</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:04.240" style="s2">but they somehow knew or the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">to do was to take your kids seriously</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.240" end="00:52:09.280" style="s2">from the very beginning right they never</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">told me don&#39;t ask that question or shut</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">up or</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">time to go to bed whatever they both</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">took us</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">kids seriously from as early as i can</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">remember which is back to three or four</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.040" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">and they told us stuff which is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">like the household budget and how it</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">worked and</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.599" end="00:52:27.119" style="s2">you know okay we still have loans on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">deep freeze which means we can&#39;t buy a</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.119" end="00:52:30.319" style="s2">dishwasher until that&#39;s paid off it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">probably seven or eight that we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.319" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">these kinds of discussions so they</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">treated us in a serious and mature</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:38.079" style="s2">fashion from an early age and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">really hadn&#39;t focused on that before</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.079" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">that that might be unusual</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">but i guess it is yeah i i</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">i would encourage you to ask people you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:48.640" style="s2">know it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:49.839" style="s2">really illuminating question if they</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">would think that they were taken</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.839" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">as a child that&#39;s a great question i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">been thinking a lot about politics</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">lately like what what are the political</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">parties that we need in the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">or do we even need parties you know but</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">obviously what we have now is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">serving anyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">and um i think if i were to run on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">platform or design one it would actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:10.160" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.839" style="s2">exactly as you described it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.160" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">policy platform of taking children</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.839" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">because it takes the future seriously</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of having um like quote</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">unquote progressive future thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">policy by centering it on the lived</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">the literal future which is children and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">um i you know i was listening to whitney</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.280" end="00:53:35.599" style="s2">houston&#39;s i believe the children are our</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.599" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been going quite deep into</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">monasticism and church fathers desert</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">fathers</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:46.960" style="s2">to i kind of read in strange places</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">sometimes but this notion</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.960" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">of being a child of god and this posture</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">of being childlike and what that if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">if you live in the world from a place of</p>

<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">towards</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.960" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">right so they may</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">be equal to 50 votes from some old fart</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">like me</p>

<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">if the weights of the children were</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">actually stronger than the weights of</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.359" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">enough about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">this imagination um experiment i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.079" style="s2">doing because</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">you know obviously it goes without</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.079" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">saying the education policy what would</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">the um our environmental policy</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">would have to account for that i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">is this you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">this is certainly not new of course</p>

<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m certainly not this is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">not claiming that this is a new idea at</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to think of a way in</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">which it could become</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:56:01.599" style="s2">a cultural an easy cultural standard</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s comprehensible so yeah we should</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.599" end="00:56:04.640" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">talking about it yeah yeah let&#39;s do it</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">i love it i love it very congruent very</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:12.079" style="s2">congruent let&#39;s switch back from the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">you know very interesting esoteric and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.079" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">out there on the edge how to completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">reform</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">democracy to something more prosecute</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s got to be very important in</p>

<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">matter the same theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">holds up and jen brandel is the</p>

<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">say in the merger announcement which i</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:38.799" style="s2">just love</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">she says of all the the lessons these</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.799" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">experiences have yielded the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:44.160" style="s2">key one is this the way to build energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">and the power to affect change is not by</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.160" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">asking people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">already have power to share it or give</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">but to find colleagues customers</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">investors and other leaders who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.920" style="s2">interested in similar problems and are</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">new power so</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.760" style="s2">that is i think the core that ties</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:07.119" style="s2">together these companies</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.760" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">is it&#39;s an act of creation for all these</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.119" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">to generate new power and to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">it to more and different people so what</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">that means</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">kind of practically for me is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">company is now integrated</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been co-delivering services</p>

<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">informs what i believe i can contribute</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">to creating</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s just a really intimate</p>

<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">it meant that we had to get off of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:54.640" style="s2">venture capital on-ramp</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">of startups and there&#39;s not a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">it was the response was utterly</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:01.359" style="s2">overwhelming and we spent the next year</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">listening to founders and investors and</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.559" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">mutualistic</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:36.559" style="s2">that the spoil you know that instead of</p>

<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:40.480" style="s2">new funds and then we&#39;ve been working at</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">the community level</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.480" end="01:04:44.240" style="s2">with the um all of these chapters that</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.160" style="s2">have sprung up out of</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.240" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">you know we had no idea that so many</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:48.640" style="s2">people wanted to be chapter leads we now</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">chapters in singapore and japan and um</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:58.480" style="s2">mexico city and london and berlin just</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2">had an event yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.480" end="01:05:01.920" style="s2">so essentially it&#39;s this three-prong</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.480" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">approach of how you create an</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.920" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">organization that</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">can advance culture change capital</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:10.079" style="s2">and community and i won&#39;t bore people</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">with the deep details but you</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.079" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">essentially create three different</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">organizations to do that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">so we&#39;ve just finished that big</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">operational infrastructure lift</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">and in the coming months we will be</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">launching the cooperative so that people</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:25.280" style="s2">can join</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">and become members what we&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.280" end="01:05:29.280" style="s2">know we launched a we did a huge zebra</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">survey which will be coming out as well</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.280" end="01:05:32.400" style="s2">next week</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:34.319" style="s2">and in that survey we just heard that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.400" end="01:05:35.920" style="s2">the predominant feeling of zebra</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.319" end="01:05:37.119" style="s2">founders is a sense of profound</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.920" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">isolation</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t know that they they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:42.240" style="s2">know where to find their community they</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">want to do things differently but there</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.240" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">aren&#39;t alternative models</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">and so we feel really lucky to be kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:51.440" style="s2">of this umbrella</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">that is sharing resources of frankly</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.440" end="01:05:54.000" style="s2">things that have already existed for</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">quite a long time</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.000" end="01:05:58.000" style="s2">like cooperative structures but that may</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">not have received broad</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.000" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">mainstream attention um and and trying</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:03.359" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">socialize those alternative ownership</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.359" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">and governance structures</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:09.280" style="s2">as we think about a more just</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:11.280" style="s2">post-pandemic economy</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.280" end="01:06:12.559" style="s2">wow sounds really good you know very</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.280" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">similar to some things that we think</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.559" end="01:06:16.160" style="s2">about in the game b space</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">you know the idea of how to powerize</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.160" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">cooperatives is one i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:20.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">on and off for six or seven years and</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.480" end="01:06:24.400" style="s2">kind of fallen into</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.000" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">one set of ideas that are called hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.400" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">that still have the one person one vote</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">rule etc and have dividends to</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:34.079" style="s2">either the employees or the customers or</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:36.319" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.079" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">but turns out the law of cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.319" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">does allow</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:40.480" style="s2">so-called hybrids where you can have</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.960" style="s2">outside finance</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.480" end="01:06:44.400" style="s2">but it typically is best if it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.960" end="01:06:46.079" style="s2">heavily capped</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.400" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">in terms of its return so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.079" end="01:06:49.760" style="s2">owning equity per se</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">but on the other hand i always find debt</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.760" end="01:06:53.599" style="s2">to be dangerous right because</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">you know if you don&#39;t pay your loan back</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.599" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">you know you miss two months you&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">of business potentially and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:06:59.680" style="s2">certainly a cooperative doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">that and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.680" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">my favorite structure for hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">cooperatives</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:08.480" style="s2">is using preferred stock as the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:10.079" style="s2">financing vehicle the preferred stock is</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.480" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">often overlooked it&#39;s an odd little</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.079" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">creature that lives in the land between</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">common stock and debt what we can think</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:17.760" style="s2">about in this context is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.760" end="01:07:21.520" style="s2">debt that you don&#39;t have to meet the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">payment every month and if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.520" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">don&#39;t something bad doesn&#39;t happen now</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:26.880" style="s2">it will start to compound at a somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">higher interest rate</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.880" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">but they can&#39;t seize control of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:31.760" style="s2">company so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">quite interesting that these hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.760" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2">cooperatives are a way to crack the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:37.839" style="s2">age-old problem of cooperatives which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">okay suppose you want to operate a meat</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.839" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">packing plant as a cooperative you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">it costs a couple million dollars to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.119" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">into the meat packing</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">business and you know the 50 employees</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.480" style="s2">typically relatively low wage employees</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.799" end="01:07:49.440" style="s2">who want to start a cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">where the hell they&#39;re going to get a</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.440" end="01:07:52.079" style="s2">million two million dollars right the</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:53.200" style="s2">bank&#39;s not going to give it to them</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.079" end="01:07:55.839" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.200" end="01:07:57.440" style="s2">and this idea of hybrid where you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.839" end="01:08:00.000" style="s2">some fixed return</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.440" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">little downside capital structure looks</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.000" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">to me at least pretty encouraging</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">have you guys explored the hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">cooperative structure at all</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">we have yeah and i love that you brought</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">that up um</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so nice to geek out on things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:16.560" style="s2">are i don&#39;t know that i could geek out</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">with anyone else um so jason weiner is</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.560" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">lawyer have you come across his work uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:22.560" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:23.839" style="s2">on cooperatives okay yeah you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.560" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">like you need um</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.839" end="01:08:27.199" style="s2">these underground lawyers that have been</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">like you know digging at this with a</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.199" end="01:08:32.000" style="s2">spoon for years to try to crack this nut</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:33.600" style="s2">but he is our uh he&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:35.120" style="s2">innovative cooperative lawyer and has</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.600" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">actually been working with the main</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.120" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">um cooperative body the legislative body</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">to be create more nuanced um for lack of</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">a better word like term sheets or more</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">more nuanced bylaws i suppose so that</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:51.120" style="s2">cooperatives can incorporate with</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">multiple layers of shareholders which</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:54.400" style="s2">has been one of the primary obstacles as</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">you identified</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.400" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">you have this one you know one</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:00.960" style="s2">shareholder one vote model</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:01.839" style="s2">but if you have for example founders</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.960" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">that have come in</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.839" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">and put a ton of sweat equity into it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:08.319" style="s2">how are they compensated</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:09.520" style="s2">if you have early members that have put</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.319" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">in sweat equity</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.520" end="01:09:13.839" style="s2">in in time or talent if you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">investors that are financing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.839" end="01:09:17.120" style="s2">um and so it was only really in the last</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">couple of years</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.120" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">that the bylaws have been um creatively</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">amended so that you can have</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">these more creative structures where you</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:26.719" style="s2">have shareholders that you have an</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:28.560" style="s2">investor class</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.719" end="01:09:31.199" style="s2">but they may not have voting rights</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.560" end="01:09:33.759" style="s2">right so to your point how do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.199" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">some investors may want to be hands-on</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.759" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">and the governance other investors may</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:37.440" style="s2">just want to put capital in and get</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:39.839" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.440" end="01:09:41.679" style="s2">you know interest back institutional</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.839" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">partners where they could invest but</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.679" end="01:09:46.080" style="s2">they have a vested interest</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">by participating in the governance</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.080" end="01:09:49.199" style="s2">founding members so people that might be</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:51.839" style="s2">putting in</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.199" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">um a certain number of hours to get the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.839" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">organization up and running how do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">recognize that you know early belief um</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.120" end="01:10:01.360" style="s2">the founders themselves and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">interested i&#39;ll share with you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.360" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:06.000" style="s2">the structure for how we created this</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">hybrid cooperative allows for those</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.000" end="01:10:10.640" style="s2">different classes of shareholders</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.000" end="01:10:11.280" style="s2">and then interestingly that cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.640" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">jointly owns the fund so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:17.679" style="s2">the investment vehicle um which is an</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">llc</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.679" end="01:10:21.600" style="s2">is jointly owned by zebras unite and by</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">second muse which is our</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.600" end="01:10:26.239" style="s2">um fund management collaborator so what</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">that means then is that as</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.239" end="01:10:30.239" style="s2">dividends are returned from the fund as</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.400" style="s2">we invest in zebra founders</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.239" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">those dividends go back into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.400" end="01:10:35.199" style="s2">cooperative</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">and then to make things even more</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.199" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">creative um the golden share</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:43.920" style="s2">so kind of the the north star share</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">of our cooperative is held by our 501c3</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.920" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">which is our educational</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:49.040" style="s2">mission you know our mission to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">and sustain</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:52.640" style="s2">and promote more zebras to come into</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:54.640" style="s2">existence and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.640" end="01:10:56.719" style="s2">you maintain the mission by having the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.640" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">c3 have that golden share</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.719" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">so as you can tell it&#39;s like these three</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">different structures</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.840" style="s2">stapled together to create a mutualistic</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">interrelated</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.840" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">relationship where you know and it just</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">took a tremendous amount of really</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">creative legal</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">legal thinking i love it but it allows</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.880" style="s2">us to kind of operate</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:18.960" style="s2">at all of the altitudes that we want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.880" end="01:11:20.719" style="s2">um and also hopefully become a</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.960" end="01:11:22.239" style="s2">model and a playbook and a blueprint for</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">others that are thinking about creative</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.239" end="01:11:26.239" style="s2">hybrid structures as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:27.760" style="s2">oh great you have taken you know i did a</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.239" end="01:11:29.520" style="s2">little research on this few years back</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.760" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve taken it to a whole new level i</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.520" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">love this</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">and you know to the point we were making</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">earlier that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">beauty of the english common law system</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">is you can actually do this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:41.199" style="s2">it&#39;s just hard right and you need to</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:43.600" style="s2">find a lawyer or</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.199" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">develop the expertise yourself to think</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:47.679" style="s2">outside the box and not just to do what</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">everybody else has done and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.679" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">it does take time and it does take</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:53.920" style="s2">effort and i&#39;ve pulled up the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">website of jrweiner.com who seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.920" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">your lawyer is that the guy</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:59.760" style="s2">yep exactly looking at his stuff here i</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:01.679" style="s2">go shit i want to talk to this guy next</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.760" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">time i have a project like this</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.679" end="01:12:05.520" style="s2">love the work you&#39;ve done and i would</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">strongly encourage you to document it</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.520" end="01:12:09.040" style="s2">and get it out there</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">what we call in the game b world x in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.040" end="01:12:12.800" style="s2">box right so</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">to a degree you can put it in a box and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.800" end="01:12:16.320" style="s2">keep in mind people the box is not a box</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">that you can&#39;t change i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">describe it&#39;s like kraft macaroni and</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:20.719" style="s2">cheese right</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:23.120" style="s2">who the hell wants to eat plain old</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.719" end="01:12:25.199" style="s2">kraft macaroni and cheese but if you add</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.120" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">you know half a pound of gear cheese to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.199" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">it a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:30.080" style="s2">ground deer sausage it&#39;s a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">better right</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.080" end="01:12:33.760" style="s2">so i would strongly encourage you guys</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:36.000" style="s2">to invest a bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.760" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">in explaining how you&#39;ve done it you</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">know and if you&#39;re willing to put your</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:40.960" style="s2">documents up online</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:42.480" style="s2">etc so that other people can do the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.960" end="01:12:44.320" style="s2">thing without having to go up the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.480" end="01:12:46.400" style="s2">learning curve</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.320" end="01:12:47.679" style="s2">gladly yeah i mean that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.400" end="01:12:50.480" style="s2">around the education</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.679" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">and um you know cooperatives are</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.480" end="01:12:52.960" style="s2">education is like a core part of their</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:12:54.480" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.960" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">um and that was really why that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.480" end="01:12:58.159" style="s2">structure resonated so much with us was</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:12:59.679" style="s2">everything we were doing we realized</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.159" end="01:13:01.120" style="s2">that while it was painful to do the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.679" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">first time</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.120" end="01:13:04.960" style="s2">we could then blueprint it so that</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:05.920" style="s2">others could spare themselves the same</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.960" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.920" end="01:13:10.080" style="s2">i feel that way with our merge as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:13.440" style="s2">you know going through the merge process</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.080" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">lawyers are incentivized to protract</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.440" end="01:13:16.400" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">and for them to be adversarial and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.400" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">you know what happens if you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">parties that agree on the terms and</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:25.120" style="s2">it can be just a very amicable union you</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:27.360" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.120" end="01:13:28.800" style="s2">and so we learned a lot in that merge</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.360" end="01:13:30.080" style="s2">process that we&#39;re hoping to teach</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.800" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">forward as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.080" end="01:13:34.560" style="s2">uh i think in the future i can&#39;t wait to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:36.320" style="s2">see more mergers happening of</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.560" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">aligned businesses that recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.320" end="01:13:40.080" style="s2">they&#39;re stronger together</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:42.159" style="s2">but the merge process uh the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.080" end="01:13:42.800" style="s2">time the cost of legal fees can be so</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.159" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">daunting</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.800" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">that you know jen and i wished that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:49.199" style="s2">had had a playbook at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">that&#39;s like okay this is what you need</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.199" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">to figure out and here are some</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">worksheets</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">um so very very much a big fan of what</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">you&#39;re describing of teaching it forward</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:00.400" style="s2">i love it sounds like you guys are you</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">know not only doing you know right in</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.400" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">your own organization but</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">the words i like to use you&#39;re lowering</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:06.000" style="s2">the activation energy for the people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.000" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">next oh gosh may it be used for that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:14.719" style="s2">otherwise it would be so painful that</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:15.280" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be worth doing exactly you</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.719" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.280" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">and once we lower the activation energy</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">a classic catalyst in chemistry terms</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">you know what that means it means more</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:26.159" style="s2">reactions can happen</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:28.239" style="s2">more good-faith non-lawyer-infested</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.159" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">mergers can happen more hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:31.679" style="s2">cooperatives can be formed</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">very important concept the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.679" end="01:14:34.480" style="s2">lowering the activation energy via</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.520" end="01:14:36.640" style="s2">catalysis</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.480" end="01:14:38.239" style="s2">in this case the you know the toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.640" end="01:14:40.000" style="s2">that&#39;s made available to people and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.239" end="01:14:40.640" style="s2">learning that this is even possible</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.000" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.640" end="01:14:44.239" style="s2">it&#39;s you know admirable that you guys</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:44.880" style="s2">even figured out this was possible most</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.239" end="01:14:46.640" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.880" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">won&#39;t think outside the box enough to</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.640" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">realize it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">and then even better you weren&#39;t scared</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:52.960" style="s2">off by the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:54.560" style="s2">large amount of work that&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.960" end="01:14:56.800" style="s2">make it happen so you know</p>

<p begin="01:15:00.480" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">world so other people can do it without</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">having to go all through that</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:07.440" style="s2">it would be a damn good thing yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:09.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.440" end="01:15:10.560" style="s2">i think the the blessing and the curse</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.520" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">of it is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.560" end="01:15:13.840" style="s2">you then need brave and courageous</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:16.560" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.840" end="01:15:16.960" style="s2">you know so you need to find capital</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.560" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.960" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">rewards this and it&#39;s been um</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:24.080" style="s2">a real you know we have had people that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.320" end="01:15:27.679" style="s2">have provided us with capital to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.080" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">courageous and to dream and to come up</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.679" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">with these creative structures and</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">i can&#39;t tell you how life-changing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:36.320" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:37.760" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also a status quo of um</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.320" end="01:15:39.360" style="s2">people you know that will see this</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.760" end="01:15:42.800" style="s2">creative solution and ask</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.360" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">kind of questions that are like they</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.800" end="01:15:47.040" style="s2">they will want to see things</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.080" end="01:15:48.960" style="s2">that are status quo and so all of us are</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.040" end="01:15:51.440" style="s2">navigating the you know like a full-time</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.960" end="01:15:53.040" style="s2">executive director that&#39;s paid 200 000</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.440" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">in a cooperative let&#39;s say or something</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.040" end="01:15:55.679" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s like that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:59.280" style="s2">to exist</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.679" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">so what about if it were for people</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:03.440" style="s2">that were putting in sweat equity and</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:04.320" style="s2">each making a little on the side and you</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:06.000" style="s2">know i think your</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:07.360" style="s2">your interview with richard got at this</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:08.880" style="s2">a lot which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.360" end="01:16:10.800" style="s2">to the degree to which we&#39;re cat we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:13.679" style="s2">creative in the creation</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.800" end="01:16:14.320" style="s2">and the catalyzing of this energy</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.679" end="01:16:16.640" style="s2">savings</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.320" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">that leads to innovation it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.640" end="01:16:21.199" style="s2">tennis ball that has to be hit back</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">with resources to actually resource</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.199" end="01:16:24.400" style="s2">these organizations</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">and that just requires a level of</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.400" end="01:16:27.679" style="s2">imagination</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:29.440" style="s2">within the funding and investing</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.679" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">community that we&#39;re starting to see and</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.440" end="01:16:32.080" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.000" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">always love to connect with and see more</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.080" end="01:16:35.920" style="s2">of so the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t you know it&#39;s not going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.920" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">future and so these new things are scary</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:42.239" style="s2">and hybrid and</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">kind of stapled together with duct tape</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.239" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">um but we really believe in the promise</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:48.640" style="s2">of them as models</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:50.800" style="s2">for the future cool i like it</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.640" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">you know i commend you for not going</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.800" end="01:16:55.520" style="s2">down the damn road of executive director</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.040" end="01:16:57.280" style="s2">who hires a grant writer whose job is to</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.520" end="01:16:59.760" style="s2">get more grants so they can write more</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:01.520" style="s2">grants right we saw that trap in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.760" end="01:17:03.840" style="s2">maker space community</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.520" end="01:17:04.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know six years ago i helped a</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.840" end="01:17:07.520" style="s2">guy in our</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.719" end="01:17:09.120" style="s2">local town start a makerspace and one of</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.520" end="01:17:10.080" style="s2">the first things we did was examine what</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.120" end="01:17:12.320" style="s2">other people had done</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:13.840" style="s2">an awful lot of them had gotten on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">fundraising treadmill</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.840" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">and we said nope we&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:17.760" style="s2">differently and to this day the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:20.159" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.760" end="01:17:21.600" style="s2">quite big it&#39;s got its own 6 500 square</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.159" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">foot facility</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.600" end="01:17:26.239" style="s2">amazing equipment etc and to this day</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve never had a paid employee</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.239" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">oh i love it so much else can be done</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.280" end="01:17:32.800" style="s2">yep we created a whole corporate</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:33.679" style="s2">structure even invented it actually from</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.800" end="01:17:36.000" style="s2">whole cloth</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.679" end="01:17:36.960" style="s2">which we call the council of guilds</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.000" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.960" end="01:17:40.560" style="s2">each of the working groups in the maker</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">space like woodworking metalworking</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.560" end="01:17:44.480" style="s2">pottery fiber art etc has their own</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:46.480" style="s2">guild</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.480" end="01:17:47.760" style="s2">and what would otherwise be called a</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.480" end="01:17:50.640" style="s2">board of directors</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.760" end="01:17:51.520" style="s2">is the council of guilds and the council</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.640" end="01:17:53.280" style="s2">of guilds</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.520" end="01:17:55.440" style="s2">approves new guilds coming in and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.280" end="01:17:57.280" style="s2">there&#39;s some machinery in the bylaws on</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.440" end="01:17:59.920" style="s2">what the minimum necessary</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">requirements are to start a guild etc</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.920" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2">and the guilds are responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:04.480" style="s2">keeping their area up to date you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">clean and safe and</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.480" end="01:18:09.440" style="s2">following all the rules and the council</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:10.800" style="s2">of guilds together allocates the capital</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.440" end="01:18:13.679" style="s2">from the membership fees</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.800" end="01:18:15.280" style="s2">back to the guilds and it&#39;s amazing and</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.679" end="01:18:16.239" style="s2">at first people elsewhere say oh you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.280" end="01:18:19.040" style="s2">never make it work</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.239" end="01:18:19.679" style="s2">without a paid executive director well</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.040" end="01:18:21.360" style="s2">guess what</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.679" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">i would say 75 percent of the maker</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.360" end="01:18:25.040" style="s2">spaces that started</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:26.640" style="s2">or were in business six years ago with</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.040" end="01:18:28.480" style="s2">paid staffer out of business</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.640" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">because the treadmill of fundraising</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.480" end="01:18:32.199" style="s2">just wore them down</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:33.520" style="s2">our thing which was relentlessly</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.199" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.520" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">self-directed self-governed and now with</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:40.159" style="s2">the council of guild self-managed</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:41.920" style="s2">still there and going strong in a town</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">that would seem to be way too small to</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.920" end="01:18:45.360" style="s2">support something like this</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.840" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">i would love to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.360" end="01:18:48.159" style="s2">borrowing that structure as we organize</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:50.159" style="s2">zebra&#39;s unite</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.159" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">i would love to learn from that yep i</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.159" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">often share the bylaws with people i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:54.480" style="s2">send you a link to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.960" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">really interesting and you know i</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.480" end="01:18:58.000" style="s2">advised around the edges of it two</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:00.000" style="s2">friends of mine megan williamson</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.000" end="01:19:01.120" style="s2">and dan funk are the ones who really</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.000" end="01:19:03.679" style="s2">cooked it up</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.120" end="01:19:06.000" style="s2">and it was kind of a cross between an</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.679" end="01:19:07.760" style="s2">anarchist and a medievalist right just</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.000" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">what you&#39;d expect the council of guilds</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.760" end="01:19:10.320" style="s2">came</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.440" style="s2">out the other side and my job was to</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.320" end="01:19:13.280" style="s2">keep them out of trouble</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.440" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">with the regulatory people we sure</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.280" end="01:19:17.520" style="s2">enough got it accepted by the virginia</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:18.640" style="s2">corporation council and more difficult</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.520" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">with the irs</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.640" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">not-for-profit thing has a 501c3 despite</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:25.440" style="s2">the fact that it has this</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:25.920" style="s2">very peculiar bylaws and that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.440" end="01:19:28.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.920" end="01:19:30.159" style="s2">concept that hey people it can be done</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.880" end="01:19:32.480" style="s2">it was a lot of work</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.159" end="01:19:34.159" style="s2">and we were lucky to have megan and dan</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.480" end="01:19:34.880" style="s2">be able to do that tremendous body of</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:36.719" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.880" end="01:19:39.120" style="s2">and we had a little bit of help from a</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.719" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">lawyer but not a lot i think we paid</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.120" end="01:19:42.400" style="s2">twenty five hundred dollars for all of</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.880" end="01:19:45.600" style="s2">our legal work was not bad</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">all the way through the 501c3 process</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.600" end="01:19:48.480" style="s2">don&#39;t give up just because you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">a structure that exists that</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.480" end="01:19:52.400" style="s2">accomplishes what you want</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:54.320" style="s2">as meda has done and as we did in the</p>

<p begin="01:19:54.320" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">invent the structures that you need</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.239" end="01:19:59.360" style="s2">right or at least don&#39;t give up until</p>

<p begin="01:19:59.360" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">within our system the one good thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">about it is it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">open to new formulations as long as you</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:10.560" style="s2">abide by just a few</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:11.920" style="s2">you know basic principles yep and i</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.560" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s where you know back to our</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.920" end="01:20:16.719" style="s2">earlier conversation</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:18.560" style="s2">of um capital you know what&#39;s useful and</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.719" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">when you were just recounting that story</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.560" end="01:20:23.360" style="s2">there is just this reality of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.040" end="01:20:25.920" style="s2">incorporation fees and lawyer fees</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.360" end="01:20:27.520" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s unfortunately some</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.920" end="01:20:30.000" style="s2">bureaucratic red tape</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.520" end="01:20:32.560" style="s2">um that&#39;s involved in the creation of</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.000" end="01:20:34.719" style="s2">these new structures where capital</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.560" end="01:20:36.560" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s just necessary to cross</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.719" end="01:20:38.320" style="s2">that bridge to get you to your gov you</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.560" end="01:20:39.440" style="s2">know your bylaws and your corporate</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.320" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">forms so</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.440" end="01:20:43.440" style="s2">until we have a library of those that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:44.800" style="s2">templatable and um</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.440" end="01:20:46.800" style="s2">you know i think the other big piece is</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.800" end="01:20:49.199" style="s2">just the education that founders have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.800" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">have about all of these systems and</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:53.040" style="s2">and structures as well um but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:54.800" style="s2">remarkable with just</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.040" end="01:20:56.159" style="s2">some creativity at that level what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.800" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.159" end="01:20:59.520" style="s2">yeah it sounds like you know we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:00.480" style="s2">similar kinds of things with different</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.520" end="01:21:02.239" style="s2">motivations</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.480" end="01:21:03.920" style="s2">one final question for you because we</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.239" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">are just about out of time</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">is how about the angel investing</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:09.280" style="s2">communities that</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">many communities have i&#39;m sure portland</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.280" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">must have a nice angel investing</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:13.120" style="s2">community we even have two different</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:16.000" style="s2">angel</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.120" end="01:21:17.600" style="s2">groups here in central virginia between</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.000" end="01:21:19.600" style="s2">them they&#39;ve probably put out</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.600" end="01:21:20.800" style="s2">more than 10 million dollars in</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.600" end="01:21:23.440" style="s2">investments</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.800" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">most of them under a million in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.440" end="01:21:27.040" style="s2">total investment</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">in any one round have you guys reached</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.040" end="01:21:31.600" style="s2">out to and tapped into the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:33.600" style="s2">angel communities where you live yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.600" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">oregon does have a pretty active angel</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.600" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:38.960" style="s2">um you know oregon venture fund which</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:42.000" style="s2">started as oregon angel fund and</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.960" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">cascade angels um there are a number of</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.000" end="01:21:45.120" style="s2">great thriving angel syndicates and</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.320" end="01:21:48.880" style="s2">others</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.120" end="01:21:50.639" style="s2">i think that for me what i&#39;ve seen at</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.880" end="01:21:52.880" style="s2">least with women and people of color who</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.639" end="01:21:55.679" style="s2">are seeking investment is that the angel</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.880" end="01:21:56.880" style="s2">and the investor has to be you know just</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.679" end="01:21:58.960" style="s2">in the same way that we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.880" end="01:22:02.000" style="s2">about the ideal community manager</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.960" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">you know and that archetype there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.000" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">really a role</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:06.239" style="s2">like there&#39;s i think being an angel is</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:10.000" style="s2">much harder than</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.239" end="01:22:12.400" style="s2">it uh seems or that it is right</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.000" end="01:22:14.400" style="s2">now because especially with</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.400" end="01:22:17.679" style="s2">underrepresented founders</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.400" end="01:22:20.960" style="s2">you have to approach them with care also</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.679" end="01:22:22.000" style="s2">and so um it probably means recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.960" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.000" end="01:22:25.120" style="s2">understanding of their lived experience</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:27.520" style="s2">when we did the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.120" end="01:22:29.600" style="s2">zebra survey the majority of our</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.520" end="01:22:31.120" style="s2">founders are first-time entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.600" end="01:22:33.280" style="s2">first-generation college students they</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.120" end="01:22:35.199" style="s2">were raised in a single-family home</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.280" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">they identify as you know a person of</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.199" end="01:22:39.600" style="s2">color or woman and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:41.360" style="s2">the dominant paradigm of angels is you</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.600" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">know they look a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.360" end="01:22:45.520" style="s2">um and so it means approaching a</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:47.520" style="s2">financing event with a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.520" end="01:22:49.360" style="s2">of humility and curiosity</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.520" end="01:22:50.719" style="s2">a lot of what i see with angels at least</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.360" end="01:22:53.360" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.719" end="01:22:54.960" style="s2">and my own lived experience is the the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.360" end="01:22:57.600" style="s2">encounter can be really</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.960" end="01:22:59.760" style="s2">violent to a dream um because the power</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.600" end="01:23:01.760" style="s2">dynamic is one in which that person</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.760" end="01:23:03.440" style="s2">can set themselves up to just think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.760" end="01:23:05.920" style="s2">they know more about the business</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.440" end="01:23:07.679" style="s2">so i had to have a lot of courage to</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.920" end="01:23:09.679" style="s2">listen to my inner wisdom to say like</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.679" end="01:23:12.159" style="s2">we&#39;re not growth hacking this</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.679" end="01:23:13.760" style="s2">with facebook ads and i met with a</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.159" end="01:23:16.159" style="s2">number of mentors that</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.760" end="01:23:18.239" style="s2">provided or a number of angel investors</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.159" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">that provided that type of advice so</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.239" end="01:23:21.520" style="s2">i suppose what i would say to founders</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:23.679" style="s2">is really listen to your intuition if</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.520" end="01:23:25.840" style="s2">you have a vibrant and</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.679" end="01:23:27.920" style="s2">humble and curious receptive community</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.840" end="01:23:30.000" style="s2">as it sounds like you do in virginia</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.920" end="01:23:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s open to new ways of thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.000" end="01:23:34.080" style="s2">that recognizes</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.440" end="01:23:35.360" style="s2">what true innovation looks like i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.080" end="01:23:36.320" style="s2">that can be a transformative</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:38.639" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.320" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">i think that there are other communities</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.639" end="01:23:43.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">continue to see it as a power dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.760" end="01:23:46.880" style="s2">of um you know telling founders what to</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:49.679" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.880" end="01:23:51.120" style="s2">and not as a role of a coach and so it</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.679" end="01:23:52.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit different so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.120" end="01:23:53.600" style="s2">know i don&#39;t know that&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.320" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">perception right now of the angel</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.600" end="01:23:57.360" style="s2">communities that i&#39;ve been around</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:23:59.360" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s certainly a valid</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.360" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">point but pretty much most of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.360" end="01:24:02.800" style="s2">angels are old white men that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.159" end="01:24:04.000" style="s2">it goes</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.800" end="01:24:06.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that those the people</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.000" end="01:24:07.840" style="s2">that dominated the game 30 years ago and</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.080" end="01:24:10.000" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that have the money now</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.840" end="01:24:11.040" style="s2">hopefully that will change over time but</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.000" end="01:24:13.360" style="s2">in the interim</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.040" end="01:24:15.120" style="s2">you know i think your point of there are</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.360" end="01:24:16.400" style="s2">definitely people out there that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.120" end="01:24:19.520" style="s2">open-minded</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.400" end="01:24:20.800" style="s2">and perhaps organizations like yours can</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.520" end="01:24:22.239" style="s2">do the sorting because you&#39;re right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.800" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2">highly stressful for the individual</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.239" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">entrepreneur particularly if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:27.440" style="s2">from an underrepresented</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:29.360" style="s2">group who doesn&#39;t you know have i guess</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.440" end="01:24:32.159" style="s2">you&#39;d call it implicit capital</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.360" end="01:24:33.679" style="s2">to turn implicit racism and implicit</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.159" end="01:24:36.159" style="s2">sexism on its head</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.679" end="01:24:38.080" style="s2">to act as an intermediary where you can</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.159" end="01:24:39.360" style="s2">because you guys do have track records</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.080" end="01:24:41.040" style="s2">and you do have</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.360" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">structure and you do have creative</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.040" end="01:24:44.560" style="s2">thinking you may be able to tap into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:45.840" style="s2">angels that the individuals can&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.560" end="01:24:48.080" style="s2">aggregate them</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.840" end="01:24:49.920" style="s2">yep so yeah and i think like i also</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.080" end="01:24:50.320" style="s2">think angel investing is a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.920" end="01:24:52.239" style="s2">ripe</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.320" end="01:24:54.159" style="s2">for reimagining you know i&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.239" end="01:24:56.320" style="s2">wondered why</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.159" end="01:24:57.760" style="s2">why if you have a hunch about someone</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.320" end="01:24:58.400" style="s2">instead of going through the song and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.760" end="01:25:00.880" style="s2">dance for</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.400" end="01:25:02.320" style="s2">you know fifty thousand dollar check</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.880" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">give them a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.320" end="01:25:05.360" style="s2">and ask them to report back in a week</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:06.400" style="s2">whether they are</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.360" end="01:25:07.920" style="s2">you know what they did with that</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.400" end="01:25:08.639" style="s2">thousand dollars did they acquire a</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.920" end="01:25:10.480" style="s2">customer</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.639" end="01:25:12.000" style="s2">or did they make a mistake that led to a</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.480" end="01:25:14.880" style="s2">lesson or were they able</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.000" end="01:25:16.080" style="s2">to hire who did they hire as a result of</p>
