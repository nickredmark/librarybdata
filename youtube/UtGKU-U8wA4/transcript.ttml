<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">but I can still gather data without that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">later I&#39;ll come in and say a goalie bot</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:19.379" style="s2">has an opinion and that&#39;s when people</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:21.660" style="s2">will stop all over him because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.379" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">it&#39;s only when you have opinions on</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.660" end="00:02:27.599" style="s2">Twitter that people stop you but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.879" style="s2">don&#39;t that&#39;ll be the engagement says oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.599" end="00:02:32.870" style="s2">I believe this and then I&#39;ll take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.879" end="00:02:37.260" style="s2">data and just repeat rinse and repeat</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.870" end="00:02:38.940" style="s2">and then today I&#39;m also since it deals</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.260" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">with debating stuff I&#39;m in a group</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.940" end="00:02:42.989" style="s2">called the canal debate lab and we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">to or the people join who have two other</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.989" end="00:02:51.510" style="s2">projects so there will be some progress</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">and in that area as people get to know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.510" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">and argue about arguing which is always</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:00.329" style="s2">fun that&#39;s so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:03.720" style="s2">progress and I guess if we&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.329" end="00:03:05.790" style="s2">full accountability which we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.720" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">said we&#39;re gonna do or not then if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.790" end="00:03:09.810" style="s2">you know sometimes you would also say</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:13.019" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to do next week so</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:16.799" style="s2">next week I will be or between now and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.019" end="00:03:22.139" style="s2">the next meeting I will be releasing the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.799" end="00:03:26.030" style="s2">new demo code and I hopefully will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.139" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">starting to generate some content and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.030" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">agile if you have any topics that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">think might be debatable or that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">like to see a structure debate on if</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">you&#39;d let me know and I&#39;ll see if those</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:44.190" style="s2">would fit into my initial set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:45.870" style="s2">experiments just yeah I mean my for wiki</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.190" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">election I&#39;m kind of taking the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.870" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">others you know think you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:51.060" style="s2">starting it like a simpler topic which</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:52.889" style="s2">makes sense I understand why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.060" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">doing that because I&#39;m sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.889" end="00:03:58.200" style="s2">get like just a barrage of evidence I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:02.450" style="s2">starting at like the top or I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.200" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">to climate change in vaccines so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.450" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">mean yeah I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:10.109" style="s2">to tackle those kind of topics yet but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">do want to stay smaller but if you run</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.109" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">across the one that you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.019" style="s2">tackle but you think would be nice then</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">okay know one of the ones that I might</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.019" end="00:04:20.820" style="s2">tackle to start with just to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:23.239" style="s2">keep it more light is flutter I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.820" end="00:04:23.239" style="s2">sure if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.910" end="00:04:32.580" style="s2">wait is this is the what again flutter</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.160" end="00:04:41.009" style="s2">or I guess flat the shape of being yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.580" end="00:04:41.009" style="s2">yes I have been thinking about that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">the other two have a debate yeah did</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.840" end="00:04:51.130" style="s2">heavy did you see the documentary that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:52.449" style="s2">came out a year or two ago with the they</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.130" end="00:04:54.850" style="s2">actually had someone flatter two-thirds</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.449" end="00:04:56.919" style="s2">participate in the documentary I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.850" end="00:04:59.139" style="s2">the documentary I saw some people review</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.919" end="00:05:01.000" style="s2">the documentary okay it was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.139" end="00:05:03.880" style="s2">fascinating and they did a really good</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.000" end="00:05:08.110" style="s2">job of being respectful of people you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.880" end="00:05:08.949" style="s2">would ordinarily dismiss so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.110" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">thought it was good</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.949" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">is there anything you need help with</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:15.789" style="s2">Bentley that&#39;s a good question I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:17.830" style="s2">know if anyone does have any opinion so</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.789" end="00:05:19.930" style="s2">the topic that I chose was just the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.830" end="00:05:23.410" style="s2">ketogenic way of eating or the keto diet</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:26.169" style="s2">so if anyone has any like when they hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.410" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">that what are the concerns that that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.169" end="00:05:29.590" style="s2">have like oh you know you&#39;re gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.720" style="s2">of a heart attack or stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.590" end="00:05:34.630" style="s2">it&#39;d be good to get a feeling for like</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.720" end="00:05:36.280" style="s2">your top three or four reasons why you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.630" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">might be scared if you heard a family</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.280" end="00:05:42.729" style="s2">member was going to do that or something</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:46.030" style="s2">like that or you know if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.729" end="00:05:49.300" style="s2">die-hard Quito person like I am then why</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.030" end="00:05:52.120" style="s2">you think it works but yeah any topics</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:53.710" style="s2">on a and just to go on Twitter and look</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.120" end="00:05:56.500" style="s2">up gully bots and I can give you a link</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.710" end="00:05:58.210" style="s2">and and post there so that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.500" end="00:06:00.070" style="s2">see it if you if you want to be private</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.210" end="00:06:03.490" style="s2">you can always message it to me and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.070" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">use the data though cool so yeah another</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.490" end="00:06:08.050" style="s2">topic which type information I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:09.430" style="s2">sure accessible it is is I mean either</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.050" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">go broad and go breathe Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.430" end="00:06:14.199" style="s2">legislation or just we simply talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.110" end="00:06:17.110" style="s2">pit bulls and sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.199" end="00:06:18.280" style="s2">controversy there there&#39;s yeah that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:20.470" style="s2">interesting one because you could just</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.280" end="00:06:24.030" style="s2">do you know our certain dog breeds more</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.470" end="00:06:26.770" style="s2">aggressive than others where people deny</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.030" end="00:06:28.030" style="s2">or there&#39;s the nuance of saying a whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:29.620" style="s2">breed could be but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.030" end="00:06:31.340" style="s2">necessarily apply to a specific dog</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.620" end="00:06:35.590" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.340" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">then but I think for my system a a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.590" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">specific piece of legislation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.870" style="s2">would be ideal right okay because it</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.729" end="00:06:49.880" style="s2">talking about too long I think a couple</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.350" end="00:06:51.500" style="s2">of cities have recently started to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.880" end="00:06:52.550" style="s2">repeal them because they&#39;ve gone back</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.500" end="00:06:54.229" style="s2">interviewed and said this didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.520" end="00:07:14.180" style="s2">that honestly I&#39;ll probably keep away</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:15.620" style="s2">from election cuz it&#39;s a bit too close</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.180" end="00:07:20.870" style="s2">to me so I don&#39;t think that I could be</p>

<p begin="00:08:40.099" end="00:08:43.099" style="s2">on the fourth topic news I found out</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.959" end="00:08:45.890" style="s2">it&#39;s really just the same as the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.099" end="00:08:47.510" style="s2">one which is sort of the core feature</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.890" end="00:08:50.750" style="s2">because the news feature sort of comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.510" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">out of those so really this next session</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.750" end="00:08:54.770" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna be doing in just under</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.190" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">is the right word but throw it into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.280" end="00:09:17.780" style="s2">ether of the Internet and see what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:20.780" style="s2">happens I guess that&#39;s not what</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.200" end="00:09:45.920" style="s2">I have to wait for that to come in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:47.740" style="s2">mail for the new one which is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:51.710" style="s2">something I expected to hold it up but</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.710" end="00:09:56.630" style="s2">I think that&#39;s about it for now and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.520" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">quick tip if you want to try it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.630" end="00:10:01.430" style="s2">oftentimes you can just figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:04.010" style="s2">the next date would be and put it in yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.430" end="00:10:05.720" style="s2">and it all work I know that because some</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.010" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">startups have started automatically</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.720" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">rolling your dates that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:13.220" style="s2">feature that some of those will talk to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.990" style="s2">the banking company and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.220" end="00:10:17.030" style="s2">something in a lot of the terms on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.990" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">credit card that said just go it if a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.030" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">company is paying for this service</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.520" style="s2">because they sometimes it&#39;s not even the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:24.200" style="s2">same card number they just get like your</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.520" end="00:10:26.090" style="s2">new card number and expiry and all that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.200" end="00:10:28.360" style="s2">information if they had the previous one</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.090" end="00:10:31.280" style="s2">and they&#39;re paying for a certain service</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.360" end="00:10:34.730" style="s2">but yeah anything you want help with</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.280" end="00:10:37.550" style="s2">during the during the hour um I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.730" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">I am looking for anyone that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.550" end="00:10:43.370" style="s2">sort of attend as another talking head</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:44.960" style="s2">in the election sessions because you</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.370" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">know if it&#39;s not that it&#39;s just me</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.960" end="00:10:49.340" style="s2">talking and that&#39;s not as interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:52.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve done like really five or six</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.340" end="00:10:54.080" style="s2">sessions now and the best one by far was</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.280" end="00:10:56.030" style="s2">the one where Edward cake came in and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.080" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">was the topic on science and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.030" end="00:10:59.690" style="s2">about that and it was great it was well</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:02.690" style="s2">longer than normal but we covered a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.690" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">of good stuff so what&#39;s your next topic</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.690" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">because you are doing them kind of by</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:08.450" style="s2">topic right yeah so now so basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:10.280" style="s2">starting today I&#39;m doing news and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.450" end="00:11:12.410" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna cycle through the same three</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.280" end="00:11:14.330" style="s2">topics sort of you know to covering one</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.410" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">every two weeks so it&#39;s news politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.330" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">and science and it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:20.120" style="s2">umbrella features around those and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:21.620" style="s2">whenever did it we kind of ended up</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.120" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">talking about the whole thing because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.620" end="00:11:26.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that much about it but we</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:27.860" style="s2">sort of used sought the like discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.390" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">of science as the entry point and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.860" end="00:11:31.400" style="s2">was actually quite good because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:33.490" style="s2">scientist has that background and he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.400" end="00:11:36.740" style="s2">able to come at it from that way and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.490" end="00:11:39.980" style="s2">when are you doing him again so I I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.740" end="00:11:41.990" style="s2">them on Saturdays at noon pacific and so</p>

<p begin="00:11:41.990" end="00:11:46.220" style="s2">in two weeks in two weeks in two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.330" end="00:11:50.980" style="s2">okay yeah i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.220" end="00:11:53.660" style="s2">of joining you on one of those okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.980" end="00:11:55.670" style="s2">sometime sounds good there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.660" end="00:12:01.010" style="s2">topic of those three that like speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.670" end="00:12:05.330" style="s2">you more i be nice so yeah either yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.010" end="00:12:08.900" style="s2">guess either the politics or the science</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.330" end="00:12:12.820" style="s2">maybe the science but politics or</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.900" end="00:12:17.540" style="s2">science the news one i&#39;m a little less i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.820" end="00:12:19.250" style="s2">think we need to judge the news but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:21.320" style="s2">i guess i can&#39;t really talk to them all</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.250" end="00:12:22.970" style="s2">but yeah yeah i mean it ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.320" end="00:12:24.050" style="s2">the same conversation sort of in the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.970" end="00:12:26.630" style="s2">cuz it&#39;s all about the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.050" end="00:12:28.910" style="s2">evidence and what it supports on the top</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.630" end="00:12:30.830" style="s2">end but it&#39;s yeah kind of get in and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.910" end="00:12:32.690" style="s2">would want you to get I don&#39;t seemed</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.830" end="00:12:34.340" style="s2">like you do have some content I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.690" end="00:12:36.410" style="s2">know if that&#39;s in case no one joins you</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.340" end="00:12:37.550" style="s2">or if you do have a set of features that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.410" end="00:12:40.250" style="s2">you want to go through over the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.550" end="00:12:41.930" style="s2">several months that sort of how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.250" end="00:12:43.850" style="s2">arranging it is each of those three</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.930" end="00:12:46.400" style="s2">topics is to cover the features for that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.850" end="00:12:49.640" style="s2">area I was splitting them out like</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.400" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">really sort of modular like talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.640" end="00:12:52.940" style="s2">developer style and then as I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:54.620" style="s2">talking about it I&#39;m like this just</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.940" end="00:12:56.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t resonate with people I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.620" end="00:12:58.130" style="s2">like it&#39;s too it&#39;s too technical so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.510" end="00:12:59.780" style="s2">started to loop it into like the really</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.130" end="00:13:03.260" style="s2">high level modules and sort of what kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.780" end="00:13:05.570" style="s2">of area of information these features</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.260" end="00:13:08.120" style="s2">should hopefully fix there is some</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.570" end="00:13:11.210" style="s2">overlap between them which is where it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.120" end="00:13:15.380" style="s2">gets a little bit murky but that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.210" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">cool so I can update you on what I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:13:51.140" end="00:13:54.620" style="s2">little dicey you never know what what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.000" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get but he was that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.620" end="00:13:59.870" style="s2">seemed to be a someone from from Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:01.880" style="s2">who who is interested in doing what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.870" end="00:14:03.170" style="s2">gonna be doing this next week was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.880" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">gonna reach out to Kiera because she</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.170" end="00:14:06.920" style="s2">said that she was interested in doing a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">solution raising on mental health</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.920" end="00:14:10.270" style="s2">emotional health</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">ensuring dream Kovach 19 especially and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.270" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">so I would love snood solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:16.400" style="s2">on that and if she&#39;s willing to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:18.020" style="s2">live jury in that hour that would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.400" end="00:14:19.700" style="s2">ideal because then people can showcase</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.020" end="00:14:21.260" style="s2">what that what that looks like it also</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.700" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">means it&#39;s a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.260" end="00:14:26.540" style="s2">assertion ratings are on this website</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">this YouTube channel and then my live</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.540" end="00:14:30.860" style="s2">broadcasts every hour on on the Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:33.800" style="s2">saves the world Channel</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.860" end="00:14:35.500" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s different like it&#39;s ill but</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.800" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">the point is is to just focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.500" end="00:14:41.090" style="s2">something for those hours and to see now</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:43.460" style="s2">can we have more of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.090" end="00:14:45.290" style="s2">conversation so possibly try it at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.460" end="00:14:48.140" style="s2">one of those throughout the seven days</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.290" end="00:14:50.570" style="s2">to be a live solution raising and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.140" end="00:14:54.980" style="s2">that one the first one will be on on</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.570" end="00:14:57.860" style="s2">mental health and what I would love help</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.980" end="00:15:01.910" style="s2">with if somebody has a solution in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.860" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">I guess just how to to grow the audience</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.910" end="00:15:07.460" style="s2">and what a toll and I talked to a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:10.250" style="s2">yesterday after our our board meeting of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.460" end="00:15:12.050" style="s2">like um what does this look like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.250" end="00:15:13.820" style="s2">it&#39;s different it&#39;s like a process</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.050" end="00:15:14.960" style="s2">raising as opposed to a solution a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.820" end="00:15:16.130" style="s2">solution or a saying is like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.960" end="00:15:17.960" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.130" end="00:15:20.570" style="s2">really looking for is a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.960" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">who want to focus on the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.570" end="00:15:22.690" style="s2">about a conversation that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:24.250" style="s2">wanting</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.690" end="00:15:25.990" style="s2">that&#39;s right like what is the process</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.250" end="00:15:29.350" style="s2">look like how can we create it from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.990" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">ground up of what would it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.350" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">create something with 10,000 people even</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:35.050" style="s2">though of course the actual core group</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:37.389" style="s2">of people who are creating it or 5 to 10</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.050" end="00:15:39.009" style="s2">people how do we create something with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.389" end="00:15:40.269" style="s2">hundred people in zoom and then with a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.009" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">hundred people and zoom how to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.269" end="00:15:43.870" style="s2">something for a thousand people and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:45.220" style="s2">for a thousand people how do we how does</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.870" end="00:15:47.649" style="s2">everyone invite ten people and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.220" end="00:15:50.680" style="s2">process will still work and so working</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.649" end="00:15:52.120" style="s2">through that is going to be messy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.680" end="00:15:54.329" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna try new things and someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.120" end="00:15:56.740" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s comfortable doing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.329" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">solution racing&#39;s itself don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.740" end="00:16:00.009" style="s2">be live on camera they can be on zoom we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:01.329" style="s2">can be doing it in a way that people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.009" end="00:16:03.490" style="s2">more comfortable but the meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.329" end="00:16:05.170" style="s2">conversation of the process raisi and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.490" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">like what does this look like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.170" end="00:16:08.319" style="s2">creating it for humanity how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:11.649" style="s2">ten thousand people involved I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.319" end="00:16:14.350" style="s2">that one does need to be live recorded</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.649" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">for everyone so that is what I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.350" end="00:16:17.860" style="s2">love is help on how do I find those</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">people or do I just keep doing it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.860" end="00:16:24.699" style="s2">doing and any thoughts any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:26.170" style="s2">that I need feedback on that so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.699" end="00:16:28.509" style="s2">done with the beginning part of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.170" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">this where we update everyone I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.350" end="00:16:38.769" style="s2">small thing because it&#39;s not really my</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.910" end="00:16:42.189" style="s2">project but there&#39;s something to work on</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.769" end="00:16:44.439" style="s2">I have a prototype for like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.189" end="00:16:47.319" style="s2">together Tech game B project sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.439" end="00:16:49.750" style="s2">like a group portal I sent the login</p>

<p begin="00:17:02.529" end="00:17:07.030" style="s2">imported them only a couple are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.929" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">visible on the public side cuz once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.030" end="00:17:11.159" style="s2">done testing I wanna be able to contact</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:14.289" style="s2">those people and say do you want it live</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.159" end="00:17:16.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s meant to be sort of like a hey</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.289" end="00:17:17.589" style="s2">anybody can go there and see what</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.000" end="00:17:19.780" style="s2">projects are listed what the projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.589" end="00:17:21.819" style="s2">need help with and want sort of events</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.780" end="00:17:23.530" style="s2">people are planning and then if you log</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.819" end="00:17:25.299" style="s2">in you can sign up for events and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.530" end="00:17:26.890" style="s2">know submit a project and ask the help</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.299" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">for the project and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.890" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">so I&#39;m probably you don&#39;t send it out to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.840" style="s2">you you Bentley and then at some point</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.039" end="00:17:35.710" style="s2">if other people that have projects or</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.840" end="00:17:37.810" style="s2">that want to help</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.710" end="00:17:41.350" style="s2">we&#39;re projects are interested in trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.810" end="00:17:43.990" style="s2">it out we can start sort of a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.350" end="00:17:45.370" style="s2">closed beta or probably closed alpha is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.990" end="00:17:55.030" style="s2">a better thing because it&#39;s still pretty</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">early yes yeah that sounds good so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.030" end="00:18:00.520" style="s2">would normally the process that we kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:04.560" style="s2">of talked about for these meetings was</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.520" end="00:18:06.730" style="s2">called the hot seat version of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.560" end="00:18:08.140" style="s2">mastermind which normally then you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.730" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">we do that little round at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.140" end="00:18:11.590" style="s2">or people talk about what they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:12.820" style="s2">what they&#39;ve done since the last meeting</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.590" end="00:18:16.450" style="s2">what they&#39;re gonna do for the next</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.820" end="00:18:19.170" style="s2">meeting if they want and you know any</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.450" end="00:18:22.750" style="s2">any things that they could use help on</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.170" end="00:18:26.320" style="s2">and then usually it&#39;s the way that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.750" end="00:18:28.420" style="s2">process was you choose someone that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.320" end="00:18:30.040" style="s2">would then that we&#39;ve been focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.420" end="00:18:31.540" style="s2">their specific needs and of course if</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.040" end="00:18:35.470" style="s2">you have time you know it could be more</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.540" end="00:18:41.110" style="s2">than one person I don&#39;t think we chose</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.470" end="00:18:43.930" style="s2">who would be this week powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.110" end="00:18:46.120" style="s2">for their project a bit I already got a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.930" end="00:18:48.040" style="s2">little feedback and I gave Adria little</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.120" end="00:18:50.410" style="s2">feedback so I don&#39;t know Ghibli a few</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.040" end="00:18:52.300" style="s2">before we want to focus on I&#39;m done with</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.410" end="00:18:55.300" style="s2">that I also think that possibly Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.300" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">if you want help with like more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.300" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">like what your project is write a name</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:01.570" style="s2">for it something like that so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:03.610" style="s2">leave it up to Shiloh whether she</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.570" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">whether that it&#39;s something you want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.610" end="00:19:10.540" style="s2">be in the hot seat or whether you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">to not be long um I think I think I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.540" end="00:19:14.770" style="s2">wait I&#39;m still just kind of like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">been thinking about this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.770" end="00:19:20.290" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know exactly what I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:23.830" style="s2">for yet or so I&#39;ll probably just wait I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.290" end="00:19:26.140" style="s2">am um I&#39;m still trying to figure out all</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.830" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">the different things even just how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.140" end="00:19:30.340" style="s2">get here today I had those like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.570" end="00:19:32.500" style="s2">received a message on my phone but then</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.340" end="00:19:34.450" style="s2">I had to turn around and realize oh I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.500" end="00:19:36.670" style="s2">need to email it to myself it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.450" end="00:19:38.800" style="s2">silly I&#39;m like totally behind on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.670" end="00:19:43.540" style="s2">tech and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever catch up</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.800" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">so but I am interested on all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.540" end="00:19:49.150" style="s2">things I listen to part of yesterday&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:51.400" style="s2">video on when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.150" end="00:19:55.270" style="s2">the keto diet and Bentley is that part</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.400" end="00:19:59.410" style="s2">of your project like yeah so well my</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.270" end="00:20:03.340" style="s2">part is to debate have effective debates</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.410" end="00:20:05.860" style="s2">on controversial topics and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.340" end="00:20:09.180" style="s2">kind of a small one that I chose for my</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.860" end="00:20:11.170" style="s2">first topic but so the the project isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.180" end="00:20:13.690" style="s2">actually aligned with that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.170" end="00:20:16.690" style="s2">our topic and then I might do pit bulls</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.690" end="00:20:18.340" style="s2">next like that trail suggesting but do</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.690" end="00:20:20.860" style="s2">you have a place where I can go and like</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.340" end="00:20:24.910" style="s2">listen to your conversation about it or</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.860" end="00:20:29.740" style="s2">is it just text it&#39;s gonna be on text</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.910" end="00:20:32.440" style="s2">base and right now I just there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.740" end="00:20:34.330" style="s2">location yet so all right now I just</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.440" end="00:20:36.520" style="s2">kind of posted the question on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.330" end="00:20:37.900" style="s2">and then I&#39;m gonna take when people give</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.520" end="00:20:41.140" style="s2">and then I&#39;m gonna put it into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.900" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">system so right now it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.140" end="00:20:44.140" style="s2">gonna be mature enough that people can</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.580" end="00:20:48.370" style="s2">actually just go on and start entering</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.140" end="00:20:49.570" style="s2">data so my thought is I&#39;ll collect the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.370" end="00:20:51.309" style="s2">data then I&#39;ll throw it back out to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.570" end="00:20:53.830" style="s2">Twitter and collect the data in and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.309" end="00:20:56.770" style="s2">Facebook so yeah I&#39;ll have a link</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.830" end="00:20:58.390" style="s2">hopefully in a week or so where it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.770" end="00:21:00.250" style="s2">kind of the first things that goalie</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.390" end="00:21:05.220" style="s2">bought which is the character has</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.250" end="00:21:09.870" style="s2">learned so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the plan</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.220" end="00:21:12.790" style="s2">and goalie bot is the name of your life</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.870" end="00:21:15.550" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s kind of the moderator the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.790" end="00:21:18.520" style="s2">character that will be taking watching</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.550" end="00:21:22.480" style="s2">everyone&#39;s conversations it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.520" end="00:21:24.550" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a moderator on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.480" end="00:21:28.690" style="s2">conversation that that has no</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.550" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">preconceived notions and the technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.690" end="00:21:34.150" style="s2">itself underlying it I&#39;ve called reasons</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.460" end="00:21:36.490" style="s2">score but now I&#39;m starting to realize</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.150" end="00:21:38.800" style="s2">that a numerical score confuses people</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.490" end="00:21:40.540" style="s2">and so maybe goalie bought would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.800" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">better so those are the two things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.540" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">the technology and then kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.990" style="s2">character of it quite so I&#39;m trying out</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:48.370" style="s2">several things to see what works I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.990" end="00:21:55.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going to hit</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.370" end="00:21:58.179" style="s2">yet yeah so yeah I&#39;d appreciate either</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.540" end="00:22:00.999" style="s2">if you want to give feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.179" end="00:22:03.879" style="s2">on Twitter so that people see it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.999" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">know and I could do like no yeah what do</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.879" end="00:22:07.779" style="s2">Twitter it&#39;s just like human me I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:12.579" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not going to go there via</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.779" end="00:22:13.149" style="s2">Facebook I&#39;m so limited like okay hardly</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.579" end="00:22:16.569" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.149" end="00:22:18.819" style="s2">I know yeah I&#39;m thinking at some point</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.569" end="00:22:22.659" style="s2">in the future when it gets a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.819" end="00:22:23.979" style="s2">more mature I will have videos and kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.659" end="00:22:27.729" style="s2">of like we&#39;re discussing yesterday a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.979" end="00:22:34.869" style="s2">very ungainly like thing whereas there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.729" end="00:22:37.269" style="s2">actually a game show type of using the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.869" end="00:22:38.979" style="s2">tech although technically I just I just</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.269" end="00:22:40.899" style="s2">remembered in the game show thing you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.979" end="00:22:43.299" style="s2">get points for getting for putting in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.899" end="00:22:45.249" style="s2">good information regardless of which</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.299" end="00:22:47.709" style="s2">side it&#39;s on so technically it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.249" end="00:22:50.079" style="s2">collaborative and just having it be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.709" end="00:22:51.459" style="s2">game show and debate is just to get all</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.079" end="00:22:54.699" style="s2">the people that are used to game a to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.459" end="00:22:57.849" style="s2">watch it but it is kind of pushed</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.699" end="00:22:59.109" style="s2">towards the game be space anyway so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.849" end="00:23:02.439" style="s2">at some point in the future I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.109" end="00:23:03.909" style="s2">have some kind of content and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.439" end="00:23:05.199" style="s2">talked to my brother this morning about</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.909" end="00:23:09.669" style="s2">maybe he and I should come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.199" end="00:23:11.139" style="s2">topic to debate but whoever does it it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.669" end="00:23:13.569" style="s2">would be really really slow cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.139" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">like let&#39;s decide on a point and type it</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.569" end="00:23:19.569" style="s2">in so I&#39;d have to kind of edit the video</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:22.599" style="s2">down to be less boring so he owes me a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.569" end="00:23:25.089" style="s2">favor so he might do that with that with</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.599" end="00:23:28.659" style="s2">gully bot like if I respond to to it on</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.089" end="00:23:31.719" style="s2">Twitter do I need to pro and con</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.659" end="00:23:33.879" style="s2">separately gonna be like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.719" end="00:23:35.589" style="s2">know it&#39;s not sustainable for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.879" end="00:23:37.299" style="s2">on the planet to do it but it helps with</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.589" end="00:23:39.279" style="s2">individual&#39;s health you absolutely need</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.299" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">it right that&#39;s gonna be like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.279" end="00:23:43.539" style="s2">need to it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:45.639" style="s2">just manual we&#39;re all gonna be taking it</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.539" end="00:23:47.769" style="s2">in and putting it in it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.639" end="00:23:50.679" style="s2">communication device outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.769" end="00:23:52.419" style="s2">system I built take to have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.679" end="00:23:55.239" style="s2">conversation where people are interested</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.419" end="00:23:56.619" style="s2">so yeah so however you want to I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.239" end="00:24:00.039" style="s2">it would be interesting to see in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.619" end="00:24:01.989" style="s2">pro/con format dalvik yeah I see so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.039" end="00:24:03.219" style="s2">still in like The Wizard of Oz prototype</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.989" end="00:24:05.889" style="s2">style where there&#39;s still the man behind</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.219" end="00:24:07.089" style="s2">the curtain it&#39;s just ya helper yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.889" end="00:24:09.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.089" end="00:24:11.710" style="s2">always be moderate well so this first</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.489" end="00:24:14.429" style="s2">phase is a highly moderated one so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:18.820" style="s2">everything will kind of go through me so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.429" end="00:24:21.940" style="s2">the goal isn&#39;t really to have a debate</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.820" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">system it but it is to have a resource</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.940" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">that has everyone&#39;s concerns in an</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.220" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">organized format right the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:34.299" style="s2">so it&#39;s really gonna be like a a fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:36.669" style="s2">check website with a lot of more input</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.299" end="00:24:42.820" style="s2">from other people but still not direct</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.669" end="00:24:44.380" style="s2">input yet because when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.820" end="00:24:47.260" style="s2">about kaliba remember when I saw it I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.380" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">was confused about how it was recent</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.260" end="00:24:50.260" style="s2">score and I was like I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:52.059" style="s2">how this is a heading because if reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.260" end="00:24:56.919" style="s2">score and I didn&#39;t know how to interact</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.059" end="00:25:00.039" style="s2">with it so I didn&#39;t know and other</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.919" end="00:25:02.289" style="s2">people that might be something the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.039" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">reason it&#39;s not getting feedback is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.289" end="00:25:05.710" style="s2">one people don&#39;t know what it is even</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:08.470" style="s2">though it&#39;s a kilo robot and so having</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.710" end="00:25:09.700" style="s2">more people participate with that right</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.470" end="00:25:12.100" style="s2">of like here&#39;s how you actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.700" end="00:25:13.510" style="s2">participate so it was like I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.970" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">harder to not do I do</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.170" end="00:26:14.230" style="s2">I guess I have another quick question</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.160" end="00:26:16.150" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering so Bentley you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.230" end="00:26:20.050" style="s2">developer and Adriel are you also a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.150" end="00:26:22.150" style="s2">developer I&#39;m not a developer I work</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.050" end="00:26:25.060" style="s2">with developers but I&#39;m not a developer</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.150" end="00:26:27.700" style="s2">myself okay and my question is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.060" end="00:26:30.850" style="s2">Bentley are you doing any developing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.700" end="00:26:34.440" style="s2">with hollow chamber no wait I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.850" end="00:26:38.980" style="s2">developing in what Halloween Hollow</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.440" end="00:26:42.330" style="s2">all the way I don&#39;t know gene Oh on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.980" end="00:26:42.330" style="s2">hollow chain stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.850" end="00:26:49.810" style="s2">no but I&#39;m open to using that as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.590" end="00:26:53.650" style="s2">base database technology for any of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.810" end="00:26:55.870" style="s2">tools I want that I&#39;m building another</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.650" end="00:26:59.560" style="s2">kind of database system similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.870" end="00:27:01.000" style="s2">is gun so that that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.560" end="00:27:03.580" style="s2">options that&#39;s using a hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.000" end="00:27:08.590" style="s2">although my preference would actually be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.580" end="00:27:10.510" style="s2">hash graph which is yeah we could get</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.590" end="00:27:12.370" style="s2">into the debate on reason why to use one</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.510" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">or not but but yeah some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.370" end="00:27:21.280" style="s2">blockchain technology I&#39;m useful maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:26.050" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit is when I think of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.280" end="00:27:30.310" style="s2">hollow chain I think of it as like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.050" end="00:27:33.040" style="s2">seems to be easier mapping data and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.310" end="00:27:35.530" style="s2">connections where is blockchain is more</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.040" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">like a centralized I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.530" end="00:27:39.450" style="s2">decentralized in a way but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:43.810" style="s2">kind of one central ledger is that right</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.450" end="00:27:45.990" style="s2">what it was to be centralized controller</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.810" end="00:27:52.090" style="s2">register</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.990" end="00:27:53.950" style="s2">I thought hollow chain was I know I read</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.090" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">it it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.950" end="00:28:00.610" style="s2">at it oh yeah yeah control your identity</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:02.560" style="s2">yeah yeah and so hollow chain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.610" end="00:28:06.030" style="s2">helps is that&#39;s similar to the gun</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.560" end="00:28:10.540" style="s2">database where you kind of have your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.030" end="00:28:12.040" style="s2">collection of the data yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.540" end="00:28:13.690" style="s2">yeah so I haven&#39;t used it specifically</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.040" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">but it&#39;s on my list of technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.690" end="00:28:17.789" style="s2">consider</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:20.919" style="s2">right now I&#39;m using more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.789" end="00:28:24.429" style="s2">database but I&#39;m creating the system to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.919" end="00:28:30.570" style="s2">where you can easily move it on to any</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.429" end="00:28:33.220" style="s2">sort of back-end well let me know if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.570" end="00:28:37.450" style="s2">do any research on it and I do have some</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.220" end="00:28:40.980" style="s2">ideas about the thing that we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.450" end="00:28:43.570" style="s2">to create that ghost that uses that type</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.980" end="00:28:45.669" style="s2">just because it has a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.570" end="00:28:47.350" style="s2">tracking mechanism I guess you&#39;d say and</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.669" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">everybody can have their own yet I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.350" end="00:28:53.970" style="s2">believe we can mark to deposit it right</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:57.429" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s probably really out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.970" end="00:28:59.049" style="s2">another time yeah yeah and definitely if</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.429" end="00:29:04.169" style="s2">you want to have a chat about it we</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.049" end="00:29:04.169" style="s2">could always schedule meeting and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.470" end="00:29:12.669" style="s2">right I can take the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.789" end="00:29:15.700" style="s2">everywhere I hope that so umm I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.669" end="00:29:17.080" style="s2">what I would what I most want is well</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.700" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">there&#39;s two things one of which is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.080" end="00:29:20.379" style="s2">figure out kind of what that hour in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:22.059" style="s2">morning looks like although I&#39;m a kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.379" end="00:29:24.129" style="s2">of okay with letting it evolve and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.059" end="00:29:26.259" style="s2">try new things and see what&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.129" end="00:29:29.080" style="s2">really just being in the seat on camera</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.259" end="00:29:31.029" style="s2">for an hour and see how that evolves and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.080" end="00:29:33.159" style="s2">and growing an audience both for my</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.029" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">channel but also for just projects in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.159" end="00:29:40.870" style="s2">general but what I would love is for</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:42.580" style="s2">that hour to actually be have it leads</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.870" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">somewhere have it be something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.580" end="00:29:45.700" style="s2">kind of like a solution or easy like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:48.429" style="s2">said doing live solution radians but</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.700" end="00:29:51.009" style="s2">what I would having a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.429" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">who are focused on how can we create the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.009" end="00:29:55.000" style="s2">process for solution raising so that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:56.830" style="s2">it solution raising is a specific type</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.000" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">of conversation that gets the spark of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.830" end="00:30:00.639" style="s2">the idea from the group it&#39;s pretty easy</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:03.340" style="s2">to extrapolate that into a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.639" end="00:30:05.080" style="s2">people on zoom&#39; but it&#39;s but then we</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.340" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">just have the spark of an idea I want</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.080" end="00:30:08.769" style="s2">people who want to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:10.659" style="s2">on how do we actually get 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.769" end="00:30:14.740" style="s2">how do we get a process with a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.659" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">people how do we what what and have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.740" end="00:30:17.379" style="s2">conversation live on cameras of other</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:19.990" style="s2">people who don&#39;t want to be on camera</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.379" end="00:30:21.370" style="s2">can contribute to yes I would want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.990" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">one of the 10,000 but I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.370" end="00:30:25.450" style="s2">one of the people on camera like to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:28.419" style="s2">a better understanding and so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.450" end="00:30:30.830" style="s2">lot of things I realized but</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.419" end="00:30:33.130" style="s2">pie-in-the-sky would really love to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">four to five other people to meet with I</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.130" end="00:30:37.820" style="s2">realize every day for people right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:41.779" style="s2">8:30 to 9:30 would be a lot so having</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.820" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">that stay kind of like the journey</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.779" end="00:30:44.330" style="s2">Occupy movement when they had two</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:45.980" style="s2">meetings a day you didn&#39;t really need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.330" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">attend them because they reiterated what</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.980" end="00:30:49.580" style="s2">was happening in the last one have it be</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">something that people don&#39;t need to show</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.580" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">up for consistently and it&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:30:55.730" style="s2">things are diabolically opposed just</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:57.799" style="s2">like to have people just show up and do</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.730" end="00:30:58.970" style="s2">a project raising and they can show up</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.799" end="00:31:01.190" style="s2">and do money for that day they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.970" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">need to have a movie for it so possibly</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.190" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">even just picking one day a week that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:06.980" style="s2">focused on the more meta this is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.990" style="s2">this is kind of like what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:11.059" style="s2">with together tech on Fridays but doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.990" end="00:31:13.429" style="s2">it for project raising and happy people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.059" end="00:31:15.350" style="s2">who want to participate once a week but</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.429" end="00:31:21.820" style="s2">you know 8:30 to have the more Matt the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.350" end="00:31:25.159" style="s2">conversation so ideas thoughts clarity I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.820" end="00:31:28.519" style="s2">mean kind of a small simple one for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.159" end="00:31:29.899" style="s2">like being able to you know or being</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.519" end="00:31:32.710" style="s2">able to miss them and not having to</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.899" end="00:31:35.539" style="s2">attend every one I kind of had the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.710" end="00:31:36.889" style="s2">issue with the last reams for kwikki</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.539" end="00:31:38.809" style="s2">election and one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.889" end="00:31:40.549" style="s2">might end up doing is having sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.809" end="00:31:41.809" style="s2">like a templated like here&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.549" end="00:31:43.340" style="s2">know spiel that I do in the first two</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.809" end="00:31:45.710" style="s2">minutes or five minutes or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.340" end="00:31:46.940" style="s2">is and then after it&#39;s posted on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.710" end="00:31:47.960" style="s2">you can go in there and add a comment</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.940" end="00:31:50.779" style="s2">and saying look if you want to skip the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.960" end="00:31:52.460" style="s2">spiel click here because most people are</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.779" end="00:31:53.779" style="s2">going to be watching it either not live</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.460" end="00:31:55.580" style="s2">so if you&#39;re not attending in the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.779" end="00:31:57.289" style="s2">two or five minutes you&#39;ll miss it which</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.580" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">I guess in this case is probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.289" end="00:31:59.960" style="s2">thing and then if you&#39;re watching it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">live and you&#39;ve watched you know three</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.960" end="00:32:03.049" style="s2">in a row and you&#39;re like I get it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:05.480" style="s2">can click to skip it and you just go</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.049" end="00:32:07.909" style="s2">into the meat and potatoes of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.480" end="00:32:09.409" style="s2">conversation I can ask you more is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.909" end="00:32:11.090" style="s2">just a link in the description it says</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.409" end="00:32:12.529" style="s2">start at three minutes and then it</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.090" end="00:32:14.870" style="s2">starts at three minutes or is there an</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.529" end="00:32:16.519" style="s2">actually an option to skip ahead I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.870" end="00:32:18.380" style="s2">the easiest thing would probably be in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.519" end="00:32:21.470" style="s2">the description I haven&#39;t played with</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.380" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">adding like the YouTube tiles that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.470" end="00:32:25.340" style="s2">you&#39;ll see in videos I&#39;m not sure if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:29.659" style="s2">can do those on unlike recorded live</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.340" end="00:32:32.840" style="s2">videos my guess is you probably can yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.659" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">I think you can and then edit any live</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.840" end="00:32:38.029" style="s2">video and make it right last my slide</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.559" style="s2">right yeah so I&#39;m assuming that all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.029" end="00:32:41.520" style="s2">same features are available yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.559" end="00:32:43.110" style="s2">could use that like the hotel</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.520" end="00:32:44.730" style="s2">but click you&#39;re good I believe you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.110" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">use that to skip two parts in the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.730" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">video but worst case yeah you can just</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:50.850" style="s2">use the the timestamp links in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.110" style="s2">description and then sort of say hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.850" end="00:32:54.270" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do the spiel if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.110" end="00:32:57.180" style="s2">click it you know there&#39;s a link in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.270" end="00:32:59.940" style="s2">description to skip to that part I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.180" end="00:33:01.230" style="s2">that works for both like people who come</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.940" end="00:33:02.490" style="s2">into the stream and are like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.230" end="00:33:04.230" style="s2">going on what are we chatting about</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.490" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">there could be like go watch any of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:07.320" style="s2">previous ones and watch the first two to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:09.120" style="s2">three minutes five minutes and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.320" end="00:33:11.130" style="s2">people who are constantly just watching</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.120" end="00:33:12.990" style="s2">the replay because it gets people time</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.130" end="00:33:14.250" style="s2">to be part of it so most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.990" end="00:33:16.200" style="s2">show up in the first two to five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.250" end="00:33:17.610" style="s2">so yeah no I like that and honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.200" end="00:33:19.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have one I don&#39;t know how much you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.610" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">got like I&#39;m here what are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.440" end="00:33:26.520" style="s2">about and so having it more focused on</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:28.350" style="s2">solution raising which and yeah figuring</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.520" end="00:33:30.060" style="s2">out us feel giving it every day for two</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:31.800" style="s2">to five minutes and then also having</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.060" end="00:33:33.720" style="s2">that possibility people can skip it if</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.800" end="00:33:36.740" style="s2">they&#39;re not watching it live as well as</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.720" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">can re-watch it if they come in right</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.740" end="00:33:41.370" style="s2">and depending how complex it gets you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:42.690" style="s2">might almost have like two parts you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:44.070" style="s2">might have like just a really generic</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.690" end="00:33:45.540" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.070" end="00:33:46.800" style="s2">a minute I think they got two minute</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.540" end="00:33:48.660" style="s2">here&#39;s what we did in the last session</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.800" end="00:33:49.950" style="s2">or last few sessions and then be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.660" end="00:33:52.250" style="s2">you can skip to whatever you want here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.950" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">the timestamps do without what you will</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.250" end="00:33:57.390" style="s2">yeah yeah I can reiterate probably what</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.950" style="s2">was like my own agenda before we talked</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.390" end="00:34:00.900" style="s2">about I mean ideally I would also like</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:01.770" style="s2">something to have that role possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.900" end="00:34:04.260" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t want to be on camera</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.770" end="00:34:05.370" style="s2">who wants to show up and do that even if</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.260" end="00:34:07.050" style="s2">they&#39;re just doing out on Mondays we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.370" end="00:34:09.510" style="s2">just you know on tuesdays to be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.050" end="00:34:11.640" style="s2">person who takes notes and says yes this</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.510" end="00:34:13.530" style="s2">is what we discussed cuz that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.640" end="00:34:16.130" style="s2">strong suit he&#39;s like he doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.530" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">like rewatching it don&#39;t sell me an hour</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.130" end="00:34:21.390" style="s2">which I would never do but anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:23.610" style="s2">having someone who could possibly take</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.390" end="00:34:26.460" style="s2">on that role and having a portion of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.610" end="00:34:28.140" style="s2">this that&#39;s not like what is needed</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.460" end="00:34:29.880" style="s2">again I would love to have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.140" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">concentrated group of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.880" end="00:34:32.880" style="s2">meeting like on camera to have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:36.210" style="s2">conversation what day of the week works</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.880" end="00:34:38.700" style="s2">but also not role of note-taker for</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.210" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">every single day and have someone take</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.700" end="00:34:44.130" style="s2">the notes and then I can update the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:46.110" style="s2">description would be it&#39;s amazing how</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.130" end="00:34:49.250" style="s2">many of these like types of sessions</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.110" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">that person would be great for yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.250" end="00:34:54.090" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:55.770" style="s2">you&#39;re also one for this would be great</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.090" end="00:34:57.720" style="s2">and for our Friday meetings and for</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.770" end="00:34:59.520" style="s2">of it but like luckily their lives so II</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.720" end="00:35:01.650" style="s2">like you could rewatch them and get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.520" end="00:35:03.960" style="s2">gist at least they&#39;re like transparently</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.650" end="00:35:05.940" style="s2">there they&#39;re just not transparently</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.960" end="00:35:08.310" style="s2">like they&#39;re not accessible they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.940" end="00:35:10.320" style="s2">usable their current format as easily as</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.310" end="00:35:12.930" style="s2">having here&#39;s what we discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.320" end="00:35:14.430" style="s2">here&#39;s what was decided I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.930" end="00:35:16.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a free version but in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.430" end="00:35:18.060" style="s2">business world there&#39;s apps where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.020" end="00:35:19.950" style="s2">like you can sign up for kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.060" end="00:35:21.630" style="s2">paid bot where can join your zoom room</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.950" end="00:35:23.880" style="s2">and it records it and it transcribes it</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.630" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">so it says like okay Jubilee saying this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.880" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">at this point in time because it knows</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking and then you know if</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:30.240" style="s2">Bentley unmutes and talks it says oh now</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:33.180" style="s2">Bentley&#39;s talking so in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.240" end="00:35:34.680" style="s2">transcript it says Jubilee Bo diddly</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.180" end="00:35:36.030" style="s2">blah blah blah and then it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.680" end="00:35:37.740" style="s2">perfect but it helps sort of set the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.030" end="00:35:39.840" style="s2">table for know he didn&#39;t say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.740" end="00:35:42.180" style="s2">in speech to text issues I&#39;ll just you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.840" end="00:35:45.150" style="s2">know correct yeah but it might be a good</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.180" end="00:35:47.100" style="s2">start the next level and then it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.150" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">work for like it&#39;s like that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.100" end="00:35:52.500" style="s2">actually important about what was right</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:54.540" style="s2">but it is a good focus to have transfer</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.500" end="00:35:54.870" style="s2">there are ways to do a video transcript</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.540" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.870" end="00:35:58.860" style="s2">honor dot IO but it&#39;s a paid service</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">there&#39;s people in the game space and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.860" end="00:36:04.110" style="s2">have it who like it just does that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:06.360" style="s2">transcribes and generally tries to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.110" end="00:36:07.830" style="s2">figure out with your voice person one</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.360" end="00:36:10.080" style="s2">person two and I think you can then tell</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.830" end="00:36:18.150" style="s2">them person 1 into R so it says you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.080" end="00:36:20.730" style="s2">oh sorry I think I have seen YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.150" end="00:36:21.510" style="s2">doing text I have seen YouTube doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.730" end="00:36:24.540" style="s2">text-to-speech</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.510" end="00:36:27.390" style="s2">I think yet they have like you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.540" end="00:36:29.580" style="s2">it to run the like suggested closed</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.390" end="00:36:31.620" style="s2">captioning and it scans it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.580" end="00:36:34.530" style="s2">fairly accurate it&#39;s got some pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.620" end="00:36:36.930" style="s2">comical issues sometimes but you can go</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.530" end="00:36:39.480" style="s2">in there and edit them you see that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.930" end="00:36:41.580" style="s2">live video can you do gif closed caption</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.480" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">online video I think there is a feature</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.580" end="00:36:46.980" style="s2">I think of it might just be like if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">put it on a delay or maybe it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.980" end="00:36:51.480" style="s2">recordings I&#39;ve seen is I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:54.270" style="s2">you probably could have it run on a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.480" end="00:36:57.560" style="s2">recorded video but I think I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.270" end="00:37:00.690" style="s2">you can do it on live I would try to I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.560" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">would be interested but yeah what so</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.690" end="00:37:05.010" style="s2">creating this feel it&#39;s two to five</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:07.340" style="s2">minutes and then wreak happy what we did</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.010" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">in the last session and then giving my</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.340" end="00:37:10.510" style="s2">my ask about</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:13.570" style="s2">what I would like and then I can shoot</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.510" end="00:37:14.830" style="s2">the for the next one okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.570" end="00:37:16.420" style="s2">how you can join here&#39;s how this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.830" end="00:37:18.450" style="s2">going I mean I can probably figure out</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.420" end="00:37:21.460" style="s2">that spiel in less than five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.450" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">even if I am on tangents whichever one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.460" end="00:37:27.150" style="s2">the better one I can cut out and use is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:29.650" style="s2">the go to this and listen to this if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.150" end="00:37:31.300" style="s2">if you want to know what we are talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.650" end="00:37:32.740" style="s2">about and what is what is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.300" end="00:37:33.730" style="s2">where we currently currently are like</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.740" end="00:37:35.290" style="s2">right now it will just be in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.730" end="00:37:36.430" style="s2">description of the previous one and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.290" end="00:37:38.500" style="s2">previous one and there isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.430" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">someone to go to house here&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.500" end="00:37:41.860" style="s2">talked about in last 20 which is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:44.410" style="s2">its own document and copy and pasting</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.860" end="00:37:46.470" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a ton website nor do I want</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.410" end="00:37:49.470" style="s2">it to be at the moment like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.470" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">what is capable I can do a description</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.470" end="00:37:53.140" style="s2">especially if someone else is writing it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:55.480" style="s2">out and I&#39;m just pasting it in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.140" end="00:37:57.130" style="s2">would be ideal and if not like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.480" end="00:37:59.380" style="s2">willing to paste a description that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.130" end="00:38:03.010" style="s2">good to know yeah that&#39;s the level of my</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.380" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">I can&#39;t write it out figure it out but</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.010" end="00:38:11.830" style="s2">yeah so I think that&#39;s a good house in</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.790" end="00:39:21.640" style="s2">we made like maybe we don&#39;t need to hear</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.380" end="00:39:22.630" style="s2">what reason scores every time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.640" end="00:39:24.250" style="s2">also a good practice</p>

<p begin="00:39:56.920" end="00:40:00.670" style="s2">both the three of us generally so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.380" end="00:40:01.809" style="s2">some of us are showing up for the 9 a.m.</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.390" end="00:40:52.450" style="s2">you&#39;re like this is to game a because</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.710" end="00:40:54.789" style="s2">it&#39;s a contest because like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.450" end="00:40:57.900" style="s2">it&#39;s too much from a box it&#39;s like does</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.779" end="00:41:06.250" style="s2">projects like that to me is the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.730" end="00:41:08.559" style="s2">cuz there&#39;s people who are game B who</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.250" end="00:41:10.119" style="s2">also aren&#39;t game be like they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.559" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">how to create all new in solutions they</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.119" end="00:41:13.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t dealt with that part of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:16.119" style="s2">ego and they&#39;re like we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.900" end="00:41:18.099" style="s2">come up with with jealousy strong words</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.119" end="00:41:20.140" style="s2">but like conflict of interest and like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.099" end="00:41:22.059" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t want like not stepping on my</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.140" end="00:41:23.950" style="s2">toes and that&#39;s that&#39;s part of this</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.610" end="00:41:39.360" style="s2">if you sometimes fail at that this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.980" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">not our intention</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.360" end="00:41:43.800" style="s2">I want your project to succeed I want my</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:46.290" style="s2">project to succeed that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.800" end="00:41:49.320" style="s2">having this this hour-long session right</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.290" end="00:41:50.940" style="s2">for its can&#39;t be all about you but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.320" end="00:41:52.950" style="s2">also absolutely can be something</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.940" end="00:41:56.550" style="s2">somewhat some about you some about you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.950" end="00:41:59.670" style="s2">in your project so like if we did want</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.550" end="00:42:02.970" style="s2">to put a link I put a link into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.670" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">Wikipedia mastermind group article and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.970" end="00:42:09.420" style="s2">then a link actually happen to know this</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.590" style="s2">guy on the hotseat description but</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.420" end="00:42:14.730" style="s2">there&#39;s several others I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.590" end="00:42:16.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a great hot seat description of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.730" end="00:42:18.750" style="s2">course I could just say mastermind in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.320" end="00:42:20.580" style="s2">the for Mac and then be flexible we</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.750" end="00:42:25.890" style="s2">don&#39;t because we made me put the hot</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.580" end="00:42:27.900" style="s2">seat format but yeah I just just say</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.890" end="00:42:30.080" style="s2">come together to work on our projects to</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.900" end="00:42:33.900" style="s2">make improve the world in their place</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.080" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">and we do it you know and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.900" end="00:42:44.400" style="s2">mastermind - maybe the format I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:46.380" style="s2">wondering if the term round table is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.400" end="00:42:47.400" style="s2">good sort of like generic description</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.380" end="00:42:49.320" style="s2">like if it&#39;s the Saturday morning</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.400" end="00:42:50.670" style="s2">project round table we&#39;re sort of meant</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.320" end="00:42:53.670" style="s2">to be like everyone goes around chairs</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.670" end="00:42:55.500" style="s2">and then we might end up saying hey you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.670" end="00:42:57.390" style="s2">know we&#39;re gonna try the hot seat as</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.500" end="00:42:59.700" style="s2">sort of one of the defining features of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.390" end="00:43:01.260" style="s2">this round table but to me that gives a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.700" end="00:43:02.850" style="s2">vibe of light everyone comes everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.260" end="00:43:05.190" style="s2">shares everyone gets something out of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.850" end="00:43:06.750" style="s2">which is it necessarily truism in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.190" end="00:43:10.500" style="s2">other sessions but this one is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.750" end="00:43:13.470" style="s2">be that yeah we&#39;re focusing night</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.500" end="00:43:16.110" style="s2">I think that&#39;s yeah I&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.470" end="00:43:17.670" style="s2">if round table implies more like a news</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.110" end="00:43:21.390" style="s2">show round table where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.670" end="00:43:23.460" style="s2">pontificating on what&#39;s going on but I</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.390" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">guess if it&#39;s project focus the project</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.460" end="00:43:29.640" style="s2">round table and it&#39;s also like round</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:31.880" style="s2">table also has less of a like mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.640" end="00:43:34.020" style="s2">like we examine Center the minutes</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.880" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna comments like cuz I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.020" end="00:43:37.740" style="s2">done anything in the last week and I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:39.090" style="s2">like okay so we all allow down time and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.740" end="00:43:41.190" style="s2">a round table makes it sound like you</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.090" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">can drop in and drop out with good and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.190" end="00:43:46.650" style="s2">it also makes it sound less like I need</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:48.760" style="s2">to have had my together and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.650" end="00:43:51.070" style="s2">stroke</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.760" end="00:43:54.250" style="s2">I did nothing this last week that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.070" end="00:43:56.920" style="s2">valid and take on something new then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.250" end="00:43:59.110" style="s2">next one and I we should probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.920" end="00:44:01.090" style="s2">explicitly say that you don&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.110" end="00:44:04.390" style="s2">to have a project to participate because</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.090" end="00:44:05.950" style="s2">you can&#39;t give feedback and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.390" end="00:44:07.660" style="s2">a really good point that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.950" end="00:44:09.340" style="s2">that I want to get more of these people</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.660" end="00:44:10.930" style="s2">who don&#39;t have projects but especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.340" end="00:44:12.850" style="s2">if you are interested in to me you might</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.930" end="00:44:14.170" style="s2">want to help like I want to get inside</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.850" end="00:44:16.300" style="s2">that person&#39;s head to figure out how do</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.170" end="00:44:19.000" style="s2">we get more of you that&#39;s that you know</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.790" end="00:45:32.010" style="s2">here but facilitate this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.650" end="00:45:34.180" style="s2">and pop people up and down as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.010" end="00:45:37.390" style="s2">might be the note taker or something</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.180" end="00:45:40.060" style="s2">right with green odd but take a stab at</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.390" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">it before that like rotating through</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.060" end="00:45:43.570" style="s2">that to showcasing hey then that might</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:45.400" style="s2">even be its position that someone&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.570" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">actually I prefer that to not be on</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.400" end="00:45:53.320" style="s2">camera just be taking notes I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:55.030" style="s2">that&#39;s not me but because they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.320" end="00:45:56.410" style="s2">from my point of view there&#39;s no baggage</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.030" end="00:45:57.910" style="s2">associated with that term the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.410" end="00:45:59.230" style="s2">that game be and mastermind and worried</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.910" end="00:46:00.910" style="s2">that will get mired in the well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.230" end="00:46:01.810" style="s2">not mastermind or that&#39;s not game be and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.910" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.810" end="00:46:07.360" style="s2">as opposed to just do it well hash it</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:09.310" style="s2">out later maybe we shouldn&#39;t have talked</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.360" end="00:46:11.290" style="s2">about that or like Oh baby we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.310" end="00:46:12.970" style="s2">that Porsha next session because that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.290" end="00:46:13.960" style="s2">kind of got negative or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.970" end="00:46:16.120" style="s2">reason is</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.960" end="00:46:20.050" style="s2">turns out the eugenics project was not</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.120" end="00:46:22.410" style="s2">very kidding me we know for next time</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.050" end="00:46:22.410" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.010" end="00:46:36.340" style="s2">I have a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.050" end="00:46:38.650" style="s2">um I&#39;m wondering I&#39;m a little confused</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.340" end="00:46:43.870" style="s2">with all the different times and videos</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.650" end="00:46:45.850" style="s2">and groups so Jubilee you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.870" end="00:46:48.070" style="s2">before that we could possibly have just</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.850" end="00:46:50.170" style="s2">like a session where we&#39;re imagining the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.070" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">world with our projects in it or with</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.170" end="00:46:57.880" style="s2">like my project isn&#39;t really a specific</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:47:00.730" style="s2">project but it&#39;s really a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.880" end="00:47:09.160" style="s2">all solution projects this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.730" end="00:47:11.110" style="s2">supports projects widely and shows the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.160" end="00:47:14.650" style="s2">connectivity like our interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.110" end="00:47:16.810" style="s2">and how important that is but it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.650" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">specific project that would support all</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.810" end="00:47:20.470" style="s2">of these projects anyway I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:23.800" style="s2">curious if there&#39;s a specific group or</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.470" end="00:47:25.210" style="s2">time or it&#39;d be good to discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.800" end="00:47:28.600" style="s2">kind of thing where it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.210" end="00:47:30.460" style="s2">specific foreplay or thing does that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.600" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">make sense I think what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.460" end="00:47:35.110" style="s2">about is maybe the idea cafe for</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:36.700" style="s2">projects because there&#39;s solution</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.110" end="00:47:38.560" style="s2">raising which is you know we do we talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.700" end="00:47:39.820" style="s2">with the possibility of the future but</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.560" end="00:47:41.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t bring your project to it all</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.820" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">you bring you to it and any knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.110" end="00:47:44.260" style="s2">you have so you kind of bring your</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.120" style="s2">project to it it&#39;s my project you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.260" end="00:47:47.980" style="s2">to me it&#39;s like my umbrella project to</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.120" end="00:47:49.750" style="s2">do to do solution raising but</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.980" end="00:47:53.400" style="s2">theoretically every other Friday we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.750" end="00:47:55.810" style="s2">having idea cafes on Fridays at noon on</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.400" end="00:47:57.790" style="s2">like a question that you can bring your</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.810" end="00:48:00.070" style="s2">project so last time it was how could</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.790" end="00:48:02.680" style="s2">your project help during the pandemic if</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.530" end="00:48:14.790" style="s2">Shilo you and I could brainstorm more</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">questions like that that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.790" end="00:48:19.110" style="s2">more the generative conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:21.510" style="s2">what all of our projects existed in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.110" end="00:48:24.180" style="s2">world right and what what are those that</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.890" end="00:50:49.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a pain yeah it&#39;s a bit of a pain</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.960" end="00:50:51.380" style="s2">it started doing that and then it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.700" end="00:50:53.269" style="s2">like you still have to do the posting</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.380" end="00:50:54.619" style="s2">and that people see and respond to and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.269" end="00:50:56.749" style="s2">then they respond to that and not this</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.619" end="00:50:59.059" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a little but then there is</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.769" end="00:52:22.700" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a calendar there kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.660" end="00:52:24.109" style="s2">under a journal is just kind of working</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.700" end="00:52:25.849" style="s2">with knack and figure you know right</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.109" end="00:52:27.230" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a physical calendar</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.849" end="00:52:28.700" style="s2">right then I can see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.230" end="00:52:31.130" style="s2">over the course of a week or over the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.700" end="00:52:34.069" style="s2">course of a month okay that feature</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.130" end="00:52:35.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work great a knack I it does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.069" end="00:52:37.880" style="s2">but for some reason it doesn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.900" end="00:52:41.029" style="s2">end time so it just assumes all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.880" end="00:52:41.609" style="s2">events are two hours for and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.029" end="00:52:43.019" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work great</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.609" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">four time zones with just how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.019" end="00:52:46.710" style="s2">designed so right now it&#39;s just a grid</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:48.450" style="s2">and there&#39;s a column for each I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.710" end="00:52:52.220" style="s2">I&#39;m tracking three time zones Pacific</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.450" end="00:52:54.630" style="s2">Eastern and and UTC but we can add more</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.220" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">and then the idea there is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.630" end="00:52:57.720" style="s2">sort of you can look at the full list or</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.019" style="s2">you can go look at a project and say</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.720" end="00:53:03.869" style="s2">tell me what that projects events are</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.019" end="00:53:07.319" style="s2">and we can yeah and we can look at doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.869" end="00:53:09.329" style="s2">a calendar but yeah that&#39;s one area</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.319" end="00:53:12.329" style="s2">where the calendar at NACA isn&#39;t perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.329" end="00:53:14.039" style="s2">um we can explore and also anything</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.329" end="00:53:17.369" style="s2">that&#39;s created in someone else&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.039" end="00:53:19.259" style="s2">isn&#39;t gonna be like having like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.369" end="00:53:21.089" style="s2">individual if I want to take if I want</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.259" end="00:53:22.739" style="s2">to know what is happening with together</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.089" end="00:53:23.880" style="s2">tech and then also what&#39;s happening like</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.739" end="00:53:27.180" style="s2">I want to be able to choose wiki</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.880" end="00:53:28.890" style="s2">lecturers or reasons for like pick the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.180" end="00:53:30.599" style="s2">ones that I want to follow and then see</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.890" end="00:53:32.009" style="s2">when there&#39;s things alive and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.599" end="00:53:33.749" style="s2">know what their participation is do they</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.009" end="00:53:35.730" style="s2">want people live on camera and I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.749" end="00:53:38.609" style="s2">like or just someone to watch and some</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.730" end="00:53:39.930" style="s2">project to participate live or is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.609" end="00:53:42.690" style="s2">not even necessary I can just watch it</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.930" end="00:53:45.509" style="s2">at any point during the week and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.690" end="00:53:48.119" style="s2">like one of the things that each event</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.509" end="00:53:50.670" style="s2">has a public URL and like it</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.119" end="00:53:52.109" style="s2">participates URL so that the public list</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.670" end="00:53:53.549" style="s2">always has the public URL but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.109" end="00:54:00.809" style="s2">join unless you&#39;re a member and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.549" end="00:54:03.690" style="s2">signed up for it after playing with it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.809" end="00:54:05.489" style="s2">to figure it out but speaking of which I</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.690" end="00:54:06.599" style="s2">came in contact this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.489" end="00:54:08.249" style="s2">things I would like to do let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.599" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">start a whole new thing and blast by but</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.249" end="00:54:11.249" style="s2">it&#39;s less of it also something else</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:12.749" style="s2">they&#39;d like to say but like with under</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.249" end="00:54:15.390" style="s2">together tech would talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.749" end="00:54:16.470" style="s2">trading projects from scratch just what</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.390" end="00:54:18.150" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to figure out what solution</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.470" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">easy people bringing their projects to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.150" end="00:54:23.190" style="s2">it and and then but you&#39;re an ownership</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:26.099" style="s2">your project together tech doesn&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.190" end="00:54:29.759" style="s2">it there&#39;s no part of the 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.099" end="00:54:31.710" style="s2">and $100,000 is finding things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.759" end="00:54:34.380" style="s2">already meet our needs and buying them</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.710" end="00:54:36.749" style="s2">like there are so many team building</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.380" end="00:54:39.749" style="s2">apps team building like Monday calm and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.749" end="00:54:41.849" style="s2">task management ones and there was one I</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.749" end="00:54:44.549" style="s2">came across this week that looked cool</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.849" end="00:54:46.589" style="s2">but the pricing was so astronomical that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.549" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">I was like who would ever pay this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.589" end="00:54:54.989" style="s2">like two hundred fifty dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:55.759" style="s2">or basically like a tree like an idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.989" end="00:54:58.489" style="s2">tree</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.759" end="00:55:01.249" style="s2">that was like hi why would anyone pay</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.489" end="00:55:02.919" style="s2">that and but anyway that because all</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.249" end="00:55:05.569" style="s2">these things I think are not sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.919" end="00:55:06.979" style="s2">their their success is either to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.569" end="00:55:08.569" style="s2">bought by Google and Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.979" end="00:55:10.759" style="s2">basically to go into business or</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.569" end="00:55:12.439" style="s2">possibly stay and then but no one stays</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.759" end="00:55:15.049" style="s2">in the space right someone buys you and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.439" end="00:55:16.339" style="s2">so if we&#39;re the them that buys you that</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.049" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">leg well yours was gonna go to business</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.339" end="00:55:19.519" style="s2">anyway a hundred thousand dollars is</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:21.319" style="s2">better than nothing and then having an</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.519" end="00:55:23.929" style="s2">actual but it would need to be something</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.319" end="00:55:25.609" style="s2">that meets 90% of our needs that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.929" end="00:55:29.389" style="s2">would want to have as part of under our</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.609" end="00:55:31.909" style="s2">umbrella but like actually that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.389" end="00:55:33.169" style="s2">feasible solution like to buy something</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.909" end="00:55:36.109" style="s2">that&#39;s already there we&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.169" end="00:55:38.059" style="s2">instead of $250 a month for like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.109" end="00:55:41.389" style="s2">ridiculous well how much do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.059" end="00:55:43.669" style="s2">need to make to run this if your options</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.389" end="00:55:45.380" style="s2">go out of business or or stay in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.669" end="00:55:47.689" style="s2">business you have a job you have you</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.380" end="00:55:50.029" style="s2">know like what do we need so humanity</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.689" end="00:55:52.249" style="s2">can use this for free basically not</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.029" end="00:55:54.739" style="s2">every new customer pays X amount of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.249" end="00:55:57.589" style="s2">money there&#39;s an actual cost anyway to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.739" end="00:55:59.029" style="s2">have the first project we buy if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.589" end="00:56:01.639" style="s2">ever an option that maybe take is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.029" end="00:56:02.989" style="s2">be much more complex and much more but</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.639" end="00:56:04.699" style="s2">once we start doing that in other</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.989" end="00:56:06.469" style="s2">industries then that might be the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.699" end="00:56:07.909" style="s2">start might be the starting point let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.469" end="00:56:11.479" style="s2">find out what&#39;s in food apps do any of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.909" end="00:56:13.789" style="s2">them work for us can we buy them instead</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.479" end="00:56:15.849" style="s2">of right yeah I mean personally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.789" end="00:56:18.409" style="s2">kind of my end goal for together tech is</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.849" end="00:56:23.809" style="s2">where like it becomes this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.409" end="00:56:25.219" style="s2">a group owned co-op where it&#39;s a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.809" end="00:56:27.409" style="s2">that owns tech like that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.219" end="00:56:28.609" style="s2">its yeah and my point was just instead</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.409" end="00:56:30.709" style="s2">of it being an end goal it might</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.609" end="00:56:32.419" style="s2">actually be our first like it is we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.709" end="00:56:33.589" style="s2">our first from our project projects</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.419" end="00:56:35.029" style="s2">right that we&#39;re not letting go up</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.589" end="00:56:37.339" style="s2">together to act as an oh man that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.029" end="00:56:40.429" style="s2">and that but like as under together tech</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.339" end="00:56:42.049" style="s2">having 10,000 people buy an app or you</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.429" end="00:56:45.199" style="s2">know putting in 10 bucks or 25 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.049" end="00:56:48.199" style="s2">each for now we own a version that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.199" end="00:56:50.419" style="s2">$10 a month right that&#39;s not X amount</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.199" end="00:56:51.829" style="s2">because now we on Monday comm and we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.419" end="00:56:53.419" style="s2">use it and we can open it up to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.829" end="00:56:56.269" style="s2">world so the world can use it no matter</p>

<p begin="00:56:56.269" end="00:56:59.959" style="s2">something like that like none of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.159" end="00:57:01.429" style="s2">ones that exist are free for very good</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.959" end="00:57:04.399" style="s2">reason they need to make a living they</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.429" end="00:57:07.159" style="s2">need to but like it&#39;s humanity owns it</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.399" end="00:57:08.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a completely different but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.159" end="00:57:10.609" style="s2">need to make 10 bucks a month</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.660" end="00:57:12.470" style="s2">person 4/4 time but if people are paying</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.609" end="00:57:14.900" style="s2">that into it it&#39;s way cheaper than what</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.470" end="00:57:17.780" style="s2">most of them are charging it&#39;s not per</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.900" end="00:57:19.579" style="s2">organization so it&#39;s like do you agree</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.780" end="00:57:21.589" style="s2">in the bigger mission of together tech</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.579" end="00:57:23.450" style="s2">and then like starting with something</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.589" end="00:57:26.150" style="s2">that would actually meet our needs in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.450" end="00:57:27.980" style="s2">very real way right that is about</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.150" end="00:57:30.589" style="s2">creating a team working through tasks</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.980" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">together and doing and could that be</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.589" end="00:57:33.710" style="s2">used for projects but anyway that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.770" style="s2">just something up in City myths it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.710" end="00:57:38.690" style="s2">like oh this is actually more feasible</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.770" end="00:57:40.970" style="s2">it could be something we could do what</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.690" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">10,000 people 100,000 once we got 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.970" end="00:57:45.140" style="s2">is partly what exists that we want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:47.539" style="s2">buy and it would be in that realm would</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.140" end="00:57:49.400" style="s2">be our first one would be in them team</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.539" end="00:57:51.710" style="s2">management project management one thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.400" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">I haven&#39;t looked though is there also</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.710" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">could be some pretty good open source</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:59.089" style="s2">ones and then we just need to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">hosting and someone would I need to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.089" end="00:58:06.740" style="s2">compensate the person who&#39;s keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:09.980" style="s2">up and running and stuff like that what</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.740" end="00:58:11.690" style="s2">would that even be called hmm like I</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.980" end="00:58:15.109" style="s2">know it opens so I can Google open</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.690" end="00:58:17.480" style="s2">source but what is I mean I don&#39;t like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.109" end="00:58:19.849" style="s2">TD management / task management right</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.480" end="00:58:21.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah and I don&#39;t think we need</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.849" end="00:58:23.270" style="s2">to they&#39;d probably be good to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.410" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">long conversation about what features do</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.270" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">we think we need and then then we can go</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:33.109" style="s2">and someone can do some time researching</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:35.539" style="s2">that and I think there&#39;s a website that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.109" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">I think phosphites</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.539" end="00:58:40.339" style="s2">let&#39;s find out the source software well</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:42.470" style="s2">they often list alternatives so you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.339" end="00:58:46.670" style="s2">go in there and I think you can just</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.470" end="00:58:48.020" style="s2">type in and or there&#39;s the cut so</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.670" end="00:58:49.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of websites we can say</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.020" end="00:58:51.640" style="s2">and you could even just Google</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.279" end="00:58:55.430" style="s2">alternative to so if we pick one we like</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.640" end="00:58:57.500" style="s2">we might just say alternative to and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.430" end="00:58:59.270" style="s2">then research those alternatives and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.500" end="00:59:01.339" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it is that most of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.270" end="00:59:03.829" style="s2">ones that are way too expensive in my in</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.339" end="00:59:05.569" style="s2">my line have a free option right so</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.829" end="00:59:07.190" style="s2">finding five or six people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.569" end="00:59:08.990" style="s2">work on the project and having like</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.190" end="00:59:10.309" style="s2">we&#39;re doing Monday comm for the next two</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.990" end="00:59:12.680" style="s2">weeks now we&#39;re doing this one now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.309" end="00:59:14.900" style="s2">doing this one and seeing what they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.680" end="00:59:17.480" style="s2">and what is there one that we would like</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.900" end="00:59:19.309" style="s2">or is there one can we use these</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.480" end="00:59:21.270" style="s2">features what features do they have and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.309" end="00:59:24.450" style="s2">then can we create one with</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.270" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">features would be ideal yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.450" end="00:59:28.440" style="s2">with $100,000 I&#39;m pretty sure we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:32.340" style="s2">pay someone to put together an</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.440" end="00:59:34.710" style="s2">open-source one that is that is even</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.340" end="00:59:36.690" style="s2">better or there&#39;s one out there that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.710" end="00:59:38.190" style="s2">exists that has that meets 90% of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.690" end="00:59:39.750" style="s2">needs already this been done there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.190" end="00:59:41.880" style="s2">a leg it&#39;s just about lying in and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.750" end="00:59:43.740" style="s2">having those people be part of them</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.880" end="00:59:47.040" style="s2">transparent open conversation what do</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.740" end="00:59:50.130" style="s2">you need your mutant Oh a troll no I</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:53.160" style="s2">think you saw the phone we can&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.130" end="00:59:56.880" style="s2">you we can see you that&#39;s me yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.160" end="00:59:58.560" style="s2">thinking aren&#39;t open source app part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.880" end="01:00:02.520" style="s2">the creative commons and is there a way</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.560" end="01:00:04.380" style="s2">to search that way don&#39;t get Creative</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.520" end="01:00:07.020" style="s2">Commons licenses when they do open</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.380" end="01:00:10.080" style="s2">source apps that are free to anyone well</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.020" end="01:00:12.260" style="s2">you can actually have open source</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.080" end="01:00:21.120" style="s2">without most of them are some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.260" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">there&#39;s several licenses yeah we would</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.120" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">have to look at the licensing but why I</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:30.330" style="s2">was thinking I think there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:35.490" style="s2">sites that are specifically their goal</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.330" end="01:00:40.760" style="s2">is to help promote open software so they</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.490" end="01:00:40.760" style="s2">kind of our place that people go to I</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.470" end="01:00:47.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to know you would definitely</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.580" end="01:00:49.320" style="s2">classify Bentley that was like okay it</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.340" end="01:00:52.410" style="s2">turns out that website was wrong so</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.320" end="01:00:53.880" style="s2">ignore that that sounds like a cool</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.410" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">option something where I can be like</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.880" end="01:00:57.030" style="s2">like Facebook but we own it my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.310" style="s2">open source</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.030" end="01:01:02.850" style="s2">whoa so you can you can do I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.310" end="01:01:04.890" style="s2">there&#39;s alternative to dot something but</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.850" end="01:01:07.050" style="s2">if you could you can just search</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.890" end="01:01:08.970" style="s2">alternative to and put in the name and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.050" end="01:01:10.230" style="s2">the I can&#39;t remember the name of all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.970" end="01:01:14.250" style="s2">sites but there are some that will come</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.230" end="01:01:16.710" style="s2">up and like open source calm is a place</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.250" end="01:01:18.570" style="s2">where you like the top line is top seven</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.710" end="01:01:21.360" style="s2">open-source project management tools for</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.570" end="01:01:25.980" style="s2">agile teams five open source</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.360" end="01:01:29.730" style="s2">alternatives to Trello so that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.980" end="01:01:31.470" style="s2">probably be a good resource to just like</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.730" end="01:01:33.180" style="s2">research on I get it I get the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.470" end="01:01:34.250" style="s2">difference between open source and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.180" end="01:01:36.830" style="s2">Facebook and Google</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.250" end="01:01:38.870" style="s2">but somebody needs to make these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.830" end="01:01:40.250" style="s2">we&#39;re like everyone can come to it where</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.870" end="01:01:41.660" style="s2">it isn&#39;t you don&#39;t need to understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.250" end="01:01:43.550" style="s2">what open source is because like every</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.660" end="01:01:44.630" style="s2">team having their own little will take</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.550" end="01:01:47.270" style="s2">that and we&#39;ll run with it and we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.630" end="01:01:49.220" style="s2">make this work for us isn&#39;t the same as</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.270" end="01:01:50.990" style="s2">like I can go and see all of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.220" end="01:01:53.390" style="s2">projects that I&#39;m part of I can go and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.990" end="01:01:54.920" style="s2">be part of all the Trello boards that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.390" end="01:02:01.130" style="s2">want right from the open source but</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.920" end="01:02:02.210" style="s2">that&#39;s just interesting uh it could get</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.130" end="01:02:06.560" style="s2">I think we&#39;re gonna end this right away</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.210" end="01:02:08.210" style="s2">anyway right step out for a second so we</p>
