<p begin="00:00:07.360" end="00:00:13.580" style="s2">so maybe yeah I&#39;d like to like in a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.610" end="00:00:14.930" style="s2">formally begin the conversation now but</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.580" end="00:00:17.839" style="s2">obviously everything we can use</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.930" end="00:00:20.289" style="s2">everything from behind and so maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.839" end="00:00:23.689" style="s2">so for some context for people that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.289" end="00:00:30.159" style="s2">potentially watching this I released a</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.689" end="00:00:34.760" style="s2">video about Jordan Peterson and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.159" end="00:00:38.750" style="s2">I suppose in an attempt to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.760" end="00:00:41.300" style="s2">him by comparing and contrasting him</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.750" end="00:00:42.860" style="s2">with Russell Brand and these are two</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.300" end="00:00:45.470" style="s2">figures who are on one level deeply</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.860" end="00:00:47.840" style="s2">spiritual but are often points maybe of</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.470" end="00:00:50.710" style="s2">an ideological spectrum and we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:55.130" style="s2">explore maybe their nuance of that and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.710" end="00:00:57.320" style="s2">it was my attempt as was having come</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.130" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">from a left-wing background and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.320" end="00:01:01.220" style="s2">identifying as progressive to try and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:05.720" style="s2">bring an open-minded perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.220" end="00:01:08.740" style="s2">peterson and and using kind of clips</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.720" end="00:01:11.210" style="s2">from Russell Brand and Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.740" end="00:01:15.170" style="s2">discussions as a kind of a way to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:16.850" style="s2">illuminate that and they&#39;ve got a I</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.170" end="00:01:20.479" style="s2">think I&#39;ve got a pretty good response I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.850" end="00:01:23.870" style="s2">got eighty thousand views and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.479" end="00:01:26.570" style="s2">for me it&#39;s signals I desire for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.870" end="00:01:28.700" style="s2">response particularly from the left that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.570" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">was more than automatic dismissal and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.700" end="00:01:32.540" style="s2">demonizing Peterson but actually being</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:35.390" style="s2">able to say this is what&#39;s good about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.540" end="00:01:39.229" style="s2">and this is what maybe is problematic</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.390" end="00:01:40.940" style="s2">and I and so that that happened and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.229" end="00:01:42.830" style="s2">and a couple of weeks later you sent me</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.940" end="00:01:47.420" style="s2">an email saying I wrote a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.830" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">your essay or of the video and my</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.420" end="00:01:51.650" style="s2">immediate response was kind of to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:53.690" style="s2">into that slightly panicked mode about</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.650" end="00:01:57.140" style="s2">what you might have said because I read</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.690" end="00:02:00.979" style="s2">the critique that you wrote of Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.140" end="00:02:03.409" style="s2">Robbins essay and and found that yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.979" end="00:02:06.439" style="s2">penetrating analysis in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.409" end="00:02:08.330" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t just playing the ideas but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.439" end="00:02:11.510" style="s2">was actually diving into maybe some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.330" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">the psychology of the the author or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.510" end="00:02:14.210" style="s2">person but anyways I&#39;m a tree and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:17.030" style="s2">Enneagram</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.210" end="00:02:21.050" style="s2">which is very achievable image-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.030" end="00:02:22.790" style="s2">and so I I carry a lot of that just fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.050" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">of how people think of me or what they</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.790" end="00:02:27.320" style="s2">may think of means that this is their</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">kind of a sensitive territory but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.320" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">other thing in terms of bringing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:32.960" style="s2">personal dimension in that I found</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:35.390" style="s2">interesting was that I had already</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.960" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">warmed to you as a writer and thinker</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.390" end="00:02:39.800" style="s2">because one of your pieces on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:42.650" style="s2">devouring mother which was written about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.800" end="00:02:46.520" style="s2">broadly you know the shadow of the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.650" end="00:02:48.170" style="s2">also helped me with family dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.520" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">I was experiencing on a trip back home</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.170" end="00:02:53.000" style="s2">to rural Ireland so already there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">this sense of I suppose an appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.000" end="00:02:59.540" style="s2">and an affinity which I suppose allowed</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:05.270" style="s2">me to be more receptive and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.540" end="00:03:06.830" style="s2">these things are quite on one level sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.270" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">of but actually quite important for it</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.830" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">to be able to have a dialogue that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">is kind of this sense of generosity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">willingness so there&#39;s a bridge on which</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:19.640" style="s2">you can have it so I just wanted to name</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:20.630" style="s2">that maybe the background to the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.640" end="00:03:23.720" style="s2">that were going on in the background</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.630" end="00:03:25.820" style="s2">that maybe informs our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.720" end="00:03:29.180" style="s2">which I feel has been productive so far</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.820" end="00:03:30.890" style="s2">mm-hmm okay well that&#39;s those two those</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.180" end="00:03:34.220" style="s2">two poles right the devouring mother and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.890" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">the tyrannical father our articulations</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.220" end="00:03:39.650" style="s2">of Peterson right which he get he gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:43.190" style="s2">from young and new men and all that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.650" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">what what I&#39;ve been seeing right in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.190" end="00:03:49.010" style="s2">them and the culture in general and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">the reaction to to Peterson is let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.010" end="00:03:54.770" style="s2">fear of the tyrannical father and which</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:56.930" style="s2">I think goes along with the election of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.770" end="00:04:00.290" style="s2">Trump I mean if you think of two figures</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.930" end="00:04:02.390" style="s2">today who are two male figures who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.290" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">more prevalent in the culture you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.390" end="00:04:07.190" style="s2">say Trump and Peterson and I kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:08.930" style="s2">them on opposite poles the father is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.190" end="00:04:11.480" style="s2">such a threatening figure in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.930" end="00:04:16.690" style="s2">postmodern culture and that two people</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.480" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">on the Left that this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.690" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">this is the reason for all the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">polarized you know reaction to Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">and I think that that maybe was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.110" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">the core I felt of the Crips T my video</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.180" end="00:04:36.190" style="s2">which was that I set up a problem which</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:38.139" style="s2">was that we live in a polarized culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.190" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">we are forced to take positions on</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.139" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">Peterson before him or against him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:47.500" style="s2">this reduces the complexity and then as</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">you rightly point out there is a an</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.500" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">obvious irony in while I do way up</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:58.719" style="s2">Peterson and brand at the end I come</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:05:02.440" style="s2">down with a criticism from a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.719" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">perspective and say you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.440" end="00:05:08.530" style="s2">close the video by saying that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.900" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">we can&#39;t afford this type of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:13.599" style="s2">right now where we are and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:15.699" style="s2">it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a really spot-on</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.599" end="00:05:18.729" style="s2">criticism and it&#39;s one that I was aware</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.699" end="00:05:20.919" style="s2">of as I was doing it and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.729" end="00:05:22.780" style="s2">maybe just to share what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.919" end="00:05:28.719" style="s2">for me that led me to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.780" end="00:05:32.229" style="s2">because I I think that um I am within a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.719" end="00:05:35.259" style="s2">very left-wing progressive circle in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.229" end="00:05:39.849" style="s2">London where you know there was quite a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.259" end="00:05:41.110" style="s2">strong queer LGBTQ community and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.849" end="00:05:44.169" style="s2">know these are my friends these are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.110" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">people I see at parties and so similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.169" end="00:05:50.529" style="s2">to do any association with Peterson that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:53.500" style="s2">is that wasn&#39;t rejecting did carry a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.529" end="00:05:55.810" style="s2">fear of being out grouped and it does</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.500" end="00:05:58.569" style="s2">you know and as you you reference Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.810" end="00:05:59.979" style="s2">green Noel&#39;s articles that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.569" end="00:06:01.719" style="s2">that is a very personal thing you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.979" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">seen as a good social ally you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.719" end="00:06:07.180" style="s2">seen as a good you know sexual partner</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:10.870" style="s2">it&#39;s at that level of rejection you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.180" end="00:06:12.430" style="s2">and and well that&#39;s precisely did the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.870" end="00:06:14.860" style="s2">devouring mother which doesn&#39;t allow you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.430" end="00:06:16.389" style="s2">and have an individual point of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.860" end="00:06:18.909" style="s2">right it doesn&#39;t allow you to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.389" end="00:06:20.650" style="s2">heterodox or a point of view is because</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.909" end="00:06:23.199" style="s2">you&#39;re devoured by the by the tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:25.200" style="s2">right you you can&#39;t stand out or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.199" end="00:06:28.890" style="s2">in danger actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.200" end="00:06:32.190" style="s2">yeah and and I think this so I really</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.890" end="00:06:37.490" style="s2">you know I really felt this big anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.190" end="00:06:39.870" style="s2">about doing a piece on Peterson and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.490" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">wanted on one level to bring this meta</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.870" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">modern perspective where we could really</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:44.580" style="s2">say yes and to Peterson like what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">what are the good things that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:49.950" style="s2">bringing but also felt a lot of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">it was internal pressure</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.950" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">it was my pitch elation to the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:07:00.510" style="s2">block to kind of come down in a critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:02.790" style="s2">fashion and I think it&#39;s just I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.510" end="00:07:05.070" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.790" end="00:07:09.210" style="s2">maybe make visible and make public is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.070" end="00:07:13.170" style="s2">that I felt a lot of anxiety and coming</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.210" end="00:07:15.510" style="s2">down coming down with a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.170" end="00:07:18.840" style="s2">criticism was a way of relating that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.510" end="00:07:22.790" style="s2">ultimately I did feel a strong pressure</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.840" end="00:07:25.800" style="s2">to display loyalty to my in-group yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.790" end="00:07:27.750" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s not as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.800" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">you know I did it from a place of fear I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.750" end="00:07:33.150" style="s2">also genuinely believe that his</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:35.210" style="s2">characterization of post-modernism is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.150" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">bit of a straw man that he</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.210" end="00:07:39.630" style="s2">over-exaggerates the fears of collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">action and all of those things I also</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.630" end="00:07:43.860" style="s2">believe but in there is more going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:46.170" style="s2">beneath the surface and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.860" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">what I&#39;m finding in this conversational</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.170" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">space that were in is that were</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">surfacing in a true psychological sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:55.020" style="s2">the thing behind the thing so yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:56.310" style="s2">have our arguments about issues but</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.020" end="00:08:00.780" style="s2">actually what&#39;s going in beat the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.310" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">surface it&#39;s my fear of you know people</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.780" end="00:08:05.100" style="s2">having a go of me the next party that I</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">matched because I don&#39;t criticize</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.100" end="00:08:11.160" style="s2">Peterson strongly enough for you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:14.820" style="s2">his view climate change or Trump or</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.160" end="00:08:16.980" style="s2">women right so yeah be interested to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.820" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">your reflection on that and is are there</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.980" end="00:08:21.150" style="s2">maybe any reference points that might</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:23.250" style="s2">enrich that well I you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.150" end="00:08:25.200" style="s2">you if you listen to his discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.250" end="00:08:27.750" style="s2">with Russell Brand which I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.200" end="00:08:30.150" style="s2">great discussion by the way I thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.750" end="00:08:35.220" style="s2">they both they both were able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">conversation a fruitful and enriching</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.220" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:44.339" style="s2">out being for or against each other and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:45.990" style="s2">and yet coming from from from different</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.339" end="00:08:50.180" style="s2">perspectives and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.990" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">subtle that&#39;s the subtle if that was my</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:57.690" style="s2">criticism is is that is that well that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:09:00.660" style="s2">you you seem to be taking you seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.690" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">pushing forward a conciliatory message</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.660" end="00:09:07.470" style="s2">at the same time you still seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">this this this let&#39;s say for our against</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.470" end="00:09:13.470" style="s2">position that you seem to need to to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">express so can i I said one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.470" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">came up for me was this tension between</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:26.069" style="s2">both and and really you know it was your</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">contention that if you really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.069" end="00:09:32.069" style="s2">be meta modern to really just integrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:33.389" style="s2">you know both perspectives Russell Brand</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.069" end="00:09:34.980" style="s2">and Jordan Peterson&#39;s and then just</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.389" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">allow that to be rather than coming down</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.980" end="00:09:39.690" style="s2">on one side but then also I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:43.980" style="s2">because we obviously you know these</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.690" end="00:09:45.810" style="s2">ideas operate within a context of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.980" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">informing real policy decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.810" end="00:09:51.000" style="s2">affect people&#39;s lives and and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.930" end="00:09:54.029" style="s2">I one of the one of my responses to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.000" end="00:09:55.889" style="s2">over email was you know if we&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.029" end="00:09:57.899" style="s2">ad like okay so there&#39;s a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.889" end="00:09:59.459" style="s2">polarization but we do live in an</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.899" end="00:10:02.610" style="s2">adversarial political climate where</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.459" end="00:10:04.350" style="s2">there is a battle of ideas and and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.610" end="00:10:05.639" style="s2">battle informs policy choices but what</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.350" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">we do in climate change what we do in</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.639" end="00:10:12.810" style="s2">housing policy how we think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">immigration and where is the room while</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.810" end="00:10:18.149" style="s2">still holding an appreciation for other</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:20.519" style="s2">ideas to actually come down on one side</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.149" end="00:10:23.459" style="s2">and actually say no like this this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.519" end="00:10:25.380" style="s2">wrong and we should we shouldn&#39;t listen</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.459" end="00:10:27.980" style="s2">as much to this person as we do and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.380" end="00:10:30.569" style="s2">should remember the virtue and value of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.980" end="00:10:33.149" style="s2">post-modernism or left-wing perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.569" end="00:10:35.490" style="s2">and then a lot of a lot of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.149" end="00:10:37.800" style="s2">lot of people who you know criticized a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.490" end="00:10:39.899" style="s2">lot of let&#39;s say friends in the left who</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.800" end="00:10:41.459" style="s2">criticize my video and the interview I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.899" end="00:10:44.430" style="s2">did with David fuller and Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.459" end="00:10:45.930" style="s2">would say that you&#39;re you&#39;re in giving</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.430" end="00:10:50.490" style="s2">cover - Jordan Peterson you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.930" end="00:10:52.620" style="s2">giving cover - you know the far right or</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.490" end="00:10:54.480" style="s2">who might use his ideas as intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.620" end="00:10:57.420" style="s2">cover for a right-wing agenda that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.480" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">really spreading and growing so I just</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.420" end="00:11:02.370" style="s2">wanted to maybe that was kind of cool he</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.360" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">expressed but I wanted just to bring</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.370" end="00:11:06.420" style="s2">bring that and get your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:11.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.420" end="00:11:13.530" style="s2">Peterson is far right I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.640" end="00:11:15.360" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s no evidence for that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.530" end="00:11:17.250" style="s2">I think there is some evidence that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:18.750" style="s2">a bit of a conservative uh-huh and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.250" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">not a conservative I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.750" end="00:11:26.370" style="s2">felt like a conservative on the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:30.390" style="s2">hand I think that what what he what what</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.370" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">he what he does is he brings people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.390" end="00:11:35.520" style="s2">have a conservative bent let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:37.140" style="s2">conservative to a position that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.520" end="00:11:38.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s more that&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.140" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">reasonable and and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.730" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">centered so I think he&#39;s bringing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:44.400" style="s2">of the wingnuts you know from the far</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:48.890" style="s2">right you know into into a more</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.400" end="00:11:52.680" style="s2">reasonable position he allows me to view</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.890" end="00:11:56.070" style="s2">conservatism traditionalism with with</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.680" end="00:11:57.510" style="s2">more compassion than I did before and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.070" end="00:12:00.440" style="s2">think that&#39;s an interesting one because</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.510" end="00:12:03.060" style="s2">again it&#39;s the it&#39;s the background</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.440" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">context that informs maybe your position</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.060" end="00:12:06.990" style="s2">so to share mine</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">I very much been in the systems change</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.990" end="00:12:13.160" style="s2">space that&#39;s been my the work that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:17.090" style="s2">done that&#39;s been my agenda is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">transitioning from what I would see as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.090" end="00:12:23.700" style="s2">you know a you know for all its virtues</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:27.410" style="s2">and its ability to lift millions out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.700" end="00:12:31.050" style="s2">poverty is still a very extractive</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.410" end="00:12:32.670" style="s2">system and trying to move to something</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.050" end="00:12:38.130" style="s2">that is more fit for purpose for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.670" end="00:12:42.600" style="s2">future and and so I said I suppose maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.130" end="00:12:44.610" style="s2">I see a lot of this these ideas is what</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.600" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">utility they have for my political</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.610" end="00:12:51.720" style="s2">agenda and and that probably does</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:54.930" style="s2">obscure my ability to truly enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.720" end="00:12:56.730" style="s2">liminal space to truly hold an unknowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.930" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">position and to want to maybe Corral</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.730" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">people around a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:02.460" style="s2">perspectives and positions and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:04.050" style="s2">that it may be a penny is just wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.460" end="00:13:07.889" style="s2">me as you speak that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.050" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">implicit in a lot of Pearson&#39;s talks and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.889" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">lectures and debates is this resistance</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.540" end="00:13:16.649" style="s2">to being corralled by a group consensus</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:22.429" style="s2">that might be prevalent at the time</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.649" end="00:13:24.749" style="s2">mm-hmm and that is an embodiment of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.429" end="00:13:26.220" style="s2">kind of the sovereign individual who</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.749" end="00:13:28.410" style="s2">will make up their own mind and will say</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.220" end="00:13:31.649" style="s2">what they think and yeah and I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.410" end="00:13:39.389" style="s2">in a way he is modeling that I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.649" end="00:13:40.799" style="s2">about in a way at least I 62 and there</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.389" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">might be more pathways but one</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.799" end="00:13:45.239" style="s2">traditional political pathway is you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:51.449" style="s2">know it&#39;s a binary it&#39;s left versus</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.239" end="00:13:53.160" style="s2">right years you you know advance your</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.449" end="00:13:57.929" style="s2">ideas as best you can of the political</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.160" end="00:14:01.259" style="s2">space and you affect change and and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.929" end="00:14:04.379" style="s2">when someone comes along from you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.259" end="00:14:06.569" style="s2">even if it&#39;s the moderate right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.379" end="00:14:09.119" style="s2">that feels threatening to those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.569" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">and so you try and dismiss them or take</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.119" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">them down and and then there&#39;s this what</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:17.639" style="s2">feels like a new political space opening</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.790" end="00:14:19.619" style="s2">which is about integrating and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.639" end="00:14:21.149" style="s2">transcending so this kind of approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.619" end="00:14:25.410" style="s2">informed by integral theory or meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.149" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">modernism and the it&#39;s an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.410" end="00:14:31.319" style="s2">really see the virtue of the healthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">expression of the other side so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.319" end="00:14:34.889" style="s2">healthy expression of the masculine on</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.889" end="00:14:43.019" style="s2">and that maybe is there is an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.420" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">that if there is some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.019" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">generosity to the what was considered an</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:50.490" style="s2">opposing perspective that will also be</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:52.649" style="s2">met with generosity and that we might be</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.490" end="00:14:54.749" style="s2">able to find a new space of civic</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.649" end="00:14:57.110" style="s2">dialogue in the middle where our both</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.749" end="00:15:00.269" style="s2">our conversation and our policy choices</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.110" end="00:15:02.549" style="s2">have some sense of balance and the you</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.269" end="00:15:04.259" style="s2">know at a personal level and energetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.549" end="00:15:05.970" style="s2">level of the balance between the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.259" end="00:15:08.489" style="s2">feminine and the masculine on a policy</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.970" end="00:15:11.910" style="s2">level between stage and market and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.489" end="00:15:14.369" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at maybe a what you might</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.910" end="00:15:16.139" style="s2">call a deeper center or a more</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.369" end="00:15:18.470" style="s2">productive center that isn&#39;t just based</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.139" end="00:15:21.210" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.470" end="00:15:22.980" style="s2">wherever like wherever the war of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.210" end="00:15:25.110" style="s2">leaves us on the ideological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.980" end="00:15:31.260" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually actively co-created</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.110" end="00:15:34.170" style="s2">and and participated in and and so my</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.260" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s basically the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.170" end="00:15:41.580" style="s2">assumption that I&#39;ve been following and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:45.420" style="s2">maybe my I have doubts about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.580" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">because even if one side capitulates for</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.420" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">example but we&#39;re not capitulated even</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:51.390" style="s2">if one side really honors and recognizes</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:53.970" style="s2">the virtue of Peters in their virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.390" end="00:15:57.570" style="s2">the right that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:15:59.520" style="s2">that the right will honor and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.570" end="00:16:02.550" style="s2">the virtues of the left actually you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.520" end="00:16:06.060" style="s2">might just be a conventional political</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.550" end="00:16:08.220" style="s2">understanding ceding ground to just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.060" end="00:16:12.030" style="s2">more right-wing understanding in view</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:15.180" style="s2">and so that&#39;s my I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.030" end="00:16:17.640" style="s2">maybe one of my concerns is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.180" end="00:16:19.740" style="s2">know it you can enter into a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.640" end="00:16:23.540" style="s2">and hopefully that would be meshed with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.740" end="00:16:26.580" style="s2">reciprocity but there&#39;s always you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">actors within a political game that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.580" end="00:16:32.370" style="s2">just ruthlessly advancing their</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.110" end="00:16:36.180" style="s2">interests and you know if I am if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.370" end="00:16:39.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say the Koch brothers or if I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.180" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">really advancing a particular right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.420" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">neoliberal agenda it it might entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:48.000" style="s2">play into my game to have this emerging</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.060" end="00:16:50.100" style="s2">ecosystem of people like me and you who</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.000" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">are entering into this integral space</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.100" end="00:16:55.560" style="s2">and honoring the ideas of the right but</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.010" end="00:16:58.380" style="s2">at the same time they advance their</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.560" end="00:17:00.570" style="s2">agenda so that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s a concern</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.380" end="00:17:01.890" style="s2">that I have and I&#39;m very very curious to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.570" end="00:17:03.990" style="s2">get your your thoughts on that well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.890" end="00:17:07.050" style="s2">think what I hear is that you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.990" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">of losing some kind of ground and my</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.050" end="00:17:12.140" style="s2">question would be where is the ground</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:15.180" style="s2">you know I mean is there a ground I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.140" end="00:17:17.939" style="s2">in one in one sense yes there is we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.180" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">a divided brain you know we&#39;re divided</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.939" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">within ourselves we have a left and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">know our left brain functions</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">differently than our right brain so part</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:27.660" style="s2">of us is very protective and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:30.390" style="s2">conservative and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.660" end="00:17:33.930" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t want to step into you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.390" end="00:17:37.050" style="s2">difficult difficult this difficult</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.930" end="00:17:41.340" style="s2">liminal space and and part of a part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.050" end="00:17:42.810" style="s2">us is dying for four you know I think in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.340" end="00:17:44.310" style="s2">one of your talk to you talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.810" end="00:17:47.400" style="s2">know this vulnerability and where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.310" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">feel alive right so so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.400" end="00:17:51.870" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the place to be right</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">the place to be is in this vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.870" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">space where you feel alive it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">to be to be have a fixed agenda or fixed</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:05.310" style="s2">position or a fixed you know point of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.750" end="00:18:07.020" style="s2">view but again I hear what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.310" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re too much in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.020" end="00:18:10.770" style="s2">middle space maybe it all turns to mush</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">and you know you know don&#39;t want to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.770" end="00:18:14.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do or you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:15.930" style="s2">what particular you know if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.760" end="00:18:20.370" style="s2">the political world you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.930" end="00:18:23.460" style="s2">particular you know you know policy to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.370" end="00:18:26.010" style="s2">support well but it&#39;s interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.460" end="00:18:27.570" style="s2">like I think we I think you&#39;re I also</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.010" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">something I hear what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.570" end="00:18:32.010" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for combat and combat is</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:33.660" style="s2">important but combat combat in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.010" end="00:18:35.400" style="s2">of non-violent combat because there has</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.660" end="00:18:38.460" style="s2">to be combat you know there&#39;s a combat</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.400" end="00:18:40.800" style="s2">of nature to to our to our spirit which</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.460" end="00:18:43.740" style="s2">is a thing of beauty and that&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.800" end="00:18:46.920" style="s2">masculinity right which is so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.740" end="00:18:51.570" style="s2">repressed in a conciliatory space right</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.920" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">so so you know combat but you know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.570" end="00:18:58.230" style="s2">hate to over quote Peterson but minimal</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">necessary force right so does that make</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.230" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">sense sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:05.160" style="s2">like what I find often is is in a much</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:10.920" style="s2">of the leftist discussion is this sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.160" end="00:19:12.600" style="s2">of machinist yeah this kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.920" end="00:19:13.860" style="s2">being vulnerable and being open and</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.600" end="00:19:15.750" style="s2">being you know but what if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.860" end="00:19:18.780" style="s2">vulnerable and open to you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.750" end="00:19:21.270" style="s2">gonna crush you right so yes you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.780" end="00:19:23.400" style="s2">your you need your armor but but also</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.270" end="00:19:24.570" style="s2">but also you need to be able to you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.400" end="00:19:26.760" style="s2">you need your armor and you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.570" end="00:19:29.220" style="s2">vulnerable you need to be you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.760" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">samurai in the masculine need a strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.220" end="00:19:33.750" style="s2">masculine force but you also need you</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:35.640" style="s2">know the yogi combines the feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.750" end="00:19:39.540" style="s2">the masculine in one person you also</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.640" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2">need this you know loving tender you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.540" end="00:19:41.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:44.500" style="s2">compassion you know all these you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.320" end="00:19:46.179" style="s2">whatever the feminine is which is often</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.500" end="00:19:48.120" style="s2">you know expressed in cliches right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.179" end="00:19:53.530" style="s2">because the feminine also has a fierce</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.120" end="00:19:55.630" style="s2">element to it but so can we just know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.530" end="00:19:57.580" style="s2">just just because I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:20:00.940" style="s2">something I&#39;d like to to go into in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.580" end="00:20:04.470" style="s2">second but so you said that either you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.940" end="00:20:07.570" style="s2">noticed in me a fear of ceding ground</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.470" end="00:20:10.179" style="s2">the true place to be is in the liminal</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.570" end="00:20:14.620" style="s2">and in the vulnerable and I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.179" end="00:20:16.150" style="s2">I definitely agree with that and I do</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.620" end="00:20:17.890" style="s2">believe that genuine political</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.150" end="00:20:20.669" style="s2">resolution comes from both sides</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.890" end="00:20:24.340" style="s2">entering into that space and actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.669" end="00:20:26.440" style="s2">what wants to emerge comes through both</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.340" end="00:20:29.500" style="s2">being willing to cede their fixed</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.440" end="00:20:33.460" style="s2">positions and the new being born through</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.500" end="00:20:38.169" style="s2">that dialogical process but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.460" end="00:20:40.299" style="s2">time not all actors in the system are</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.169" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">subscribed to that game but subscribed</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.299" end="00:20:46.120" style="s2">to advancing their fixed-point agenda</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:49.960" style="s2">and what I see is a wider phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.120" end="00:20:51.490" style="s2">you can you commit correct you think may</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.960" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">interrupt you though just for a second</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.490" end="00:20:55.630" style="s2">maybe that see the ground is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:57.010" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.630" end="00:20:59.770" style="s2">concerned about what all the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.010" end="00:21:02.940" style="s2">actors are about right or maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.770" end="00:21:06.100" style="s2">just pragmatic you know maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.940" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">political survival I don&#39;t know does</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.100" end="00:21:09.580" style="s2">that make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:11.650" style="s2">well well maybe well maybe I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.580" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">illustrate with an example and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.650" end="00:21:16.330" style="s2">can you can reflect back to me what</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:20.350" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing or what maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.330" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">seeing so I see a a broader phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.350" end="00:21:29.100" style="s2">in the rise of the or Trice of you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:32.980" style="s2">a moral a moral panic about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.100" end="00:21:35.650" style="s2">and an over inflation of the harms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.980" end="00:21:38.140" style="s2">post-modernism a pathologizing of the</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.830" end="00:22:14.950" style="s2">you know I see a very clear correlation</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.950" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">resource scarcity mass migration and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.320" end="00:22:21.400" style="s2">rise of authoritarianism of the loss of</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.400" end="00:22:25.690" style="s2">political game that&#39;s playing out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.650" end="00:22:30.420" style="s2">within that from my perspective at a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.690" end="00:22:30.420" style="s2">time when the left and movements for</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.140" end="00:22:36.310" style="s2">liberalism and for and for greater</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.310" end="00:22:42.130" style="s2">climate change are needed we see what</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.070" end="00:22:44.740" style="s2">feels like a demonization of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.130" end="00:22:46.870" style="s2">forces and yes those forces absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.740" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">need to acknowledge their shadow and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.870" end="00:22:53.890" style="s2">devouring mother that is creating this</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">problem but I&#39;m also just aware of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.890" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">know with someone like Peterson I whose</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:03.550" style="s2">agenda does Peterson support or whose</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:07.600" style="s2">agenda is furthered by by Peterson being</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.550" end="00:23:09.820" style="s2">a being public intellectual and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.600" end="00:23:11.920" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the ground what I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.820" end="00:23:14.310" style="s2">about and I do think it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.920" end="00:23:18.220" style="s2">political survival I do really see a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.310" end="00:23:20.470" style="s2">threat of the the far right being that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.220" end="00:23:24.550" style="s2">the preeminent political force of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.470" end="00:23:26.080" style="s2">21st century yeah but with the far left</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.550" end="00:23:27.820" style="s2">you know they really are they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.080" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2">they&#39;re almost the same beast you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.820" end="00:23:32.800" style="s2">because the more the more the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:36.550" style="s2">far-left pushes that pushes the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.800" end="00:23:39.310" style="s2">buttons of the far right that the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.550" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">polarized those those two groups become</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.310" end="00:23:45.970" style="s2">so this is exactly that the you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:48.040" style="s2">Trump is the exact result of you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.970" end="00:23:50.470" style="s2">this this group of people who were very</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.040" end="00:23:53.710" style="s2">condescending to traditional working</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.470" end="00:23:56.830" style="s2">people right who treated them like</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.710" end="00:23:59.160" style="s2">deplorable human beings and and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.830" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">considered themselves to be superior in</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.160" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">all ways right so so you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.360" end="00:24:10.330" style="s2">these you know so so these the work</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:13.630" style="s2">you know working people need a voice I</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.330" end="00:24:16.420" style="s2">mean and a voice is not an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.630" end="00:24:18.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t need a I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.420" end="00:24:20.290" style="s2">just it&#39;s an energetic thing too as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.730" end="00:24:23.920" style="s2">as an intellectual game you might have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.290" end="00:24:27.130" style="s2">all the right answers but people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.920" end="00:24:29.110" style="s2">vote with their their minds they you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.130" end="00:24:31.570" style="s2">know really I mean do they I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.110" end="00:24:34.540" style="s2">average guy average person yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.570" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">woman and in America are they voting</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.540" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">with with with with intellect no they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">voting with their their guts right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">there&#39;s an integration that that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.030" end="00:24:49.870" style="s2">left and I think Peterson is very</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:51.370" style="s2">helpful to the left he may be even more</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.870" end="00:24:54.790" style="s2">helpful to the left and he used to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.370" end="00:24:58.450" style="s2">right I mean because because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.790" end="00:25:02.860" style="s2">allowing for a lot of people are like</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.450" end="00:25:04.450" style="s2">are left this but they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.860" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">they&#39;re you know they&#39;ve been listening</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.450" end="00:25:07.330" style="s2">to Peterson their land they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:08.620" style="s2">leftist and they&#39;re afraid to tell their</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.330" end="00:25:10.840" style="s2">friends they&#39;re listening to Peters to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.620" end="00:25:12.370" style="s2">them but you know I think I think I</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.840" end="00:25:15.490" style="s2">think he&#39;s helping to integrate maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.370" end="00:25:17.650" style="s2">healthy version of conservatism in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.490" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">culture or giving that a voice as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.650" end="00:25:26.970" style="s2">which is which is necessary you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">yeah I totally see that the Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.970" end="00:25:31.720" style="s2">wasn&#39;t properly received is a gap is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.679" end="00:25:33.370" style="s2">gift for the left because he&#39;s a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.720" end="00:25:35.650" style="s2">to the shadow of the left and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.370" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">by under like being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.650" end="00:25:40.059" style="s2">conversations about for example near the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:42.610" style="s2">archetype of the devouring mother that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.059" end="00:25:43.540" style="s2">the left can actually win more people</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.610" end="00:25:46.330" style="s2">over because at the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.540" end="00:25:48.790" style="s2">unintegrated shadow is basically putting</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.330" end="00:25:51.370" style="s2">people off and then fueling the fire</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.790" end="00:25:53.170" style="s2">right so I have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.370" end="00:25:54.790" style="s2">I want to I have an idea I want I want</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.170" end="00:25:56.650" style="s2">to throw out at you related to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.790" end="00:25:58.510" style="s2">shadow stuff right because everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.650" end="00:26:00.790" style="s2">talking about the shadow right these</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.510" end="00:26:02.620" style="s2">days and I had the idea here I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.790" end="00:26:04.630" style="s2">that okay what is the shadow of the mass</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.620" end="00:26:06.940" style="s2">flame right everybody says it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.630" end="00:26:08.679" style="s2">it&#39;s violence and aggression and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.940" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">know all the terrible things that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.679" end="00:26:15.130" style="s2">know men have done through history and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:17.230" style="s2">so so we the the the outer view is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.130" end="00:26:20.029" style="s2">that the shadow of the masculine is</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.230" end="00:26:22.309" style="s2">aggression right and in and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.029" end="00:26:25.789" style="s2">shadow of the feminine is then is then</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.309" end="00:26:28.609" style="s2">passivity you could say or being</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.789" end="00:26:29.960" style="s2">invisible or or are not stepping up or</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.609" end="00:26:32.330" style="s2">that kind of thing so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.960" end="00:26:33.249" style="s2">passion you have this aggression shadow</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.330" end="00:26:36.019" style="s2">and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.249" end="00:26:37.580" style="s2">passive-aggressive shadow but then I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.019" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">also and then I thought it&#39;s the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.580" end="00:26:42.590" style="s2">right the shadow of the masculine is</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:44.629" style="s2">passive aggression uh-huh is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.590" end="00:26:46.609" style="s2">becoming fully masculine and the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.629" end="00:26:48.830" style="s2">of the of the feminine is aggression</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.609" end="00:26:51.139" style="s2">which you see very much and hitting me</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.830" end="00:26:52.849" style="s2">to movement aggression against men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.139" end="00:26:55.999" style="s2">the part that you don&#39;t want to admit or</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.849" end="00:26:57.349" style="s2">seeing yourself right so women don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.999" end="00:26:58.940" style="s2">want to admit that they have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.349" end="00:27:01.029" style="s2">aggressive aspect to that to their</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.940" end="00:27:06.940" style="s2">natures and men don&#39;t want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.029" end="00:27:13.609" style="s2">men don&#39;t men become men men have this I</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.940" end="00:27:15.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know I men have this what men have</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.609" end="00:27:17.479" style="s2">this tendency to vacillate it and not</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.320" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">you know fully embody their masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.479" end="00:27:23.749" style="s2">and and and and and and even their</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:26.629" style="s2">aggression so so anyway that was just</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.749" end="00:27:28.580" style="s2">something I was thinking about which I</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.629" end="00:27:33.379" style="s2">wanted to fill I mean I totally I did</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.580" end="00:27:35.089" style="s2">I totally I I see both and I see it in</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.379" end="00:27:37.820" style="s2">myself you know can you can you fully</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.089" end="00:27:40.700" style="s2">step into an own and express your maths</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.820" end="00:27:43.969" style="s2">and power in the world and to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.700" end="00:27:46.339" style="s2">degree given the prevailing culture do</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.969" end="00:27:48.710" style="s2">we feel a hyper self-consciousness about</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.339" end="00:27:51.769" style="s2">that because it&#39;s associated with Turney</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.710" end="00:27:53.809" style="s2">and I was aggression and despite that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.769" end="00:27:56.619" style="s2">can you still stand in your truth and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.809" end="00:28:01.249" style="s2">stand on your power and and express that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.619" end="00:28:04.009" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s yeah I really</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.249" end="00:28:05.690" style="s2">resonate with that and I also um I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.009" end="00:28:07.460" style="s2">encouraged well at least I can only</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.690" end="00:28:10.820" style="s2">speak from our high circles but more and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.460" end="00:28:14.149" style="s2">more I&#39;m seeing a willingness to speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.820" end="00:28:21.889" style="s2">about the shadow feminine and the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.149" end="00:28:23.749" style="s2">ways in which women you know can be</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.889" end="00:28:25.159" style="s2">manipulative er can deceive or can</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.749" end="00:28:27.289" style="s2">display aggression and how that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.159" end="00:28:30.999" style="s2">showing off in the me to conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.289" end="00:28:33.650" style="s2">for example I don&#39;t know if you saw the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.999" end="00:28:36.460" style="s2">the video the camera</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:39.680" style="s2">me which was a series of women</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.460" end="00:28:41.930" style="s2">apologizing to men for aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.680" end="00:28:43.610" style="s2">shadowing of her and you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.930" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">there was you know there was criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.610" end="00:28:47.270" style="s2">that video of you know you can apologize</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:50.090" style="s2">on behalf of the gender to another</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.270" end="00:28:52.340" style="s2">gender you can only own what you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.090" end="00:28:53.780" style="s2">personally but there was I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.340" end="00:28:58.550" style="s2">interesting in that it marked a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.780" end="00:29:02.870" style="s2">the conversation you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.550" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">prevailing cultural understanding is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.870" end="00:29:11.540" style="s2">know men have done wrong and women are</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:13.400" style="s2">the victims of that yeah have to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.540" end="00:29:15.350" style="s2">beyond victimology as being the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.400" end="00:29:17.000" style="s2">know there are real victims but you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.350" end="00:29:24.500" style="s2">to go beyond victimology as being the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.000" end="00:29:26.660" style="s2">first impulse uh-huh and and and self</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.500" end="00:29:31.660" style="s2">responsibility on both sides you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.660" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">meant masculine side and feminine side</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.660" end="00:29:39.080" style="s2">I&#39;m curious too</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:41.420" style="s2">do you have that&#39;s so do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.080" end="00:29:43.190" style="s2">sense that a genuine resolution is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.420" end="00:29:46.760" style="s2">possible or obviously there will always</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.190" end="00:29:49.280" style="s2">be tensions and conflict within you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.760" end="00:29:51.620" style="s2">large scale systems and societies over</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.280" end="00:29:55.430" style="s2">ideas but do you feel like there could</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.620" end="00:29:57.940" style="s2">be the birth of this more integrated</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.430" end="00:30:00.860" style="s2">center where you know you even have</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.940" end="00:30:02.990" style="s2">political parties that are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.860" end="00:30:05.720" style="s2">institutional embodiment of being able</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.990" end="00:30:08.060" style="s2">to hold the masculine and the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.720" end="00:30:10.460" style="s2">attack on a cultural level be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.060" end="00:30:13.970" style="s2">honor left and right wing ideas and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.460" end="00:30:17.270" style="s2">would gather eyes enough people around</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.970" end="00:30:19.880" style="s2">that to keep maybe leave more on</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.270" end="00:30:22.130" style="s2">integrated extremes of the left and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.880" end="00:30:24.740" style="s2">right or the unintegrated extremes of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.130" end="00:30:26.270" style="s2">masculine feminine at bay and that there</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.740" end="00:30:29.710" style="s2">would be a kind of a center that could</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.270" end="00:30:35.780" style="s2">hold us you do have confidence in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.710" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">confidence know a certain amount of hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.780" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.660" end="00:30:50.120" style="s2">I I think that I think you to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.390" end="00:30:52.820" style="s2">kind of utopianism is dangerous um</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.120" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">because you&#39;re living for the future</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.820" end="00:30:59.990" style="s2">more than you&#39;re living you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">appreciating you know the complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.990" end="00:31:06.890" style="s2">messiness of the of the current</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:08.910" style="s2">situation so so I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.890" end="00:31:10.680" style="s2">resolution is what we should be looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.910" end="00:31:12.750" style="s2">for you know I don&#39;t think we should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.680" end="00:31:16.290" style="s2">looking for resolution I think we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.750" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">be looking to be become more alive and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.290" end="00:31:22.980" style="s2">embodied as people and and have more</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:26.250" style="s2">meaningful lives so so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.980" end="00:31:29.220" style="s2">hold out much hope for any collective</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.250" end="00:31:31.290" style="s2">again I guess that makes me a Peter</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.220" end="00:31:34.290" style="s2">Sounion in some sense is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.290" end="00:31:36.450" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual but i but</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.290" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">i but I also think that I also think</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.450" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">that society organically grows towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:48.060" style="s2">that does that make any sense we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:50.220" style="s2">say a bit more I was with you into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.060" end="00:31:52.380" style="s2">last sentence and you said society</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.220" end="00:31:56.670" style="s2">organic he grows towards that well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.380" end="00:31:58.800" style="s2">think that there&#39;s there is you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.670" end="00:32:05.730" style="s2">think I think that there&#39;s an organic</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.800" end="00:32:07.920" style="s2">growth of of society that happens at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.730" end="00:32:10.830" style="s2">same time as it falls apart like the two</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.920" end="00:32:12.300" style="s2">are so simultaneously happening so it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.830" end="00:32:12.810" style="s2">gets worse and worse and worse and worse</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.300" end="00:32:15.690" style="s2">and worse</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.810" end="00:32:17.250" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this sort of light</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.690" end="00:32:18.630" style="s2">shining in the darkness that gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.250" end="00:32:20.780" style="s2">brighter and brighter and brighter and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.630" end="00:32:20.780" style="s2">brighter</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.870" end="00:32:28.650" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean that resonates I see</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.300" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">the the seeds of that emerging or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.650" end="00:32:34.760" style="s2">know the source code of that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.330" end="00:32:41.430" style="s2">and maybe it just so happens that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.670" end="00:32:43.020" style="s2">has more airtime or feels louder you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.430" end="00:32:45.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s more of the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.020" end="00:32:46.860" style="s2">institutions and kind of mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.210" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">ecological figures or maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.860" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">embodiment of that like Trump being an</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">example but then you also have this</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:57.210" style="s2">emerging in yeah point of integration</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:59.790" style="s2">and I think this is I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.210" end="00:33:03.630" style="s2">interesting is that it feels very</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.790" end="00:33:07.230" style="s2">mystical and very spiritual in at its</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.630" end="00:33:11.220" style="s2">core that it is this very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.230" end="00:33:14.460" style="s2">personal process of understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.220" end="00:33:16.650" style="s2">ways in which you need to grow in order</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.460" end="00:33:20.220" style="s2">to see with greater clarity the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.650" end="00:33:21.510" style="s2">complexity of what&#39;s happening to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.220" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">able to meet people with greater empathy</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.510" end="00:33:29.370" style="s2">to be able to forge something that works</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:32.150" style="s2">better on a more complex level so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.370" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">this this like phrase the personal is</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.150" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">political I think is taking them to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:41.940" style="s2">meaning in in this time that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah this is okay I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.940" end="00:33:45.420" style="s2">trying to understand what Metta</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:49.550" style="s2">modernism is and I understand that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.420" end="00:33:53.310" style="s2">work with many modernist concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.550" end="00:33:55.770" style="s2">and I think the one of the ideas of meta</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.310" end="00:33:58.590" style="s2">modernism is that this integrate include</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.770" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">the include idea is its its political</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.590" end="00:34:09.540" style="s2">and i-i-i don&#39;t think how do i say this</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:12.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it starts from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.540" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">political I think it starts from the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.600" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">the trance the inner transformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.360" end="00:34:22.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t think societies you know like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.940" style="s2">this this idea I guess there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.350" end="00:34:26.370" style="s2">economist named shoemaker who had this</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.940" end="00:34:29.940" style="s2">book called small as beautiful and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.370" end="00:34:33.780" style="s2">idea that so it starts very small I went</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.940" end="00:34:34.980" style="s2">to yeah I know just to say that I went</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.780" end="00:34:37.560" style="s2">to Schumacher College they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.980" end="00:34:39.240" style="s2">influenced by oh yeah yeah well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.560" end="00:34:41.429" style="s2">that this phrase works for me it makes</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.240" end="00:34:43.590" style="s2">sense to me because a real community is</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.429" end="00:34:45.120" style="s2">small it can&#39;t be big right because as</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.590" end="00:34:46.770" style="s2">soon as something gets too big it loses</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.120" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2">its it&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.770" end="00:34:51.780" style="s2">contours there&#39;s there&#39;s no intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.929" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">between people so so that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.780" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">actually that&#39;s where I have if I have</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">hope or something it would be in small</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:02.310" style="s2">communities not in big social movements</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:05.250" style="s2">III distrust maybe it&#39;s my personality I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.310" end="00:35:07.280" style="s2">distrust big big social movements but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.250" end="00:35:09.990" style="s2">think if you have a lot of small</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:13.830" style="s2">movements which are spiritually grounded</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.990" end="00:35:19.320" style="s2">and intelligent then then that lifts the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.830" end="00:35:21.330" style="s2">society up and yeah well the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.320" end="00:35:22.830" style="s2">I wanted to say is that I think that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.330" end="00:35:27.030" style="s2">to be expressed maybe in mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.830" end="00:35:29.190" style="s2">terms in the arts as well so there has</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.030" end="00:35:30.450" style="s2">to be it has to happen on all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.190" end="00:35:31.950" style="s2">levels right it has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.450" end="00:35:34.230" style="s2">simultaneously on all kinds of levels</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.950" end="00:35:35.670" style="s2">and for me the political is the last</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.230" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">level so I was surprised at MIT and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.670" end="00:35:39.600" style="s2">modernist as a sort of emphasis in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:42.590" style="s2">political freak because for me I always</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.600" end="00:35:49.980" style="s2">think of the political sort of the last</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.590" end="00:35:52.190" style="s2">yeah level but yeah I think that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.980" end="00:35:54.600" style="s2">like my understanding from working with</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.190" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">meta modernists and being a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.600" end="00:36:03.390" style="s2">conversation is yeah the key idea is</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:06.630" style="s2">that personal growth through personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.390" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">development is the route to a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.630" end="00:36:10.440" style="s2">strong and stable Society so it is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:12.330" style="s2">much beginning with the eye but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.440" end="00:36:14.340" style="s2">acknowledging that the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.330" end="00:36:17.310" style="s2">those ideas take wholes are at a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.340" end="00:36:20.190" style="s2">cultural level and that the way there</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.310" end="00:36:21.870" style="s2">may be reinforced supported is by policy</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.190" end="00:36:23.160" style="s2">and political institutions and so they</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.870" end="00:36:26.100" style="s2">would be like for example one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.160" end="00:36:29.850" style="s2">core ideas is this idea of welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.100" end="00:36:33.270" style="s2">2.0 which isn&#39;t just providing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.850" end="00:36:34.680" style="s2">a material security it&#39;s also assisting</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.770" end="00:39:23.740" style="s2">personal growth camps or whatever you</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.930" end="00:39:33.690" style="s2">process and I would be afraid that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.910" end="00:39:37.780" style="s2">would be corrupted by too much</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.690" end="00:39:40.359" style="s2">institutionalization but then you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.780" end="00:39:45.640" style="s2">at the same time if we think like</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.359" end="00:39:47.770" style="s2">personal growth has always been</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.640" end="00:39:49.480" style="s2">emphasized maybe not in the in its</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.770" end="00:39:52.270" style="s2">Dilbert kind of spiritual connotation</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.480" end="00:39:54.760" style="s2">now but like the whole idea of character</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.270" end="00:39:56.619" style="s2">development of certain values being in</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.760" end="00:39:59.349" style="s2">stairs and populations it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.619" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s entirely coercive that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.349" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">a society on some level deciding how it</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">wants to condition itself and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:08.410" style="s2">process is happening regardless and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.540" style="s2">the question is what does agency looked</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.410" end="00:40:12.339" style="s2">like within it like how can we promote a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.540" end="00:40:14.040" style="s2">set of values at a collective level that</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.339" end="00:40:16.900" style="s2">are about personal growth and that also</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.040" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">really emphasizes twenty of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.900" end="00:40:21.490" style="s2">individual to question that process that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.420" end="00:40:23.380" style="s2">like really emphasizes critical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.490" end="00:40:25.990" style="s2">and a rebellious spirit or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.380" end="00:40:28.750" style="s2">might be so I don&#39;t think we can lower</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.990" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">age collective conditioning we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.750" end="00:40:31.470" style="s2">it you know we&#39;re doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:35.050" style="s2">self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.470" end="00:40:38.050" style="s2">collective way regardless and yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.050" end="00:40:40.380" style="s2">are a collective beings I mean most of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.050" end="00:40:43.510" style="s2">us we believe that we&#39;re individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.380" end="00:40:46.839" style="s2">you know if we really examined our mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.510" end="00:40:51.880" style="s2">a you know we&#39;re governed by super-ego</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.839" end="00:40:54.099" style="s2">of the society and I think real</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.880" end="00:40:56.140" style="s2">collective growth is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.099" end="00:41:00.730" style="s2">developing something but it&#39;s also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.140" end="00:41:06.069" style="s2">also dismantling that collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.730" end="00:41:09.099" style="s2">coercion so just an idea that has come</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.069" end="00:41:12.579" style="s2">to me now I&#39;m really in this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.099" end="00:41:14.770" style="s2">collective super-ego and I haven&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.579" end="00:41:19.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t really heard of this as a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.770" end="00:41:21.869" style="s2">and and it makes a lot of sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.540" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">way that our own privates super-ego</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.869" end="00:41:25.690" style="s2">restrains us with</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">a kind of a barrage of thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.690" end="00:41:30.970" style="s2">keeps us in our box that happens in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:32.770" style="s2">collective level and it feels like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.970" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">of the commentary in the online space is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.770" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">about the devouring mother collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:42.760" style="s2">super-ego you know this particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.690" end="00:41:44.799" style="s2">censorship this kind of crowd-sourced</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.760" end="00:41:46.329" style="s2">collective censorship of ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.799" end="00:41:47.950" style="s2">thoughts and the way you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.329" end="00:41:51.180" style="s2">think about climate change or the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.950" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">patriarchy or whatever well equally I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.180" end="00:41:58.920" style="s2">and I wonder whether there&#39;s one coming</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:42:01.299" style="s2">from the tyrannical folder of you know</p>

<p begin="00:45:17.720" end="00:45:21.410" style="s2">amazing how many castration cults there</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.849" end="00:45:23.900" style="s2">there were in these ancient societies</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.410" end="00:45:27.619" style="s2">and I was thinking when it went when a</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.900" end="00:45:30.080" style="s2">lot of the the media operates and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.619" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">Twitter operates as a sort of castration</p>

<p begin="00:45:43.550" end="00:45:49.630" style="s2">you end up becoming very small and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.750" end="00:45:55.090" style="s2">and very limited in your expression and</p>

<p begin="00:45:55.090" end="00:46:01.510" style="s2">totally hear that and then I think the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.359" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2">the impulse behind that I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.510" end="00:46:06.280" style="s2">there&#39;s probably there&#39;s definitely a</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.280" end="00:46:13.570" style="s2">that is protective so that if certain</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.890" end="00:46:32.410" style="s2">that and you know as we&#39;re yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.040" end="00:46:35.080" style="s2">just acknowledging the virtue behind</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.410" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">that or the at least in the prevalent</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.329" end="00:52:29.709" style="s2">you know I guess the whole entire</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.660" end="00:52:31.509" style="s2">political dialogue process etc is is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.709" end="00:52:37.299" style="s2">about that it&#39;s about meeting in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.509" end="00:52:39.130" style="s2">in-between space right yeah and and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.299" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s the only place where</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.130" end="00:52:46.599" style="s2">something generative really happens yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:50.769" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re just in our corner and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.599" end="00:52:58.390" style="s2">angry you pissed off or just just shut</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.769" end="00:52:59.829" style="s2">down yeah yeah it reminds me of that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.390" end="00:53:01.630" style="s2">know there&#39;s different models for</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.829" end="00:53:06.849" style="s2">different levels of listening there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.630" end="00:53:08.529" style="s2">the you know pure not listening where</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.849" end="00:53:12.939" style="s2">you&#39;re just sticking with your fixed</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.529" end="00:53:14.380" style="s2">viewpoint and rejecting and and and not</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.939" end="00:53:16.989" style="s2">acknowledging either the other coast are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.380" end="00:53:18.999" style="s2">their ideas and then there&#39;s listening</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.989" end="00:53:20.499" style="s2">it at the level of debate where I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.999" end="00:53:21.910" style="s2">share my thoughts you share your</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.499" end="00:53:23.739" style="s2">thoughts will trash them out but</p>

<p begin="00:53:23.739" end="00:53:28.749" style="s2">then there&#39;s dialogue where were in some</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.619" end="00:53:30.509" style="s2">level and a process of synthesis which</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.749" end="00:53:34.269" style="s2">maybe I feel it&#39;s what we&#39;re displaying</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.509" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">here to greater an answer expense but</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.269" end="00:53:39.369" style="s2">then the level below that is presencing</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.749" style="s2">and that actually both of us in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.369" end="00:53:43.869" style="s2">of a this is maybe more of like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.749" end="00:53:47.519" style="s2">bohmian dialogue where we are feeling</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.989" end="00:54:05.140" style="s2">neither your idea of my idea it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.349" end="00:54:21.299" style="s2">get to the presence of things</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.670" end="00:54:42.130" style="s2">so do you feel maybe what&#39;s alive from</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.070" end="00:54:52.240" style="s2">for you now having we arrived at that</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.130" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">place I think that this is a positive</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.240" end="00:54:59.770" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s but there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:02.170" style="s2">for me always because it maybe it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.770" end="00:55:05.980" style="s2">because of my personality there there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:25.990" style="s2">unfolding and that yeah that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:59:25.990" end="00:59:29.619" style="s2">space and and that&#39;s what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">have to keep doing or we&#39;re gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.619" end="00:59:34.270" style="s2">you know we&#39;re just beginning to become</p>

<p begin="00:59:53.069" end="00:59:57.400" style="s2">uncomfortable space right so I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.809" end="00:59:58.020" style="s2">same way as you I feel that talking to</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.400" end="01:00:01.030" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.020" end="01:00:03.790" style="s2">III I do feel I&#39;m entering into a</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.030" end="01:00:05.650" style="s2">discomfort of some kind because you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.790" end="01:00:06.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t know you and one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.650" end="01:00:11.770" style="s2">coming up for me is that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.880" end="01:00:14.579" style="s2">invited to give a talk in Vienna in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.770" end="01:00:17.230" style="s2">couple of weeks time on vulnerability in</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.579" end="01:00:25.869" style="s2">21st century politics something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.230" end="01:00:29.079" style="s2">that and and in many ways our</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.869" end="01:00:33.780" style="s2">conversation is validating that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.079" end="01:00:36.730" style="s2">hypothesis that if we genuinely want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.780" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">produce something new and not recreate</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.730" end="01:00:40.089" style="s2">old patterns that we have to enter into</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:44.710" style="s2">this vulnerable space together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.089" end="01:00:51.609" style="s2">kind of the maybe the core of it but</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.710" end="01:00:53.290" style="s2">then my question is is a lot of but a</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.609" end="01:00:55.690" style="s2">lot of vulnerability is whether people</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.290" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">are ready for it you know like I could</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.690" end="01:01:01.270" style="s2">be really vulnerable and in this record</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:03.010" style="s2">talk about all of my really deep dark</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.270" end="01:01:04.750" style="s2">shadows the kind of things that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.010" end="01:01:06.820" style="s2">tell anyone about and I think that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.750" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t go down well with most</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.820" end="01:01:12.730" style="s2">people and I would destroy my reputation</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:15.460" style="s2">and so in a political environment there</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.730" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">is a reason why we we keep to a script</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.460" end="01:01:20.680" style="s2">the script is and reference to what the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">collective super-ego decides is normal</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.680" end="01:01:28.330" style="s2">and okay and and so what I&#39;m sitting</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:31.300" style="s2">with is whether you know vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.330" end="01:01:33.790" style="s2">which has become this trend in you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.300" end="01:01:39.430" style="s2">the kind of the the Brene brown and</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.790" end="01:01:42.790" style="s2">zeitgeist in spiritual circles whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.430" end="01:01:45.070" style="s2">it has what how no how does that relate</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.790" end="01:01:48.310" style="s2">to politics so it&#39;s only to say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.070" end="01:01:50.170" style="s2">that&#39;s I would love if you had a yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.310" end="01:01:52.720" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you brought that up because</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.170" end="01:01:54.190" style="s2">because I had a resistance to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.720" end="01:01:56.530" style="s2">speaking of you know a couple times</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.190" end="01:01:58.990" style="s2">about vulnerability without also</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.530" end="01:02:01.030" style="s2">speaking about toughness because again I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.990" end="01:02:04.089" style="s2">I think it&#39;s this emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.030" end="01:02:09.520" style="s2">feminine so we have to be tough and</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.089" end="01:02:15.420" style="s2">vulnerable I think I mean and toughness</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:20.680" style="s2">might not be you know that in vogue but</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.420" end="01:02:23.950" style="s2">and you know I don&#39;t Varner ability is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.680" end="01:02:27.880" style="s2">not necessarily a a confession it might</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.950" end="01:02:31.300" style="s2">just be not be stepping out of the mask</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.880" end="01:02:34.210" style="s2">right the persona and just just being</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.300" end="01:02:38.080" style="s2">there right you know being really really</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.210" end="01:02:40.180" style="s2">there you know which you can feel so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.080" end="01:02:41.980" style="s2">can be on the script or off the script</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.180" end="01:02:44.440" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not really the point the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.980" end="01:02:47.260" style="s2">is is the language of languaging or the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.440" end="01:02:49.570" style="s2">words it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the presence behind</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.260" end="01:02:51.230" style="s2">the language in the words because words</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.570" end="01:02:54.109" style="s2">are limited</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.230" end="01:02:56.119" style="s2">hmm and I think that&#39;s a I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.109" end="01:02:59.180" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe my sense is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.119" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">what people are yearning for is to feel</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.180" end="01:03:05.300" style="s2">the presence of public figures to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">able to feel them and in a way Trump is</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.300" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">a facsimile of that you he is very</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:14.390" style="s2">visceral he does depart from the script</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:15.890" style="s2">and you do feel him but maybe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.390" end="01:03:18.680" style="s2">question around whether that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.890" end="01:03:21.400" style="s2">coming from an authentic presence inside</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.680" end="01:03:24.020" style="s2">ember from something else well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.400" end="01:03:27.079" style="s2">he&#39;s like the ugliest man in the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.020" end="01:03:29.900" style="s2">which is kind of interesting like its</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.079" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">cousin because it&#39;s like to see that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.900" end="01:03:36.440" style="s2">right I have a suspicion that you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:39.050" style="s2">of course I don&#39;t support Trump and</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.440" end="01:03:41.060" style="s2">practically anything that he is or says</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.050" end="01:03:47.390" style="s2">or does but I have a suspicion that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.060" end="01:03:49.700" style="s2">that the Trump is is Trump is the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.390" end="01:03:51.680" style="s2">himself it&#39;s like coming out and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.700" end="01:03:55.849" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s important that he&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.680" end="01:03:58.040" style="s2">for people to see that which is not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.849" end="01:04:01.730" style="s2">political statement you know of any kind</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.040" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">of it but it but it allows it it allows</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.730" end="01:04:07.609" style="s2">it it&#39;s kind of smashed all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:10.670" style="s2">constructions that we have puppy I</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.609" end="01:04:13.010" style="s2">remember very feeling very much when he</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.670" end="01:04:15.230" style="s2">was elected that the world that Mike</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.010" end="01:04:18.020" style="s2">whatever I&#39;ve constructed as my reality</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.230" end="01:04:19.670" style="s2">is no longer that that&#39;s it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.020" end="01:04:23.150" style="s2">the same it&#39;s something it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.670" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">something different so sorry if you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.150" end="01:04:27.980" style="s2">if you if you have the guts to look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:30.380" style="s2">that it can be valuable right rather</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.980" end="01:04:33.230" style="s2">than just you know being reactive</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.380" end="01:04:35.869" style="s2">yeah even even even speaking of even</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.230" end="01:04:38.060" style="s2">speaking of his even saying his name is</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.869" end="01:04:39.650" style="s2">almost like it&#39;s like a curse of some</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.060" end="01:04:43.420" style="s2">kind it&#39;s like you feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.650" end="01:04:46.310" style="s2">cursed right to be talking about him</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.420" end="01:04:47.839" style="s2">like I said I remember before I selected</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.310" end="01:04:50.270" style="s2">don&#39;t even talk about him don&#39;t say his</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.839" end="01:04:52.970" style="s2">name to say that name is a curse it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.270" end="01:04:55.670" style="s2">curse but it&#39;s but it&#39;s but it&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.970" end="01:04:57.770" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely valuable to look at that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.670" end="01:05:00.940" style="s2">you know that&#39;s again I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.770" end="01:05:04.099" style="s2">about whatever damage he&#39;s doing or</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.940" end="01:05:04.700" style="s2">whatever but he&#39;s he&#39;s the pathological</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.099" end="01:05:08.420" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.700" end="01:05:13.369" style="s2">you know and he&#39;s the non man man he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.420" end="01:05:19.430" style="s2">he&#39;s in that void you know that he</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.369" end="01:05:22.040" style="s2">creates you know new things can kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.430" end="01:05:26.829" style="s2">emerge out of whatever he&#39;s destroying I</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.040" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">think was a radical thing to say look</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.829" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">well maybe I think what&#39;s missing like</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:36.410" style="s2">on one level it&#39;s the it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:38.630" style="s2">personification of the tyrannical father</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.410" end="01:05:41.690" style="s2">and it gives people a way of localizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.630" end="01:05:45.619" style="s2">a wider maybe a set of wider concerns</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.690" end="01:05:46.849" style="s2">about that we have but it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.619" end="01:05:49.460" style="s2">that though it&#39;s it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.849" end="01:05:51.589" style="s2">tyrannical its ugliness I want to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.460" end="01:05:58.130" style="s2">further than tyrannical it&#39;s ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.589" end="01:05:59.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like you know so I am but</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.130" end="01:06:04.180" style="s2">you know my theory of this and you press</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.510" end="01:06:06.290" style="s2">that this he he&#39;s the creation of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.180" end="01:06:10.430" style="s2">progressivism as much as he is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.290" end="01:06:12.650" style="s2">creation of he&#39;s the creation of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.430" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">left and the right he&#39;s just he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.650" end="01:06:16.819" style="s2">like saying okay is this the world you</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:20.960" style="s2">want people you know you know wait wait</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.819" end="01:06:25.010" style="s2">wake the up I suppose maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.960" end="01:06:27.770" style="s2">wondering whether you would agree with</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.010" end="01:06:29.930" style="s2">the sense that ultimately Trump is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.770" end="01:06:32.770" style="s2">mirror to all of those qualities that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.930" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">have within us and that we you know we</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.770" end="01:06:40.819" style="s2">we are horrified by travel and yet Trump</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:44.119" style="s2">is the Western shadow and that on all of</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.819" end="01:06:46.099" style="s2">those tendencies lie dormant within us</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.119" end="01:06:49.310" style="s2">if like if you know that that that would</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.099" end="01:06:50.839" style="s2">be a you know a perspective from shadow</p>

<p begin="01:07:32.440" end="01:07:37.210" style="s2">and very who speaks very well and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.620" end="01:07:39.910" style="s2">like you were saying I think before that</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.210" end="01:07:43.870" style="s2">that that you see a lot of these empty</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.910" end="01:07:47.500" style="s2">shells walking around and and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.870" end="01:07:48.760" style="s2">have any you don&#39;t have any feeling for</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.500" end="01:07:51.160" style="s2">them you know at least you get a feeling</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.760" end="01:07:53.830" style="s2">come from at least Trump makes people</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.160" end="01:07:55.300" style="s2">feel on some level yeah which was I</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.830" end="01:07:57.010" style="s2">think you know I mean it&#39;s a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.300" end="01:08:03.760" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s it&#39;s good didn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.010" end="01:08:05.830" style="s2">Trump is making people feel I have good</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:10.300" style="s2">well I&#39;m really I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.830" end="01:08:13.120" style="s2">take away from me is the your media</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.300" end="01:08:15.390" style="s2">impression that the the overemphasis of</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.120" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">vulnerability and not emphasizing</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.390" end="01:08:21.750" style="s2">toughness and that has the virtue and</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:24.759" style="s2">that maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of been a</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.750" end="01:08:27.990" style="s2">something that has helped click into</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.759" end="01:08:30.520" style="s2">place where vulnerability is an asset</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.990" end="01:08:32.109" style="s2">but also if it isn&#39;t a company by</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.520" end="01:08:33.730" style="s2">toughness then it just seems a bit too</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.109" end="01:08:36.160" style="s2">soft and something that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.730" end="01:08:37.480" style="s2">substance and you need both right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.160" end="01:08:39.040" style="s2">when it really it can be very</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.480" end="01:08:42.430" style="s2">manipulative too right</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.040" end="01:08:46.210" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m being vulnerable and take care</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.430" end="01:08:48.910" style="s2">of me and I love me and look at and you</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.210" end="01:08:51.040" style="s2">know so I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.910" end="01:08:52.839" style="s2">mean by vulnerability though I think we</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.040" end="01:08:54.279" style="s2">need something else I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.839" end="01:08:57.880" style="s2">place where vulnerability and toughness</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.279" end="01:08:59.290" style="s2">meet and that&#39;s I think vulnerability is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.880" end="01:09:00.759" style="s2">toughness in a way because you have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.290" end="01:09:07.240" style="s2">be tough to be vulnerable you have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.759" end="01:09:10.630" style="s2">you know you have to be there well what</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.240" end="01:09:14.470" style="s2">I just wanted me to leave you with is</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.630" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">that the vulnerability so that so one</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.470" end="01:09:17.589" style="s2">interesting article I can send it on to</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">you afterwards is Jules evidence I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.589" end="01:09:22.330" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve really with his writing</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:24.509" style="s2">his posture in the UK and he talks about</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.330" end="01:09:27.329" style="s2">the or he&#39;s written about the shadow</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.509" end="01:09:29.190" style="s2">vulnerability and this idea of being a</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.329" end="01:09:34.289" style="s2">status play within certain communities</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.190" end="01:09:37.019" style="s2">and in being a you know way of never or</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.289" end="01:09:39.089" style="s2">all TED Talks have the vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.019" end="01:09:42.750" style="s2">moment at some point oh you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.089" end="01:09:45.509" style="s2">marketing it&#39;s a marketing ploy to but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.750" end="01:09:47.609" style="s2">the genuine vulnerability you know where</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.509" end="01:09:49.079" style="s2">you genuinely feel vulnerable you feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.609" end="01:09:54.389" style="s2">like the ground beneath you isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.079" end="01:09:58.199" style="s2">sellers and that in a way that that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.389" end="01:10:01.159" style="s2">the true honoring of of reality and of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.199" end="01:10:04.110" style="s2">the complexity of a situation and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.159" end="01:10:06.210" style="s2">political leaders do us a great service</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.110" end="01:10:09.480" style="s2">when they can be vulnerable and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.210" end="01:10:12.239" style="s2">acknowledge actually this this situation</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.480" end="01:10:14.699" style="s2">that we&#39;re in doesn&#39;t conform to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.239" end="01:10:17.340" style="s2">narrative that we have about us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.699" end="01:10:20.099" style="s2">actually it&#39;s much more confusing and</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.340" end="01:10:22.320" style="s2">complex but my question is the degree to</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.099" end="01:10:24.179" style="s2">which the public at large has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.320" end="01:10:25.619" style="s2">tolerance level of uncertainty because</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.179" end="01:10:28.260" style="s2">it is something it&#39;s impossible you have</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.619" end="01:10:31.460" style="s2">to work well when you say vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.260" end="01:10:36.260" style="s2">I I what came up for me is truth right</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.460" end="01:10:40.289" style="s2">you know so so so you know politicians I</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.260" end="01:10:42.409" style="s2">guess I guess that&#39;s what vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.289" end="01:10:46.710" style="s2">would be for a politician it would be to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.409" end="01:10:49.800" style="s2">risk risk telling the truth in certain</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.710" end="01:10:53.670" style="s2">situations right where where one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.800" end="01:10:56.670" style="s2">reputation might be at stake and but but</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.670" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">the truth would supersede the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.670" end="01:11:05.639" style="s2">reputation and and it would supersede</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.920" end="01:11:08.670" style="s2">the you know whatever kind of you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.639" end="01:11:12.840" style="s2">manipulation you know that that needs to</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.670" end="01:11:16.170" style="s2">be done which may be idealistic but well</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.840" end="01:11:18.210" style="s2">yeah you or the politics place but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.170" end="01:11:23.099" style="s2">think one durability is true its embody</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.210" end="01:11:24.150" style="s2">truth right I don&#39;t think it you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.099" end="01:11:26.309" style="s2">and then there&#39;s you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.150" end="01:11:31.400" style="s2">manipulative mask of vulnerability which</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.309" end="01:11:36.989" style="s2">can be very dangerous but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.400" end="01:11:37.889" style="s2">real truth no no no go ahead this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.989" end="01:11:41.039" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.889" end="01:11:43.530" style="s2">a lot of what you&#39;re saying I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.039" end="01:11:46.550" style="s2">the degree to which she read pana rent</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.530" end="01:11:49.289" style="s2">or her thinking and writing as</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.550" end="01:11:50.820" style="s2">influenced you advocate as she is</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.289" end="01:11:52.769" style="s2">someone that speaks about both the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.820" end="01:11:57.749" style="s2">dangers of totalitarianism but also the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.769" end="01:11:59.789" style="s2">function of embodied truth and sneaking</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.749" end="01:12:01.919" style="s2">into the public forum from this place</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.789" end="01:12:04.229" style="s2">and then happened as a renewal just</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.919" end="01:12:07.979" style="s2">curious the degree to which yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.229" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve read I&#39;ve really depreciated her a</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.979" end="01:12:14.599" style="s2">little I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I&#39;ve read more and more</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.459" end="01:12:26.669" style="s2">errant is more of a political</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.320" end="01:12:28.289" style="s2">philosopher but but yeah the what does</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.669" end="01:12:30.030" style="s2">their big the banality of evil or is</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.289" end="01:12:33.389" style="s2">that a big hair big in her big phrase</p>

<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:39.269" style="s2">there&#39;s all these masks who present that</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.469" end="01:12:41.699" style="s2">present themselves and what we&#39;re really</p>
