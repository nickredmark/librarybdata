<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.980" style="s2">so you&#39;ll undoubtedly you&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:07.649" style="s2">that this is being taped so the tapes</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:10.260" style="s2">will show up on some relatively regular</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.649" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">schedule I wouldn&#39;t expect that</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:15.330" style="s2">precisely because I don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:16.500" style="s2">any promises about you know exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">quickly that&#39;ll be done</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.500" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">Martin Jang here is doing it on its own</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">accord so it&#39;s like you know two thumbs</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:24.539" style="s2">up for Martin as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">because he&#39;s done this for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.539" end="00:00:29.279" style="s2">my courses and it&#39;s a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">it&#39;s much appreciated so anyways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.279" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">why all of this stuff is set up so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:40.879" style="s2">think I told you pretty much about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:44.910" style="s2">the class entails on your part you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.879" end="00:00:47.340" style="s2">and if you you&#39;ve heard this lecture and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.910" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">I&#39;m sure at least a reasonable number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.340" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">you have heard me lecture before so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">sort of know what how I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">lecture and that was more or less how</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do it I&#39;m hoping that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">know we can make this class like deadly</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:03.899" style="s2">successful that&#39;s the idea and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.949" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">you&#39;ll regard it as something that no</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.899" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">depending on your participation</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">obviously you&#39;ll regard it as something</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">that&#39;s really valuable I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.430" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">the stuff I&#39;ve learned that I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">you about it has been so useful to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">that I can&#39;t buy I can&#39;t I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:21.780" style="s2">even communicate how useful it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">it&#39;s been unbelievably useful and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">know partly what I&#39;m going to explain to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">you if I can is why you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">tenets of classical morality and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:33.930" style="s2">a variety of them and one of them is for</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">example don&#39;t lie and you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.930" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">tough one because you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">you know why not really why not I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:43.950" style="s2">if you can if if you can set up a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">situation so that you benefit from from</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">an untruth what stops you from doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">you know and Dostoevsky and one of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2">most famous statements he said if</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no God everything is permitted</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">and it&#39;s a take-off on Nietzschean</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">thinking too and it&#39;s a problem that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:02.280" style="s2">thought would be the fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">of the 20th century and I think he was</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:05.450" style="s2">absolutely right and it&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:07.860" style="s2">very much worth thinking about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.450" end="00:02:09.569" style="s2">why bother with things that are moral</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.860" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">why do things right is there even such a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.569" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">thing as doing things right these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:15.900" style="s2">great questions you</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:19.530" style="s2">and hopefully I&#39;m what I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.900" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">to do with you guys is to show you what</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.530" end="00:02:23.460" style="s2">the consequence I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">those things for you know it&#39;s almost 30</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.460" end="00:02:29.340" style="s2">years I guess now and I you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:32.100" style="s2">got a ways certainly a ways that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.340" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">been satisfying to me and I want to tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.100" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">you what I&#39;ve concluded and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:39.800" style="s2">decide for yourself if you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:42.600" style="s2">useful and one thing I would really like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.800" end="00:02:45.110" style="s2">encourage you to do is like you should</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.600" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">be skeptical about what I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.110" end="00:02:49.260" style="s2">really like you should question it like</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:51.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean the kind of skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.260" end="00:02:53.580" style="s2">that&#39;s like this because like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.450" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">I&#39;m not here to prove myself to you at</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.580" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">all and you&#39;re not here to prove</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.070" style="s2">yourself to me either so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:01.590" style="s2">listen you have to attend but by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.070" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">same token I would say like I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.590" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">you things that I&#39;ve tried to hammer to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">deth I&#39;ve tried to see if they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">wrong you know because that&#39;s how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:10.710" style="s2">supposed to test ideas you throw out an</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">idea and you hammer the hell out of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.710" end="00:03:14.490" style="s2">see if you can see if it&#39;s wrong not</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">whether it&#39;s right because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.490" end="00:03:18.300" style="s2">ideological thinking and the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:21.540" style="s2">telling you are things I could not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.300" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">disprove they seem to stand up and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.540" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">tried multiple tests you know so one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:27.660" style="s2">them is sort of a Concilium stess t&#39; and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:30.270" style="s2">the concilium says a word that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.660" end="00:03:33.090" style="s2">defined by Edward or Wilson and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.270" end="00:03:34.920" style="s2">when an explanation is Concilium what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.090" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">that means is that it&#39;s coherent across</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.920" end="00:03:39.960" style="s2">multiple levels of analysis you know and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:42.770" style="s2">so I&#39;ve tried to test the ideas that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.960" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">describing to you I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.770" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">determine whether they&#39;re logically</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">coherent and appropriate at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:53.870" style="s2">general psychology and clinical</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">psychology and neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.870" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">narrative theory and religious thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">and then also to see if they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:04.710" style="s2">applicable as practical as practical</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:07.380" style="s2">realities in day-to-day life and and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.710" end="00:04:09.270" style="s2">social life and as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.380" end="00:04:11.820" style="s2">they stand up that&#39;s been my experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.270" end="00:04:13.770" style="s2">and I&#39;ve also watched people over many</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.820" end="00:04:16.260" style="s2">years now try to apply them in their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.770" end="00:04:18.209" style="s2">lives and all I&#39;ve been able to see so</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.260" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">far with my graduate students and so on</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.209" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">is that they works so you know arrayed</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">for that and so we&#39;re going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:27.200" style="s2">understand some basic issues like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:29.780" style="s2">the utility</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.200" end="00:04:31.400" style="s2">truth is and that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.780" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">question it&#39;s a it&#39;s maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.400" end="00:04:37.130" style="s2">fundamental question is truth useful and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:38.630" style="s2">if so how and why and like man we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.130" end="00:04:40.940" style="s2">going to go after that especially with</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.630" end="00:04:42.920" style="s2">regards to verbal truth because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.940" end="00:04:44.810" style="s2">something magical about words there</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.920" end="00:04:47.150" style="s2">really is something magical about them</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.810" end="00:04:48.680" style="s2">and the way you use words determines the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.150" end="00:04:50.390" style="s2">course of your life and maybe more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.680" end="00:04:53.540" style="s2">that maybe the course of everyone&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:55.250" style="s2">so I want to explain to you how that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.540" end="00:04:56.630" style="s2">be true and what it means so you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.250" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">that should be relatively entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.630" end="00:05:03.260" style="s2">and hopefully what else I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:04.820" style="s2">is I&#39;m going to throw out some key</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.260" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">propositions there&#39;s probably about</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.820" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">seven or eight of them and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.130" style="s2">hoping is that you&#39;ll be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:11.990" style="s2">those propositions as keys that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.130" end="00:05:13.190" style="s2">help you unlock things that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">otherwise be able to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.190" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">understand and I gave you some example</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">of that with this little story you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2">because that little story happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:24.230" style="s2">an extraordinarily deep little story and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:26.360" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so old that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.230" end="00:05:28.670" style="s2">story like I think that story stems from</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.360" end="00:05:30.710" style="s2">when we were still in trees really and</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.670" end="00:05:32.420" style="s2">that our when our prime enemies were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.710" end="00:05:34.150" style="s2">snakes because it does appear according</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.420" end="00:05:38.840" style="s2">to Lynn Isbell anyways who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.150" end="00:05:40.910" style="s2">anthropologist in California that our</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.840" end="00:05:42.530" style="s2">primary predators 60 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.910" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">when we were basically inhabiting trees</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">were predatory snakes and that we</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.130" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">only the oldest story we know from a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.770" end="00:05:56.150" style="s2">consciously articulated perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:06:00.920" style="s2">it might be the literal story of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.150" end="00:06:02.210" style="s2">species as a biological entity so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.920" end="00:06:03.890" style="s2">know that and I&#39;m telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.210" end="00:06:06.560" style="s2">because it gives you some idea about how</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.890" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">deep these stories can go they can go</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.560" end="00:06:11.570" style="s2">right to the brilli to the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:15.230" style="s2">things and if you know some of these key</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.570" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">propositions when you see archetypal</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:21.140" style="s2">that happens all the time like when all</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.140" end="00:06:25.250" style="s2">lady or later lately there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:27.350" style="s2">hordes of them they&#39;re tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.250" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">expensive to make a hundreds of millions</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.830" end="00:06:34.850" style="s2">themes you know I think it&#39;s of great</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.080" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">interest to know the most expensive</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">stories you know and that&#39;s also the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.140" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">technological process that in large part</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:54.020" style="s2">is driving computer innovation because</p>

<p begin="00:06:54.020" end="00:06:59.780" style="s2">things like computer chips is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:07:01.220" style="s2">you know recreating reality cgi reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.780" end="00:07:02.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s the most complicated thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.220" end="00:07:05.390" style="s2">to do it&#39;s like what the hell why are we</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.930" end="00:07:06.980" style="s2">doing that what&#39;s up with that why would</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.390" end="00:07:09.410" style="s2">you spend 300 million dollars making</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.980" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">Iron Man you know you there&#39;s a profit</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.410" end="00:07:12.260" style="s2">motive there obviously but everybody</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:13.820" style="s2">will go see it it&#39;s like what&#39;s up with</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.260" end="00:07:16.460" style="s2">you people you know you&#39;ll see some</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.820" end="00:07:18.290" style="s2">dingbat in a metal suit fly around in</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.460" end="00:07:19.670" style="s2">the air you know that&#39;s not true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.290" end="00:07:21.860" style="s2">like what are you doing at those movies</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.670" end="00:07:24.290" style="s2">you think well I&#39;m entertaining myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.860" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah yeah right except why is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.290" end="00:07:29.180" style="s2">it entertaining and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:31.310" style="s2">entertaining to all of you and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.180" end="00:07:32.480" style="s2">entertaining to everyone you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.310" end="00:07:34.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.480" end="00:07:36.440" style="s2">so partly what we&#39;re going to find out</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.040" end="00:07:38.390" style="s2">too is what it is about stories that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:40.520" style="s2">attract our interest and why it is why</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.390" end="00:07:43.310" style="s2">that is and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not merely</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:47.510" style="s2">entertainment it&#39;s like the most potent</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.310" end="00:07:49.220" style="s2">form of learning that we have so well</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.510" end="00:07:50.810" style="s2">anyway so that&#39;s the goal and during</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.220" end="00:07:53.630" style="s2">this as well you know I hope that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.810" end="00:07:55.580" style="s2">can articulate yourselves further and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.630" end="00:07:59.120" style="s2">also come to some deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.580" end="00:08:01.190" style="s2">about the absolute essential nature of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.120" end="00:08:02.990" style="s2">proper language use in in spoken</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.190" end="00:08:05.720" style="s2">language and in written language because</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.990" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">you bet you basically think and speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.720" end="00:08:09.710" style="s2">and write yourself into existence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:11.480" style="s2">one of the things that means is you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.710" end="00:08:14.480" style="s2">should be very very careful with what</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.480" end="00:08:16.790" style="s2">you say because you are literally</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.480" end="00:08:18.260" style="s2">bringing realms of reality into being</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.790" end="00:08:19.730" style="s2">through speaking and you want to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.260" end="00:08:21.770" style="s2">bloody sure that the realms of reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.730" end="00:08:23.420" style="s2">that you&#39;re participating and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.770" end="00:08:25.580" style="s2">into being are the ones that you would</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.420" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">actually like yourself and those you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.580" end="00:08:35.420" style="s2">love to inhabit so you know it&#39;s a well</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:37.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t have much more to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.420" end="00:08:42.400" style="s2">course than that so what I&#39;ll do now is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:42.400" style="s2">see if you have any questions so yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.460" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">right well yeah you know okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.100" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">question is why is the Dragon portrayed</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.930" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">as bad it&#39;s like well first of all we</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:10.470" style="s2">might notice that culture cross</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:12.510" style="s2">culturally that&#39;s not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.470" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">case right so the dragon in the West</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.510" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">tends to be something to conquer and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:21.150" style="s2">something that hoards virgins</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:22.470" style="s2">strangely enough and it&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.150" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">be conquered and the treasure to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.470" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">taken but in the East particularly among</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">the Chinese the dragon is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:30.330" style="s2">that&#39;s positive and what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:31.800" style="s2">when we&#39;ll study this when we get into</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.330" end="00:09:33.780" style="s2">the symbolism that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.800" end="00:09:35.640" style="s2">with reptiles fundamentally with</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.780" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">predatory reptiles you see that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.640" end="00:09:39.690" style="s2">dragon is actually a tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:41.880" style="s2">ambivalent representation because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.690" end="00:09:45.000" style="s2">represents it really represents the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.880" end="00:09:47.940" style="s2">unknown or even more precisely it</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.000" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">represents the element of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.940" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">that you don&#39;t even know exists you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:54.090" style="s2">because sometimes something unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:56.850" style="s2">could happen to you but you you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.090" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">understand it when it happens but</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.850" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">sometimes something unexpected happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.100" style="s2">to you and it&#39;s so unexpected that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:03.990" style="s2">can&#39;t even conceptualize it I would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.100" end="00:10:05.960" style="s2">when when the twin towers fell in New</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.990" end="00:10:08.490" style="s2">York that was an event like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.960" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">really domain of your understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.490" end="00:10:13.080" style="s2">then there&#39;s a there&#39;s an ambivalence</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">about that because you don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.080" end="00:10:19.830" style="s2">nature of the event precisely so that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:22.200" style="s2">the predatory reptile especially the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.830" end="00:10:24.210" style="s2">treasure garden predatory reptile stands</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.200" end="00:10:26.700" style="s2">for the potential that exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.210" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">unknown and that potential can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.700" end="00:10:31.290" style="s2">positive and negative right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">the source of all all new things but</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.290" end="00:10:34.710" style="s2">it&#39;s also the source of that which will</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:37.710" style="s2">destroy you and so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.710" end="00:10:41.160" style="s2">paradoxical entity now one more thing so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.710" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">so the story implies that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.160" end="00:10:45.480" style="s2">optimal size of dragon and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.790" style="s2">while your nervous systems are actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.480" end="00:10:50.130" style="s2">tuned to detect the optimal size of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.790" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">dragons we&#39;ll talk about this in great</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.130" end="00:10:53.690" style="s2">detail as we</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">through the biology of anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.690" end="00:10:56.360" style="s2">disgust as it turns out which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">something I&#39;ve learned more about</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.360" end="00:11:04.040" style="s2">recently you know how you can sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.670" end="00:11:05.630" style="s2">if you&#39;re engaged in a task let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.040" end="00:11:07.820" style="s2">cognitive task you can find it</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.630" end="00:11:09.680" style="s2">overwhelming its write something or have</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.820" end="00:11:11.000" style="s2">a very difficult time understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.680" end="00:11:13.130" style="s2">maybe you even wonder if you&#39;re up to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.000" end="00:11:14.810" style="s2">okay so you might say well your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.130" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">system is indicating to you that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.810" end="00:11:18.589" style="s2">a threat and then other times you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:20.899" style="s2">dealing say with the cognitive task</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.589" end="00:11:24.529" style="s2">that&#39;s beneath your abilities and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.899" end="00:11:26.180" style="s2">it&#39;s easy and you get bored so then</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.529" end="00:11:28.339" style="s2">you&#39;ll be dealing with a cognitive task</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.180" end="00:11:29.990" style="s2">that it&#39;s like Goldilocks and the three</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.339" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">bears right the temperature is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.990" end="00:11:34.850" style="s2">right and what happens is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">to grapple with the task and it pushes</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.850" end="00:11:38.899" style="s2">you forward in your development but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:40.940" style="s2">also really engages you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.899" end="00:11:43.250" style="s2">so you&#39;re tied right into it it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.940" end="00:11:45.589" style="s2">easy to remember and understand it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.250" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">make progress and it&#39;s difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.589" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">energy demanding but you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">captivated by the process that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">right size dragon and that&#39;s what your</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:58.610" style="s2">nervous system is telling you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:12:00.980" style="s2">saying look this this amount of novel</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.530" end="00:13:02.370" style="s2">now you know here&#39;s something to think</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.780" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">about in relationship to that I did a</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.370" end="00:13:05.820" style="s2">little TED talk on potential which if</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:07.380" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.820" end="00:13:09.900" style="s2">you might want to look look at because I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.380" end="00:13:13.590" style="s2">got it right in that talk I thought but</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.900" end="00:13:15.300" style="s2">you know you there are different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.590" end="00:13:17.730" style="s2">thinking about what the world&#39;s made out</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.300" end="00:13:20.310" style="s2">of and you know we think that it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.730" end="00:13:23.430" style="s2">out of matter that&#39;s the basic dogma say</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.310" end="00:13:25.020" style="s2">of the materialist realm and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.430" end="00:13:26.610" style="s2">look it&#39;s really useful to treat the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.020" end="00:13:28.200" style="s2">world as if it&#39;s made out of matter and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.610" end="00:13:30.510" style="s2">look at all the things that treating in</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.200" end="00:13:32.430" style="s2">that way has allowed us to do but that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.510" end="00:13:34.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the final statement</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.430" end="00:13:36.540" style="s2">about the nature of reality and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.380" end="00:13:37.980" style="s2">matter is is pretty damn strange when</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.540" end="00:13:39.390" style="s2">you get to the bottom of it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.980" end="00:13:40.620" style="s2">understand it at all and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.390" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">understand its relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.620" end="00:13:46.260" style="s2">consciousness but putting that aside we</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:48.810" style="s2">also act as if things other than matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.260" end="00:13:50.940" style="s2">are real so for example we act as if</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.810" end="00:13:53.280" style="s2">potential is real and that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.940" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">strange thing you know because potential</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.280" end="00:13:57.150" style="s2">by its very nature is not really defined</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:59.160" style="s2">because otherwise it would be potential</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.150" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">right it would be actuality but you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.160" end="00:14:02.550" style="s2">all of you understand your parents when</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:03.570" style="s2">they say well you know you should live</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.550" end="00:14:06.270" style="s2">up to your potential</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.570" end="00:14:08.040" style="s2">or there&#39;s potential there and I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.270" end="00:14:09.900" style="s2">say actually most of the time when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.040" end="00:14:12.030" style="s2">dealing with the world what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.900" end="00:14:14.250" style="s2">dealing with is not the material world</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.030" end="00:14:16.530" style="s2">per se what we&#39;re dealing with is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.250" end="00:14:19.260" style="s2">potential it&#39;s like what we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.530" end="00:14:22.230" style="s2">with what this could be and we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.260" end="00:14:24.270" style="s2">to realize the potential and so another</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.230" end="00:14:26.190" style="s2">thing that you could think about think</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.270" end="00:14:28.590" style="s2">about with regards to the symbol of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.190" end="00:14:31.260" style="s2">Dragon in particular it&#39;s the predator</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.590" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">the predatory reptile more basically is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.260" end="00:14:36.780" style="s2">that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a representation of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.450" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2">potential and so and I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.780" end="00:14:40.350" style="s2">that it takes reptilian form and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:42.090" style="s2">going to talk about this in great detail</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.350" end="00:14:44.130" style="s2">is I think that what happened as we</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.090" end="00:14:48.860" style="s2">evolved is that the systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.130" end="00:14:52.050" style="s2">originally evolved to detect predators</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.860" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">constitute underwent a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.050" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:57.100" style="s2">that transformed the world into abstract</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:59.529" style="s2">representations around us that initial</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.100" end="00:15:01.839" style="s2">predatory detection system was</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.529" end="00:15:05.230" style="s2">elaborated up into the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.839" end="00:15:07.000" style="s2">use to detect the unknown as such but</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.230" end="00:15:10.060" style="s2">you know because it&#39;s evolution the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:11.470" style="s2">fundamental elements that evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.060" end="00:15:14.019" style="s2">the course of evolution remained intact</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.470" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">we&#39;re using the same systems and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.019" end="00:15:18.519" style="s2">system has a language and so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:20.920" style="s2">language is something like well the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.519" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">unexpected event is sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.920" end="00:15:25.300" style="s2">snake in the grass which is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">reasonable you can think about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.300" end="00:15:29.470" style="s2">metaphor it&#39;s I think it&#39;s deeper than a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">metaphor but you can think about it as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.470" end="00:15:34.949" style="s2">metaphor and I would say well there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:38.019" style="s2">optimal size we have optimal sized</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.949" end="00:15:40.750" style="s2">adversaries and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.019" end="00:15:43.629" style="s2">live without an optimal sized adversary</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.750" end="00:15:45.399" style="s2">which is also an interesting it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.629" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">interesting idea because you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.399" end="00:15:49.629" style="s2">the things that people always ask this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:51.339" style="s2">is a very metaphysical discussion is you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.629" end="00:15:54.879" style="s2">know why there has to be evil and horror</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.339" end="00:15:56.430" style="s2">in the world it&#39;s like well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.879" end="00:15:58.569" style="s2">clear to me that the world could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.430" end="00:16:01.089" style="s2">constituted in the manner that its</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.569" end="00:16:04.209" style="s2">constituted in any acceptable way if</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.089" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">there were no adversaries it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.209" end="00:16:07.720" style="s2">maybe the snake in the garden is</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:09.699" style="s2">necessary you know maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.720" end="00:16:11.980" style="s2">imperfection and also that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.699" end="00:16:15.129" style="s2">adversary is necessary it&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.980" end="00:16:17.220" style="s2">that spurs on development it it what</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.129" end="00:16:20.680" style="s2">would there be without an adversary</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.220" end="00:16:22.389" style="s2">maybe nothing you know because you like</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.680" end="00:16:24.009" style="s2">to have I can give you an example it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.389" end="00:16:26.009" style="s2">funny example there&#39;s this little animal</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.009" end="00:16:28.029" style="s2">whose name I cannot remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.009" end="00:16:31.779" style="s2">unfortunately but it lives in the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.029" end="00:16:33.790" style="s2">and in its larval stage it has a brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.779" end="00:16:35.050" style="s2">swims around it&#39;s a little tiny thing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.790" end="00:16:36.490" style="s2">swims around you know like the little</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.050" end="00:16:38.589" style="s2">plankton and so on and then at some</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.490" end="00:16:40.750" style="s2">point during its development its fastens</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.589" end="00:16:41.829" style="s2">itself onto a rock and it grows into</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.750" end="00:16:44.620" style="s2">something that sort of looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.829" end="00:16:46.990" style="s2">plant you know but it&#39;s stable it never</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.620" end="00:16:51.550" style="s2">moves again so as it develops into this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.990" end="00:16:53.379" style="s2">stable rock clinging entity it basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.550" end="00:16:55.629" style="s2">digests its own brain and then it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.379" end="00:16:57.069" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need one after that and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.629" end="00:16:58.629" style="s2">reason it doesn&#39;t need one is well there</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.069" end="00:17:00.519" style="s2">isn&#39;t really anything for it to do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.629" end="00:17:03.149" style="s2">just sits there filters water it takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.519" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">like a sponge sort of it takes the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.149" end="00:17:09.189" style="s2">nutrients of the water in the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">just like it&#39;s extra energy using tissue</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.189" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">and so it doesn&#39;t need the brain anymore</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s like you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.900" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">think if you haven&#39;t got an adversary so</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:23.230" style="s2">so then you think well are there optimal</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:26.260" style="s2">sized adversaries and part of the little</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.230" end="00:17:28.120" style="s2">motif of that story is if you pay</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.260" end="00:17:29.680" style="s2">careful attention to things as they</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.120" end="00:17:32.740" style="s2">change maybe you can keep the damn</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.680" end="00:17:37.570" style="s2">adversaries optimized and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.740" end="00:17:39.850" style="s2">actually it may not be true but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.570" end="00:17:42.490" style="s2">possible that it&#39;s true and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.850" end="00:17:44.020" style="s2">something you know that&#39;s something if</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:45.580" style="s2">you really pay because the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.020" end="00:17:47.440" style="s2">might be and this is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.580" end="00:17:48.730" style="s2">thought about when I was developing all</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.440" end="00:17:50.740" style="s2">these are there&#39;s a little kind of looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.730" end="00:17:52.210" style="s2">like okay well there&#39;s obviously some</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.740" end="00:17:53.830" style="s2">things about existence that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.210" end="00:17:55.990" style="s2">exactly the way you might lay them out</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.830" end="00:17:57.400" style="s2">if you had the choice you know like the</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.950" end="00:18:10.660" style="s2">fine it&#39;s easy to judge that as</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">unacceptable and maybe even worse than</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.050" end="00:18:32.170" style="s2">maybe if you brought all of your</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:19:00.610" style="s2">is existential you have to act it out</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.460" end="00:19:03.010" style="s2">but as I mentioned earlier I see very</p>

<p begin="00:19:24.120" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">effective one of the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:32.280" style="s2">weapons you have in that engagement is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:34.020" style="s2">the capacity to pay attention and paying</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.280" end="00:19:35.820" style="s2">attention and it&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.020" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">learned over the years and that&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">we kind of conflate rational thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:47.310" style="s2">with attention and sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:49.050" style="s2">attention like the ugly stepsister of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.310" end="00:19:50.610" style="s2">rationality in some sense because we</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.630" end="00:20:25.140" style="s2">attention is much more powerful than</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.920" end="00:20:33.840" style="s2">you can pay attention to the things you</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.780" end="00:20:35.370" style="s2">don&#39;t know and you can become incredibly</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.429" end="00:22:01.530" style="s2">ancient Egyptians actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:03.929" style="s2">conceptualized attention as a god and</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.929" end="00:22:08.039" style="s2">was Horus and you all know of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.970" end="00:22:11.309" style="s2">because you&#39;ve all seen representations</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.039" end="00:22:13.230" style="s2">of course the famous Egyptian I a single</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.309" end="00:22:14.610" style="s2">eye that&#39;s a representation of Horus and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.230" end="00:22:17.010" style="s2">the Egyptians figured out like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.610" end="00:22:19.799" style="s2">Mesopotamians have before them that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.010" end="00:22:21.960" style="s2">highest human deity which is like the</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.490" end="00:22:30.750" style="s2">but but even more importantly with the</p>

<p begin="00:22:30.750" end="00:22:34.950" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of suspension of judgment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.210" end="00:22:37.620" style="s2">like you don&#39;t have to be right or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.950" end="00:22:40.260" style="s2">in the situation all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.620" end="00:22:42.750" style="s2">pay attention and listen and watch and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.260" end="00:22:47.970" style="s2">then potentially a solution will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.750" end="00:22:50.220" style="s2">out of that and look how our brain is</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.970" end="00:22:52.590" style="s2">visual cortex approximately you know so</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.220" end="00:22:54.390" style="s2">paying attention were incredible visual</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.460" end="00:23:11.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s also an empirical search in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.990" end="00:23:13.020" style="s2">some sense which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.550" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">this is part of why I got interested in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.020" end="00:23:18.540" style="s2">psychodynamic ideas it&#39;s like there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.610" style="s2">things that rule the way that you govern</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.540" end="00:23:23.100" style="s2">yourself that you have no control over</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.150" end="00:23:29.780" style="s2">in some things like well good luck</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.500" end="00:23:31.980" style="s2">trying to make yourself interested</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.780" end="00:23:34.020" style="s2">sometimes you can do it to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.980" end="00:23:35.730" style="s2">but more particularly what seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.020" end="00:23:37.770" style="s2">happen is that your interest highlights</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.730" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">things for you and then you follow that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.770" end="00:23:42.050" style="s2">around like you&#39;re following up you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:44.910" style="s2">a search beam or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.050" end="00:23:47.700" style="s2">to me that indicates the action of very</p>

<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.680" style="s2">moment and like that&#39;s a different way</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.490" end="00:26:10.770" style="s2">to live you know because you can you can</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.180" end="00:26:37.350" style="s2">sense it&#39;s like if you have faith in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.700" end="00:26:39.990" style="s2">truth what that means is that you will</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.350" end="00:26:42.030" style="s2">say the truth and that&#39;s a hard thing to</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:54.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a sophisticated it&#39;s it</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.750" end="00:27:03.750" style="s2">sophisticated it requires a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">amount of sophistication but you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.750" end="00:27:09.180" style="s2">one thing you might think about is well</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.090" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you are attempting to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.180" end="00:27:16.230" style="s2">yourself a mouthpiece of the truth you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:19.140" style="s2">have reality on your side and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.230" end="00:27:21.070" style="s2">might say well could you possibly have</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.140" end="00:27:24.400" style="s2">anything more powerful on your side</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.070" end="00:27:26.580" style="s2">reality and so it might not be a reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.400" end="00:27:28.990" style="s2">you want or the thing that you wish for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.580" end="00:27:32.140" style="s2">but you might think well you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.990" end="00:27:34.060" style="s2">if you called things as you saw them and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.140" end="00:27:35.890" style="s2">you were very careful about that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.060" end="00:27:38.650" style="s2">that would lead you through life</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.890" end="00:27:41.500" style="s2">properly it&#39;s a very different way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.650" end="00:27:43.240" style="s2">thinking and it is tied with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.500" end="00:27:45.010" style="s2">that there&#39;s something fundamental about</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.240" end="00:27:47.620" style="s2">the truth so I would say to start this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.010" end="00:27:50.020" style="s2">if you want just pay attention to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.620" end="00:27:52.210" style="s2">you say you know and would like your</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.020" end="00:27:53.710" style="s2">detached from it so don&#39;t identify too</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.210" end="00:27:55.150" style="s2">much with what you&#39;re saying because</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.710" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing that people do they</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.150" end="00:27:58.930" style="s2">identify with what they think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:02.050" style="s2">what makes you think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.930" end="00:28:04.180" style="s2">thinking like one of the things you said</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.050" end="00:28:06.100" style="s2">which I really loved that blew me just</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.180" end="00:28:09.660" style="s2">it just flattened me when I first read</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.100" end="00:28:13.540" style="s2">it he said people do not have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.660" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">ideas have people and so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.540" end="00:28:17.290" style="s2">listened ideologue stalk all the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:19.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not them talking and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.290" end="00:28:22.120" style="s2">some dead and dead spirit of the past</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.540" end="00:28:23.620" style="s2">that&#39;s you know voicing its opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.120" end="00:28:24.610" style="s2">through them and you can tell when</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.620" end="00:28:26.110" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to someone like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.610" end="00:28:28.180" style="s2">because you can predict everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.110" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">they&#39;re going to say so in what sense is</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.180" end="00:28:33.160" style="s2">that them talking it isn&#39;t them talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:35.710" style="s2">at all it&#39;s some collective it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.160" end="00:28:38.410" style="s2">collective voice that that that has</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.710" end="00:28:41.350" style="s2">appropriated them and convinced them</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.410" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually part of them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.350" end="00:28:45.060" style="s2">like no that&#39;s a devil that&#39;s what that</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.060" end="00:28:50.860" style="s2">so so just watch you can try this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.520" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">experiment all on your own try it for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.860" end="00:28:55.720" style="s2">month detach yourself from what you say</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:28:57.160" style="s2">and think and notice when you say</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.720" end="00:28:59.890" style="s2">something if it makes you feel more</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.160" end="00:29:03.100" style="s2">grounded and powerful or weaker and stop</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.590" end="00:29:14.980" style="s2">must be just about 4 X 4 o 3 so then</p>
