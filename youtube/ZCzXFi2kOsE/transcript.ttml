<p begin="00:02:01.780" end="00:02:06.670" style="s2">way I think we need to focus a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:08.679" style="s2">on the traditional system or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.670" end="00:02:11.020" style="s2">judiciary alongside the executive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.679" end="00:02:12.730" style="s2">the legislative and this is also calling</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.130" end="00:02:22.360" style="s2">of the majority and in an</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.360" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">take much marginal imagination who is</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:31.300" style="s2">future and I think is important that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.319" end="00:02:34.120" style="s2">courts become part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.300" end="00:02:36.459" style="s2">protecting the rights of those who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.120" end="00:02:37.739" style="s2">not in bonilla and this is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.459" end="00:02:41.860" style="s2">true when it comes to sustainability</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:32.940" style="s2">maybe Asia or Europe or the United</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.980" end="00:03:35.520" style="s2">States or even Africa I think secondly</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.940" end="00:03:38.940" style="s2">they also have a moment where the global</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.480" end="00:03:58.170" style="s2">search that in our diverse world but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">think we see a lot of critique here but</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.170" end="00:04:04.350" style="s2">I think soul Society also has ability to</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.350" end="00:04:11.280" style="s2">not a lack of capacity to stab the lack</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:14.610" style="s2">of a coherent conversation if you want</p>
