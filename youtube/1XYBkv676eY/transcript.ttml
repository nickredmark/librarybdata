<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:06.270" style="s2">work at cognitive policy works his last</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.650" end="00:00:08.309" style="s2">few years because your supporters of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.270" end="00:00:10.530" style="s2">George Lake off and you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.309" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">seeing framing put into use in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.530" end="00:00:15.120" style="s2">political world so I thought today that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.630" end="00:00:17.609" style="s2">I would create this video to explain to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.120" end="00:00:19.890" style="s2">you a little bit about how the work in</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.609" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">framing has been developing and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">beginning to be implemented in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">political world through the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve had in the last few years doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">this kind of work so for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">who aren&#39;t familiar with framing I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">recommend that you read don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">an elephant or thinking points by George</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:40.500" style="s2">Lake off to start to get a flavor of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">what it is but basically I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.500" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">assume for the sake of brevity today</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">that you already understand what framing</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">is so basically in the last few years I</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:53.070" style="s2">have been working with a number of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">different organizations to implement</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.070" end="00:00:59.449" style="s2">framing strategies in communications in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">campaigns in organizational development</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.449" end="00:01:05.760" style="s2">contexts and one of the challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">has made this slower than than you might</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.760" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">have thought initially is that framing</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:15.170" style="s2">is about changing the conceptual models</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">that people have for understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.170" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">the way that people think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">different issues as well as how</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">organizations approach those issues and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">that means since it&#39;s about conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">models it&#39;s about the ways that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:30.689" style="s2">understand things and that goes much</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">deeper than language it goes deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">the word choices that are used in say a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:38.299" style="s2">press release or a political ad and get</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">all the way down to the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.299" end="00:01:44.220" style="s2">relationships between different people</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">and ideas within organizations as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.220" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">as with the general public so over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:52.310" style="s2">last several years there has been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:54.420" style="s2">growing interest in the work of Lake off</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.310" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">you know george leigh coughs work on</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.420" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">political framing and there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">growing recognition among executive</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">level managers that is the people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">direct campaigns and her direct</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">communications they direct field</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:12.760" style="s2">operations within unions for example to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:14.950" style="s2">implement framing strategies in there</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.760" end="00:02:18.579" style="s2">and one of the big challenges has been</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.950" end="00:02:20.709" style="s2">that in order to do framing work or to</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.579" end="00:02:22.269" style="s2">communicate deeply at a level of values</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.709" end="00:02:24.549" style="s2">in a way that resonates with people</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.269" end="00:02:27.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a need to restructure the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.549" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">that organizations work and you know for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.640" end="00:02:35.019" style="s2">example in order to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:37.930" style="s2">public in a different way the field</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.019" end="00:02:39.909" style="s2">operations staff at a union which is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">people that go out and organize people</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.909" end="00:02:43.780" style="s2">on the ground has to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">differently with the communications</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.780" end="00:02:47.890" style="s2">department of the same Union and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:51.099" style="s2">possibly with communications departments</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.890" end="00:02:52.629" style="s2">and unions of other compartment and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:56.470" style="s2">field operations of other organizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.629" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">other unions other nonprofits other</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.470" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">political action committees and other</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">such groups so the collaboration element</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:05.829" style="s2">has always been a challenge and getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:08.079" style="s2">framing implemented well last week I</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.829" end="00:03:10.359" style="s2">participated in something that I found</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.079" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">really exciting I was invited to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.359" end="00:03:15.370" style="s2">United Kingdom into London to work with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:18.069" style="s2">a group of development ordered</p>

<p begin="00:03:18.069" end="00:03:23.019" style="s2">global poverty that have been grappling</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.379" end="00:03:25.209" style="s2">with lay coughs work on framing for</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.019" end="00:03:27.790" style="s2">about three years now in a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.209" end="00:03:31.000" style="s2">serious focused way with the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2">creating a coalition that brings all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:38.980" style="s2">those organizations together to address</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.750" end="00:03:41.069" style="s2">the deep cultural obstacles to to having</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.980" end="00:03:43.209" style="s2">the populace in the United Kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.069" end="00:03:45.639" style="s2">collaborating to try to solve global</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.209" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">poverty and one of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.639" end="00:03:54.639" style="s2">obstacles is the suite of of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">pro-consumer values that align with</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.639" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">self-interest and individualism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:02.290" style="s2">selfish or materialistic drives and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.500" end="00:04:05.079" style="s2">those get in the way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.290" end="00:04:08.199" style="s2">promote more community-oriented socially</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.079" end="00:04:11.470" style="s2">responsible values that are aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.199" end="00:04:14.290" style="s2">the changes in global finance and with</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.470" end="00:04:17.349" style="s2">market economies that perpetuate poverty</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.290" end="00:04:19.959" style="s2">around the world so as we were coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.349" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">together to talk about the attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.959" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2">bring framing into their work they</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:27.430" style="s2">brought out a number of issues</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">institutional settings that make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.430" end="00:04:32.169" style="s2">difficult for them to adopt framing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:34.510" style="s2">that not that it stops them from doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.169" end="00:04:37.150" style="s2">it but only that it goes more slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.510" end="00:04:40.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s more challenging than then it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.150" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">might at first seem and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.630" end="00:04:46.479" style="s2">exciting for me to see that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:48.340" style="s2">directors of campaign departments and of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:50.470" style="s2">communications departments and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.340" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">fundraising departments within these</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.470" end="00:04:55.570" style="s2">different development organizations are</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:57.729" style="s2">coming together and having strategic</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.570" end="00:05:00.700" style="s2">conversations about creating a joint</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.729" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">campaign to address mass consumerism in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.700" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">the public at large so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:07.479" style="s2">example of a group that is taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:09.610" style="s2">framing very seriously and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.479" end="00:05:11.710" style="s2">the deep structural challenges within</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.710" end="00:05:17.860" style="s2">own sector to try to address the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.450" end="00:05:19.419" style="s2">inherent contradictions that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.860" end="00:05:22.150" style="s2">found in the frames that they used in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.419" end="00:05:24.580" style="s2">the past and the frames that they will</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.150" end="00:05:27.729" style="s2">need to move them closer to achieving</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.580" end="00:05:32.200" style="s2">their mission which is to end poverty in</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.729" end="00:05:34.510" style="s2">the world so you know this is a where on</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.200" end="00:05:37.270" style="s2">the discussion is about much more than</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.510" end="00:05:39.850" style="s2">language and it&#39;s getting deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.270" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">the experiences that people have within</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.850" end="00:05:46.440" style="s2">the public at large around issues of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:49.990" style="s2">inequality and injustice issues around</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.440" end="00:05:51.940" style="s2">economic fairness feelings people have</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">governance and feelings about democracy</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.139" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">entrepreneurship and empowerment so</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:02.229" style="s2">quite a gambit of deep issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:05.740" style="s2">all part of the effort to address global</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.229" end="00:06:07.389" style="s2">poverty and you know my role of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.740" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">was to bring an understanding of</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.100" end="00:08:53.199" style="s2">as we really try to figure out how to</p>
