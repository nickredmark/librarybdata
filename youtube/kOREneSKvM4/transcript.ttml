<p begin="00:01:18.350" end="00:01:26.930" style="s2">well so be fun I think the last one we</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.040" end="00:01:33.620" style="s2">had here there&#39;s just like this subtle</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.930" end="00:01:35.960" style="s2">background of putting a call for some</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.620" end="00:01:39.020" style="s2">more conflict because because our last</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.960" end="00:01:40.310" style="s2">hour less a mediation it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.020" end="00:01:42.710" style="s2">that was something people wanted to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.310" end="00:01:44.810" style="s2">a little bit more friction or so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.710" end="00:01:48.080" style="s2">kind of put ourselves at risk in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.810" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">ways so I can feel that kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.080" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">background as well which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">exciting and and yeah I&#39;m feeling like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:02:00.440" style="s2">want to play in that playground so cool</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.049" end="00:02:11.090" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge of this moment and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.509" end="00:02:14.060" style="s2">is I think our fourth mediation campfire</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.090" end="00:02:15.950" style="s2">and Jason Jay and myself were talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.060" end="00:02:17.269" style="s2">yesterday and it was like oh my gosh is</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.459" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">thoughts on mimetic mediation and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.279" end="00:02:31.820" style="s2">we see of this campfire</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:32.990" style="s2">the whole project in general and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.820" end="00:02:35.420" style="s2">might go around to follow up thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.990" end="00:02:37.630" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll throw it to the group for</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.420" end="00:02:43.640" style="s2">a group discussion like the other times</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.630" end="00:02:46.070" style="s2">I think that&#39;s everything so if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.640" end="00:02:49.700" style="s2">are okay I can I can open with my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.070" end="00:02:53.330" style="s2">thoughts cool no I took notes to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.700" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">I wanted to be serious about this so one</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.330" end="00:03:00.170" style="s2">thing that came up yesterday we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:03:01.820" style="s2">talking is my memory of an actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.170" end="00:03:05.630" style="s2">mediator so I used to work at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.820" end="00:03:09.830" style="s2">University of Toronto and so and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.630" end="00:03:11.780" style="s2">was like 21 different unions and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.830" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">union&#39;s you know they I had like</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.780" end="00:03:15.680" style="s2">negotiations and collective agreements</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:17.810" style="s2">with the University so they brought in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:19.580" style="s2">mediated from the Ontario government and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.810" end="00:03:21.860" style="s2">this guy he was like slick he was like</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.580" end="00:03:23.960" style="s2">hyper charming there&#39;s like sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.860" end="00:03:27.170" style="s2">an amoral quality to him as well he just</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.960" end="00:03:29.600" style="s2">wanted to sort of get a deal done he</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.170" end="00:03:32.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t really have a side or a bias it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.600" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">seemed like and I felt into that and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.750" end="00:03:35.959" style="s2">kind of felt into this mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:38.150" style="s2">project and sort of like teased out</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.959" end="00:03:40.310" style="s2">potential skills to stack or this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.150" end="00:03:42.020" style="s2">sort of my provisional skill stack or</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.310" end="00:03:43.489" style="s2">talent stack of a mimetic mediator or</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.020" end="00:03:47.180" style="s2">maybe mindset might be a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.489" end="00:03:48.320" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re looking at it there has</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.180" end="00:03:49.940" style="s2">to be sort of like a trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.320" end="00:03:52.520" style="s2">I felt sense of trust that kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.940" end="00:03:55.540" style="s2">parties are involved they trust the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.520" end="00:03:58.370" style="s2">mediator to some to some capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.540" end="00:03:59.870" style="s2">maybe like a minimal viable status you</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.370" end="00:04:02.180" style="s2">know that some kind of like saying that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.870" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">you know you want to reach out to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.180" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">mimetic mediator and when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.530" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">process of mediation I I think there has</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:14.420" style="s2">to be this sense that you genuinely have</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">to be in a liminal state of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.420" end="00:04:19.970" style="s2">unknowingness of not knowing who&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.320" end="00:04:21.739" style="s2">and we were talking like there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:25.340" style="s2">kind of thing about both sides ISM or</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.739" end="00:04:29.570" style="s2">all sides of zone like I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.340" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a medium of like of like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.570" end="00:04:33.020" style="s2">say for example we have a friend Jessica</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">Burton she&#39;s a she&#39;s a feminist really</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.020" end="00:04:36.290" style="s2">considered feminist she had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:37.700" style="s2">conversation with some in so I was like</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.290" end="00:04:39.140" style="s2">a woman hater or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.700" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not like okay somewhere in between</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.140" end="00:04:42.740" style="s2">their ideologies that&#39;s where we want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:43.439" style="s2">be like no like that&#39;s not where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.740" end="00:04:45.749" style="s2">saying like</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.439" end="00:04:48.360" style="s2">would obviously side with propositional</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.749" end="00:04:50.339" style="s2">with Jessica but I think if some</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.360" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">arrangement like that happened I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.339" end="00:04:54.149" style="s2">the goal or this is mikage of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:57.029" style="s2">thinking the goal of a mediator is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.149" end="00:04:58.619" style="s2">find right relationship between that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.029" end="00:05:00.330" style="s2">mimetic tribe or those two people or</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.619" end="00:05:01.559" style="s2">whatever and that right relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.330" end="00:05:04.559" style="s2">gonna be a different combination each</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.559" end="00:05:06.409" style="s2">time and in order to encourage or</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.559" end="00:05:08.429" style="s2">engender that right relationship it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.409" end="00:05:09.569" style="s2">you got to find you have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.429" end="00:05:13.050" style="s2">capacity to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.569" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">with those individuals those mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.050" end="00:05:16.229" style="s2">tribes and all the different sub</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:18.539" style="s2">personalities within yourself that get</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.229" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2">triggered when you experience radically</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" end="00:05:24.569" style="s2">different perspectives and points of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:26.699" style="s2">views and then so the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.569" end="00:05:28.679" style="s2">would I would say is that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.699" end="00:05:31.019" style="s2">like a bait and switch in a way like</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.679" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">this and Jared was I think some good</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.019" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">pushback on the actual term mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:37.979" style="s2">mediation was like is it really mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:39.629" style="s2">mediation we&#39;re doing and I think in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.979" end="00:05:42.119" style="s2">order to be a good mimetic mediator or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.629" end="00:05:43.829" style="s2">have a sense of the culture war you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.119" end="00:05:45.629" style="s2">to be able to dip away from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.829" end="00:05:47.699" style="s2">proposition away from the memes and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.629" end="00:05:49.529" style="s2">into the felt sense the actual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.699" end="00:05:51.149" style="s2">like speak yeah capacity to speak from</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.529" end="00:05:52.319" style="s2">your heart and actually feel what other</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.149" end="00:05:55.319" style="s2">people feel when they think what they</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.319" end="00:05:57.119" style="s2">think and if you can speak the language</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.319" end="00:05:59.479" style="s2">of the felt sense and I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.119" end="00:06:01.649" style="s2">you can speak to people directly and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.479" end="00:06:02.849" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a being switch you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.649" end="00:06:04.829" style="s2">using when you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.849" end="00:06:06.059" style="s2">using the mimetic and the narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.829" end="00:06:09.209" style="s2">all that type of stuff but you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.059" end="00:06:10.769" style="s2">speaking to them heart to heart so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.209" end="00:06:11.999" style="s2">that&#39;s the edge of my thinking and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.769" end="00:06:14.369" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.999" end="00:06:17.509" style="s2">whoever if Jason Jared want to go next</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.369" end="00:06:17.509" style="s2">feel free to jump in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.860" end="00:06:24.239" style="s2">you just won one points that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.679" end="00:06:27.509" style="s2">slightly different this on the you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.239" end="00:06:29.099" style="s2">Peter about kind of you know not going</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.509" end="00:06:30.629" style="s2">as a if you&#39;re kind of playing this role</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.099" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">of a mediator whether more formal or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.629" end="00:06:35.279" style="s2">more informal not having not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:37.559" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna go I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.279" end="00:06:40.379" style="s2">important to for everybody to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.559" end="00:06:42.089" style="s2">acknowledge their biases upfront to like</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.379" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">wear them on your sleeve because I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.089" end="00:06:47.999" style="s2">I don&#39;t think anybody is without bias</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">and if you&#39;re a mediator and you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.999" end="00:06:53.039" style="s2">of this kind of trusted third party this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:55.110" style="s2">neutral third party I think having you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.039" end="00:06:57.009" style="s2">know your bias out there like okay this</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.110" end="00:06:58.930" style="s2">is you know I can express my</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.009" end="00:07:01.449" style="s2">one of you you say hey look this is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.930" end="00:07:05.050" style="s2">is what it is and I&#39;m not gonna you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.449" end="00:07:06.759" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try my best not to use that to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.050" end="00:07:08.110" style="s2">kind of tip the scales one more the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.759" end="00:07:10.899" style="s2">other but this is what it is and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.110" end="00:07:12.509" style="s2">everybody else can see that as you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.899" end="00:07:16.869" style="s2">when I&#39;m doing my work as a mediator</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.509" end="00:07:18.369" style="s2">like they&#39;ll you know they&#39;ll be in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.869" end="00:07:20.740" style="s2">better position to notice when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.369" end="00:07:24.219" style="s2">tipping the scales I guess right because</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.740" end="00:07:27.369" style="s2">I&#39;m not sneak you know it in a sneaky</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.219" end="00:07:30.879" style="s2">way kind of like injecting my bias into</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.369" end="00:07:33.370" style="s2">like how you know I might I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.879" end="00:07:36.189" style="s2">ask a follow-up question from from you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.370" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">know one person to the other and and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.189" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">know I mean it can be it can all get</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.740" end="00:07:44.649" style="s2">very from my point of view can it can</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:48.999" style="s2">get all get very I don&#39;t know cringy</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.649" end="00:07:51.610" style="s2">real quick or it can get very can pull</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.999" end="00:07:53.709" style="s2">apart real quick if that&#39;s just not not</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.610" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">out there</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.709" end="00:07:57.419" style="s2">maybe maybe I&#39;ll give you a chance here</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:10.740" style="s2">yeah so I guess kind of kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.990" end="00:08:16.089" style="s2">abstractly the way I kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.740" end="00:08:18.189" style="s2">mediation is or mediation whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.089" end="00:08:21.149" style="s2">calling this it&#39;s really like simply</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.189" end="00:08:24.009" style="s2">being able to see other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.149" end="00:08:26.229" style="s2">perspective not fully because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.009" end="00:08:29.319" style="s2">always because we have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.229" end="00:08:32.229" style="s2">difference reference point but to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.319" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">that we have to kind of remove or we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.229" end="00:08:35.050" style="s2">have to kind of see it from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:37.510" style="s2">own perspective from the outside in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.050" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">attempted to see their own perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.510" end="00:08:41.019" style="s2">from outside in and so really like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:43.449" style="s2">think the mediation is is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.019" end="00:08:45.760" style="s2">happening when the space in between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.449" end="00:08:48.370" style="s2">ideas or the perspectives it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.760" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">illuminated right like it&#39;s made yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.370" end="00:08:52.329" style="s2">this becomes a connective tissue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">like the space in between is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.329" end="00:08:58.060" style="s2">alive where everybody&#39;s looking there to</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.980" style="s2">try and orient and understand each of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.060" end="00:09:06.149" style="s2">our each of the perspectives included</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.980" end="00:09:06.149" style="s2">and to kind of pull in this like</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:12.759" style="s2">we&#39;re framing our own cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.410" end="00:09:14.740" style="s2">and and agendas and ideologies I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.759" end="00:09:16.569" style="s2">that the best kind of framing there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.740" end="00:09:18.610" style="s2">just to see simply that like when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.569" end="00:09:20.589" style="s2">mediating if we&#39;re the person in between</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.610" end="00:09:22.870" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to illuminate that space</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.589" end="00:09:27.189" style="s2">but we should still see our own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.870" end="00:09:30.509" style="s2">emotional attachment to beliefs that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.189" end="00:09:32.769" style="s2">arising as just another interlocutor</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.509" end="00:09:35.920" style="s2">right so besides not removing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.769" end="00:09:39.459" style="s2">just from the two that are or it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.920" end="00:09:42.279" style="s2">group but we include ourselves our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.459" end="00:09:43.750" style="s2">ideas and biases in that in that thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.279" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">and so to Jason&#39;s point that means kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.750" end="00:09:48.009" style="s2">of airing it you know like maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:49.449" style="s2">know as I think it would be a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.009" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">tool for the mediator to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.449" end="00:09:53.949" style="s2">like hey I&#39;m trying to be impartial here</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:56.139" style="s2">but I also you know have a background of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.949" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">my dad a lot of family here so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.139" end="00:09:58.569" style="s2">hard for me to completely go there or</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:10:01.329" style="s2">something like that or I&#39;m feeling some</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.569" end="00:10:02.649" style="s2">sort of emotional resonance but this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.329" end="00:10:05.110" style="s2">also does point to a Jason&#39;s talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.649" end="00:10:07.240" style="s2">about is like this is you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.110" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">types of mediation is happening we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.240" end="00:10:12.970" style="s2">the same process can happen when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:14.920" style="s2">interact with anybody and and the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.970" end="00:10:17.470" style="s2">we practice it kind of being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.920" end="00:10:20.769" style="s2">our own perspective from a distance the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.470" end="00:10:23.769" style="s2">more we&#39;re prepared to be able to help</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.769" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">in a group and and this does kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.769" end="00:10:27.569" style="s2">point to some of the more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:30.279" style="s2">elements of this too which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.569" end="00:10:32.470" style="s2">finding the interworkings of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.279" end="00:10:34.810" style="s2">attachment to the ideas that arise and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.470" end="00:10:37.329" style="s2">the more that the looser we are attached</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.810" end="00:10:39.939" style="s2">to those ideas the easier it is for them</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.329" end="00:10:45.009" style="s2">to only offer themselves when the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.939" end="00:10:46.540" style="s2">context is right yeah that&#39;s just a what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.009" end="00:10:49.240" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is this is how I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.540" end="00:10:51.610" style="s2">seeing it from my perspective and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.240" end="00:10:53.439" style="s2">think what we were saying yesterday it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:10:55.630" style="s2">like having that tension always</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.439" end="00:10:57.759" style="s2">available where you acknowledge your</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.630" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">bias like what&#39;s your actual position or</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.759" end="00:11:00.790" style="s2">you think your positions are with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.380" end="00:11:02.620" style="s2">willingness to sacrifice time at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.790" end="00:11:04.689" style="s2">moment&#39;s notice and if you can hold that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.620" end="00:11:07.089" style="s2">tension and other people to see it then</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.689" end="00:11:08.980" style="s2">I think trust the felt sense of trust</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.089" end="00:11:12.069" style="s2">will emerge from a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.980" end="00:11:13.449" style="s2">different ideologies because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.069" end="00:11:15.579" style="s2">like a flirtatious element there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.449" end="00:11:16.899" style="s2">up for grabs all right it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.579" end="00:11:18.339" style="s2">almost like you get that nice edge of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.899" end="00:11:19.300" style="s2">being up for grabs for therefore their</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.339" end="00:11:19.810" style="s2">ideology</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.300" end="00:11:22.150" style="s2">I think you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.810" end="00:11:26.920" style="s2">have to be at that place in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.150" end="00:11:30.940" style="s2">into real dialogue with them and so like</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.920" end="00:11:33.190" style="s2">practically speaking but we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.940" end="00:11:34.690" style="s2">there was like so much and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.190" end="00:11:36.460" style="s2">we&#39;ve said like we should calm down just</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.690" end="00:11:37.930" style="s2">take it one one one session at a time</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.460" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much potential with</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.930" end="00:11:40.510" style="s2">this project and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:42.010" style="s2">different kind of like sessions that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.510" end="00:11:44.020" style="s2">could emerge from it or how much we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.010" end="00:11:46.029" style="s2">could do with these sessions and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.020" end="00:11:47.770" style="s2">previously you know Jordan Hall emailed</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.029" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">me with an idea about how they could</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.770" end="00:11:51.400" style="s2">have like a news channel like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:53.260" style="s2">medic mimetic tribe news channel we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.400" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">like someone talks about you know social</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.260" end="00:11:57.070" style="s2">justice activism I got like a situation</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">that happens in the world that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.070" end="00:12:01.810" style="s2">affects people about Trump or covet or</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.890" end="00:12:03.640" style="s2">whatever get the social justice take you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.810" end="00:12:06.220" style="s2">got the queuing on take you get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.640" end="00:12:08.860" style="s2">like men&#39;s rights activist take you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.220" end="00:12:10.060" style="s2">you get the dirt bag left whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.860" end="00:12:11.320" style="s2">so we have like a news channel everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.060" end="00:12:13.420" style="s2">can kind of share their opinion I</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.320" end="00:12:16.660" style="s2">thought that was pretty cool and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.420" end="00:12:21.029" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s doable another thing we</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.660" end="00:12:24.130" style="s2">mentioned so how I see the stoah space</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.029" end="00:12:25.780" style="s2">emerging or evolving naturally is like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.130" end="00:12:27.790" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s a wisdom gym a</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.780" end="00:12:29.650" style="s2">section where people get to kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.790" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">practice their wisdom which is really</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.650" end="00:12:32.860" style="s2">created by the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:34.270" style="s2">at this point there&#39;s like cyclic</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.860" end="00:12:35.710" style="s2">technology incubators where people can</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.270" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">just test things things up and if</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.710" end="00:12:38.910" style="s2">it works they could pour it into their</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:41.470" style="s2">own the wisdom gym and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.910" end="00:12:43.990" style="s2">sort of like sense making sessions where</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.470" end="00:12:45.820" style="s2">people come in these intellectuals who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.990" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">respected intellectuals come in and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.820" end="00:12:50.740" style="s2">they share their thoughts and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">Q&amp;A and we&#39;ve had many of those and some</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.740" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">of these are interesting because so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">had Alexander bard come in for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:58.210" style="s2">and we had Dave Snowden and those two</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.010" style="s2">they were on this listserv called</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.210" end="00:13:01.060" style="s2">intellectual deep web they had like was</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.010" end="00:13:03.580" style="s2">like cat and dogs they had a big fight</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.060" end="00:13:05.230" style="s2">and then Dave Stoney just left that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.580" end="00:13:06.790" style="s2">thing but now they&#39;re both getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.230" end="00:13:08.709" style="s2">warmed by the campfire this though a</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.790" end="00:13:11.110" style="s2">campfire they&#39;re trusting it and if they</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.709" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">become somewhat regulars maybe they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.110" end="00:13:16.029" style="s2">have a conversation again in a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:17.589" style="s2">faith way so next week Michael Brooks</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.029" end="00:13:20.529" style="s2">from the Michael Brooks show he&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.589" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">into stoah and Peter Burke OC and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.529" end="00:13:24.310" style="s2">Peter just randomly texted me sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:26.920" style="s2">he wants to talk and so I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.310" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">you know synchronicity and I know they</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.920" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">don&#39;t like each other pas positionally</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.680" style="s2">they could be warmed by the digital</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:34.630" style="s2">campfire maybe we can connect them</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.680" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">so I kind of like the idea like these</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.630" end="00:13:37.660" style="s2">people come in the campfire they feel</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.070" style="s2">safe they feel warm they feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.660" end="00:13:41.019" style="s2">know it was the trusted space they leave</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.070" end="00:13:42.190" style="s2">then as meteors come in and say okay how</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.019" end="00:13:43.750" style="s2">can we get these guys to talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.190" end="00:13:45.940" style="s2">other maybe it&#39;s an anti debate maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.750" end="00:13:47.769" style="s2">it&#39;s an empathy circle what is the sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.940" end="00:13:49.630" style="s2">of the angle or frame that would attract</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.769" end="00:13:54.519" style="s2">them to discuss each other with each</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.630" end="00:13:56.279" style="s2">other and then yeah yeah early over the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.519" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">last thing another one is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.279" end="00:13:59.649" style="s2">Jared mentioned this is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:02.110" style="s2">there could be also sessions where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.649" end="00:14:03.910" style="s2">just like method act a certain mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.110" end="00:14:06.579" style="s2">tribe or a certain ideology feel what</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.910" end="00:14:08.019" style="s2">they feel get really intimate with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.579" end="00:14:09.670" style="s2">propositions that they use so you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.019" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">pass their ideological Turing test just</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.670" end="00:14:14.260" style="s2"> have at it and see what emerges</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">and if you can kind of like really feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.260" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">what they feel and an advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:26.950" style="s2">strongly then maybe you can talk to them</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:29.589" style="s2">better yeah I have a number of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.950" end="00:14:32.940" style="s2">and see if I can have them together so</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.589" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">so one going off of what you said Peter</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.940" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">with you know the mimetic mediators</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:41.019" style="s2">being kind of the connective tissue you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:43.540" style="s2">know across these different</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.019" end="00:14:44.949" style="s2">personalities you know somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.540" end="00:14:47.529" style="s2">well-known personalities that are that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.949" end="00:14:50.290" style="s2">are coming into the stoah you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.529" end="00:14:53.170" style="s2">getting comfortable with the platform</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.290" end="00:14:55.540" style="s2">and trusting in the platform and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.170" end="00:14:57.459" style="s2">you know us recognizing that hey like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.540" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">there needs to be some you know dialog</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.459" end="00:15:01.990" style="s2">between these people as well not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">having their own sessions and so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.990" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">know one use of these sessions is kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:08.860" style="s2">of game planning you know how can we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:10.690" style="s2">that but another one and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.860" end="00:15:14.470" style="s2">this would be right away but actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.690" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">bringing say Michael Brooks and Bogosian</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.470" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">that would be interesting bringing them</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:21.940" style="s2">in here with a bunch of us people you</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">know aspiring mediators of impact saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.940" end="00:15:25.810" style="s2">and and helping to facilitate a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">conversation and kind of providing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.810" end="00:15:30.790" style="s2">guardrails if if one of us if it starts</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">getting heated but one of us realizes</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.790" end="00:15:33.370" style="s2">hey will you actually might have</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:34.660" style="s2">misunderstood where you&#39;ve met there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.370" end="00:15:36.940" style="s2">could you see it from this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.660" end="00:15:39.699" style="s2">so just kind of like smoothing it out a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.940" end="00:15:44.830" style="s2">little bit that that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.699" end="00:15:46.390" style="s2">possibility somewhat related I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.830" end="00:15:48.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing with these dual</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.390" end="00:15:50.590" style="s2">notions of you know a lot of people when</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.580" end="00:15:53.260" style="s2">talking about liminal space very liminal</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.590" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">time and we want to kind of encourage</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.260" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">this liminal space so we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:59.050" style="s2">have an agenda for where conversations</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.950" end="00:16:01.720" style="s2">are gonna go by the same time this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.050" end="00:16:03.670" style="s2">kind of counter concept to me is this</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.720" end="00:16:05.680" style="s2">notion of generative tension we&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.670" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">of the liminal space you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.680" end="00:16:09.400" style="s2">this kind of tension that arises and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:12.370" style="s2">hopefully it generates something you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.400" end="00:16:14.380" style="s2">know positive right so it&#39;s thinking you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.370" end="00:16:17.080" style="s2">know seeing as a mediator seeing tension</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.380" end="00:16:20.830" style="s2">not as a problem but as an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.080" end="00:16:24.910" style="s2">for something to grow could I just</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.830" end="00:16:29.200" style="s2">quickly ask a little bit on what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.910" end="00:16:31.870" style="s2">mental space means to you what it means</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.200" end="00:16:35.020" style="s2">to me is kind of a it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.870" end="00:16:38.410" style="s2">transition period you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.020" end="00:16:40.540" style="s2">period where so a lot of people describe</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.410" end="00:16:44.230" style="s2">kovin this close situations a liminal</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.540" end="00:16:47.380" style="s2">time because before that you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.230" end="00:16:49.960" style="s2">of people kind of had you know an idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.380" end="00:16:51.070" style="s2">about what was gonna happen and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.960" end="00:16:53.260" style="s2">they were planning for what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.070" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">preparing for and a liminal space kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.260" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">of when all of these kind of reference</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">points of you know how the world works</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:00.520" style="s2">and where society is going or where our</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.230" end="00:17:02.020" style="s2">lives are going kind of get thrown out</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.520" end="00:17:04.770" style="s2">the window and it&#39;s just kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.020" end="00:17:08.280" style="s2">kind of radical uncertainty or unknowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.770" end="00:17:10.180" style="s2">that&#39;s my that&#39;s my take I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.280" end="00:17:15.750" style="s2">anybody else that has different take on</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.180" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">that but I mean so in relation to like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.750" end="00:17:21.430" style="s2">cultivating an intentional liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:24.459" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s more like okay we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.430" end="00:17:26.830" style="s2">conversation and we have some ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.459" end="00:17:29.590" style="s2">frame it to get it started but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.830" end="00:17:31.900" style="s2">actually we&#39;re kind of operating in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.590" end="00:17:34.450" style="s2">emotive uncertainty and so for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.900" end="00:17:36.070" style="s2">like Jared I on our podcast we often</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.450" end="00:17:38.950" style="s2">don&#39;t really plan our conversations like</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.070" end="00:17:40.150" style="s2">we like it to just see what emerges you</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.950" end="00:17:42.520" style="s2">know and it&#39;s and that&#39;s kind of scary</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.150" end="00:17:44.290" style="s2">because like what if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.520" end="00:17:46.180" style="s2">something to talk about what if you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.290" end="00:17:48.250" style="s2">I get nervous and I shut down or</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.180" end="00:17:50.050" style="s2">something but you know but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.250" end="00:17:52.540" style="s2">exciting because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.050" end="00:17:55.300" style="s2">gonna happen right and so something can</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.540" end="00:17:56.770" style="s2">just come out that something really</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.300" end="00:17:58.510" style="s2">delicious and interesting that all of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.770" end="00:18:00.970" style="s2">sudden you know we can go</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.510" end="00:18:02.710" style="s2">but it takes the ability to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:05.070" style="s2">trust being in this liminal space in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.710" end="00:18:07.299" style="s2">this space of uncertainty of not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.070" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s how I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.299" end="00:18:09.990" style="s2">about it at least</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.430" end="00:18:21.590" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that was helpful or not</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.060" end="00:18:28.520" style="s2">er I getting a feeling for it thank you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.590" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">good let&#39;s see there anything else</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.520" end="00:18:33.860" style="s2">generative tension and oh yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:35.300" style="s2">there&#39;s that so you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.860" end="00:18:37.670" style="s2">something I these two concepts I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.300" end="00:18:40.040" style="s2">playing in my mind of like liminal space</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.670" end="00:18:41.630" style="s2">and generative tension and and and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.040" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">seem to be kind of this yin-yang</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.630" end="00:18:47.210" style="s2">situation for me it seems like I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:48.950" style="s2">about like what is well you know I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.210" end="00:18:51.560" style="s2">to have the opposite of liminal space is</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.950" end="00:18:53.450" style="s2">this kind of sense of certainty but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.560" end="00:18:54.920" style="s2">another but it seems like you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.450" end="00:18:56.660" style="s2">about in terms of what can arise out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.920" end="00:18:59.330" style="s2">them in space well all of a sudden these</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.660" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">polarities arise of like you know and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.330" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">perhaps different competing worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.690" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">right and so there&#39;s like this tension</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:09.230" style="s2">right and and but that tension can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:10.490" style="s2">you know you can think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.230" end="00:19:13.100" style="s2">generative tension that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.490" end="00:19:15.680" style="s2">creates something and you and you go you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.100" end="00:19:16.730" style="s2">know form rises around it and then you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.680" end="00:19:18.620" style="s2">get to a certain point and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.730" end="00:19:20.030" style="s2">sudden and then you go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.620" end="00:19:21.410" style="s2">null space I haven&#39;t really thought this</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.030" end="00:19:23.870" style="s2">out very much it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.410" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">something that&#39;s like kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.870" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">I&#39;ve been kind of concept I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:32.390" style="s2">been exploring but you know one more I</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:37.790" style="s2">can remember what a last thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.390" end="00:19:39.680" style="s2">to bring up last thing I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.790" end="00:19:41.810" style="s2">probably remember in two seconds Jared</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.680" end="00:19:43.790" style="s2">you want to go yeah well I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.810" end="00:19:47.810" style="s2">like kind of flesh out this this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.790" end="00:19:50.330" style="s2">versus generative tension dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.810" end="00:19:52.490" style="s2">kind of I guess using another metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.330" end="00:19:56.390" style="s2">that I think is use a lot when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.490" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">to it&#39;s like very readily available with</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.390" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">politics in the sense that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.250" end="00:20:02.360" style="s2">have to we have a conservative in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">liberal perspective and you know ideally</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.360" end="00:20:06.440" style="s2">the way that society should be working</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:08.780" style="s2">is that we&#39;re kind of the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.440" end="00:20:10.040" style="s2">perspective is kind of informing us from</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.780" end="00:20:11.930" style="s2">what we&#39;ve learned from the past and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.040" end="00:20:13.610" style="s2">what what works this progressive is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.930" end="00:20:16.190" style="s2">trying to understand how we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.610" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">change and kind of reach into operating</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.190" end="00:20:21.740" style="s2">in new new levels and when things are</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:23.850" style="s2">working well their income they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.740" end="00:20:26.549" style="s2">they&#39;re in generative tension there</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.850" end="00:20:29.160" style="s2">a dialogue something more than the then</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.549" end="00:20:31.500" style="s2">each of them is arising out of the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.160" end="00:20:35.070" style="s2">tension between the two and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.500" end="00:20:38.130" style="s2">like the metaphor of of magnets here</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.070" end="00:20:40.549" style="s2">right so the closer they get all of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.130" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">sudden we get this this this energetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.549" end="00:20:46.710" style="s2">exchange that happens but if they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">far away it vanishes and then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.710" end="00:20:49.860" style="s2">longer anything that&#39;s being generative</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:53.160" style="s2">in addition so they&#39;re just kind of both</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.860" end="00:20:55.799" style="s2">isolated and so to Jason&#39;s point right</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.160" end="00:20:57.990" style="s2">here right is like in order for us to</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.799" end="00:21:00.120" style="s2">get that generator attention to realized</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.990" end="00:21:03.929" style="s2">somebody has to occupy this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.120" end="00:21:06.510" style="s2">space in between and kind of allow them</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.929" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">to see and get closer to each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.510" end="00:21:12.510" style="s2">for something to arise out of that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.580" style="s2">dynamic I don&#39;t that&#39;s the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.510" end="00:21:17.010" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up as you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.580" end="00:21:17.970" style="s2">speaking about an adjacent generation</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.010" end="00:21:21.380" style="s2">before I hand it over to the group you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.970" end="00:21:24.330" style="s2">have any uh closing thoughts or opening</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.380" end="00:21:26.909" style="s2">one more thought it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.330" end="00:21:28.770" style="s2">unrelated but it&#39;s just one more angle</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.909" end="00:21:30.870" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking so so up until</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.770" end="00:21:32.130" style="s2">now we&#39;ve had you know we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.870" end="00:21:35.159" style="s2">different kinds of sessions we&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.130" end="00:21:36.450" style="s2">session where you know we you know we</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.159" end="00:21:38.820" style="s2">had an inquiry about what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.450" end="00:21:41.340" style="s2">internal cognitive dissonance or you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.820" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">know what kind of warring ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.340" end="00:21:44.730" style="s2">happening within yourself right and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.860" style="s2">had a whole session where you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.730" end="00:21:49.169" style="s2">people were able to express you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.860" end="00:21:51.150" style="s2">this kind of tension within themselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.169" end="00:21:53.190" style="s2">or you can you can say it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.150" end="00:21:55.260" style="s2">internalization of the of the warring</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.190" end="00:21:57.210" style="s2">ideologies or ideas or memes in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.260" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">outside world but sometimes we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.210" end="00:22:05.190" style="s2">torn apart or split right and me like</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:07.130" style="s2">the medic mediation kind of works on</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.190" end="00:22:10.230" style="s2">many levels and works within ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.130" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">and works outside and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.230" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">contemplator practice to be a memetic</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">mediator my point of view is because</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:18.299" style="s2">we&#39;re having to internalize these as</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:22.169" style="s2">dissonance and and work with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.299" end="00:22:23.429" style="s2">ourselves right and so I&#39;m wondering but</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.169" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">you know so we&#39;ve had these different</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.429" end="00:22:27.030" style="s2">kinds of sessions and now we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:28.380" style="s2">having a session where we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.030" end="00:22:29.429" style="s2">little more meta and kind of talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.380" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.429" end="00:22:33.240" style="s2">you know where&#39;s last week Jared you</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:34.740" style="s2">know I know I wasn&#39;t there but I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.240" end="00:22:36.990" style="s2">they had a conversation like with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.740" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">specific issue with a couple people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.990" end="00:22:40.410" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:43.260" style="s2">you know with these different angles on</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.410" end="00:22:44.730" style="s2">it and that was a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.260" end="00:22:46.860" style="s2">the time before that and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.730" end="00:22:49.559" style="s2">any meta thing but I like this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.860" end="00:22:51.780" style="s2">kind of rotating modes where we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.559" end="00:22:54.900" style="s2">like you know a mode we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.780" end="00:22:57.270" style="s2">kind of object level you know memes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.900" end="00:22:58.890" style="s2">mimetic tribes or whatever and then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.270" end="00:23:00.900" style="s2">know another session where we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">more internal contemplative type of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.900" end="00:23:04.289" style="s2">conversation and then you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:05.580" style="s2">every third or fourth time we had kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.289" end="00:23:07.110" style="s2">of a meta conversation because how is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.580" end="00:23:09.510" style="s2">this going you know what needs to change</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.110" end="00:23:11.190" style="s2">right but we only have the meta kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.510" end="00:23:13.080" style="s2">conversation like every third or fourth</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.190" end="00:23:15.210" style="s2">time right cuz we don&#39;t want to be meta</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.080" end="00:23:16.679" style="s2">because that you want to get into it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.210" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">well so that&#39;s that&#39;s my next thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.679" end="00:23:22.409" style="s2">yeah yeah and it&#39;s to plug our upcoming</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:23.669" style="s2">papers at the side view so you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.409" end="00:23:26.250" style="s2">you&#39;re just discussing about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.669" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">mediating the sort of personalities the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.250" end="00:23:30.630" style="s2">internal psychodynamic aspect that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.480" style="s2">think that was what you&#39;re writing about</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.630" end="00:23:35.640" style="s2">and the side view partly and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.480" end="00:23:37.650" style="s2">just as a good like you and I were</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.640" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">originally trying to co-write a paper</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.650" end="00:23:42.210" style="s2">and we couldn&#39;t mediate between each so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:43.530" style="s2">he just kind of wrote our own papers but</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.210" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">that felt like even though there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.530" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">maybe some annoyances that we were</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.419" style="s2">flying around but I think that we ended</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:50.130" style="s2">up in right relationship there because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.419" end="00:23:52.409" style="s2">think kind of papers were needed for</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.130" end="00:23:55.530" style="s2">that so I think that&#39;s coming out and at</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.409" end="00:23:58.860" style="s2">this Adam Roberts side view in next week</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.530" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">I think so I&#39;m gonna open up two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.860" end="00:24:05.760" style="s2">peer can I just add one little quick</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:07.770" style="s2">thing I&#39;m always trying to get some</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.760" end="00:24:10.620" style="s2">visual metaphor here because it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.770" end="00:24:13.620" style="s2">help my my brain but to Jason&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.620" end="00:24:16.789" style="s2">yeah like the project here is largely to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.620" end="00:24:18.450" style="s2">like kind of understand what this to</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.789" end="00:24:20.610" style="s2">understand what this minim attic</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:21.870" style="s2">mediation is because we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.610" end="00:24:24.539" style="s2">really know this is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.870" end="00:24:26.250" style="s2">figuring it out in a lot of ways I see</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.539" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">kind of like building putting a puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.250" end="00:24:34.140" style="s2">together and building a puzzle kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">requires us to spend time like you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.140" end="00:24:38.730" style="s2">very very specifically and narrowly</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.679" style="s2">focusing on the shape of each individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.730" end="00:24:42.870" style="s2">piece and how they fit together</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.679" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">the color of it you know it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.870" end="00:24:45.900" style="s2">different dynamics and then other times</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">to Jason&#39;s point like the meta</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.900" end="00:24:50.179" style="s2">conversations it&#39;s kind of us like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:51.110" style="s2">taking a step back and looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.179" end="00:24:53.149" style="s2">whole picture and being like all right</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.110" end="00:24:55.249" style="s2">now where are the gaps how is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.149" end="00:24:56.659" style="s2">connecting over here you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.249" end="00:24:58.190" style="s2">know what what areas are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.659" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">developed where should we concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.190" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:03.799" style="s2">so yeah the meta level is is you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">very kind of abroad as brought up as</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.799" end="00:25:08.509" style="s2">perspective as we can employ to figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:10.789" style="s2">out then where to go get back to putting</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.509" end="00:25:12.789" style="s2">piece by piece together yeah in my whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.789" end="00:25:16.039" style="s2">sense there is that you know this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.789" end="00:25:18.049" style="s2">memetic mediation trying to find itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.039" end="00:25:19.940" style="s2">right now collectively and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.049" end="00:25:21.830" style="s2">three of us are just like one page ahead</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.940" end="00:25:22.820" style="s2">of some people but like we&#39;re not that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.830" end="00:25:25.460" style="s2">far ahead we&#39;re not epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.820" end="00:25:27.499" style="s2">authorities of this this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.460" end="00:25:32.269" style="s2">think there&#39;s a discovery of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.499" end="00:25:35.629" style="s2">and what it could be and how to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.269" end="00:25:37.129" style="s2">if anybody I will trust everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.629" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">just unmute themselves will trust you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.129" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">discern mint if you want to like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:43.850" style="s2">disagree with us we accept your</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:46.879" style="s2">propositional violence and we will model</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.850" end="00:25:49.129" style="s2">mimetic mediation live if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.879" end="00:25:52.789" style="s2">practical ideas of what what sessions</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.129" end="00:25:54.639" style="s2">can be borne out of this we&#39;re open to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.789" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">hear that or if anything just came alive</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.639" end="00:26:08.080" style="s2">so the floor is yours sure care what the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:14.029" style="s2">role of a mediator is or how I think a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.080" end="00:26:15.649" style="s2">mediator should be sure alright sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.029" end="00:26:17.899" style="s2">I&#39;m a bit nervous you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.649" end="00:26:20.779" style="s2">first time talking in front of such big</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.899" end="00:26:23.629" style="s2">crowd and I&#39;m happy that you&#39;re all here</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.779" end="00:26:25.850" style="s2">so I&#39;ll go ahead and get started then I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.629" end="00:26:29.899" style="s2">think that a mediator has like a really</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.850" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">hard job to be able to stand outside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.899" end="00:26:34.519" style="s2">the conflict that may happen and to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:36.860" style="s2">able to just emotionally distance</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.519" end="00:26:38.629" style="s2">yourself from the crew so it&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.860" end="00:26:41.419" style="s2">that you&#39;re more likely to be attracted</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.629" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">to these emotions and so we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.419" end="00:26:48.440" style="s2">in the sort of way disciplined to make</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:53.779" style="s2">sure that do not let ourselves become</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.440" end="00:26:58.519" style="s2">bias and so when I think of like really</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.779" end="00:27:02.279" style="s2">tough decision makers it generally has</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.519" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">to be in a position where the calm</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.279" end="00:27:07.349" style="s2">unethical to do those choices so for</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:10.289" style="s2">example here a big political player you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.349" end="00:27:13.979" style="s2">might have to take policies between</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.289" end="00:27:15.989" style="s2">immigration and what I&#39;m saying here is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.979" end="00:27:18.200" style="s2">that sometimes those people are forced</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.989" end="00:27:21.809" style="s2">into situations and they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.200" end="00:27:25.169" style="s2">disciplined in their motions in order to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.809" end="00:27:29.999" style="s2">make what anything is a sensible or</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.169" end="00:27:32.879" style="s2">choice and will never ever uncover a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.999" end="00:27:35.639" style="s2">full perspective and knowledge of all</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.879" end="00:27:39.049" style="s2">these choices but the only thing in ever</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.639" end="00:27:42.839" style="s2">or is to do our best in those positions</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.049" end="00:27:45.839" style="s2">and and that&#39;s what I think why is are</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.839" end="00:27:49.259" style="s2">important and we take someone that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.839" end="00:27:51.119" style="s2">be just about any ideology but also</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.259" end="00:27:54.450" style="s2">disciplined enough to refuse it if</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.119" end="00:27:57.619" style="s2">necessary so yeah that&#39;s my take on it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.450" end="00:27:57.619" style="s2">and thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.509" end="00:28:13.779" style="s2">anybody else want to respond to that or</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.309" end="00:28:16.220" style="s2">we&#39;re coming with a different angle</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.779" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">yeah and just feel popcorn style just</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.220" end="00:28:25.159" style="s2">jump in will be awkwardly silent waiting</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:27.769" style="s2">yeah I think you know I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.159" end="00:28:32.509" style="s2">interested in each of what you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.769" end="00:28:34.070" style="s2">saying about this idea of dipping in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.509" end="00:28:36.860" style="s2">I imagined you are drawing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.070" end="00:28:39.350" style="s2">two-dimensional axis without sense and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.860" end="00:28:41.090" style="s2">propositions and you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.350" end="00:28:43.340" style="s2">happening on that access for you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.090" end="00:28:48.139" style="s2">everybody in dialogue you know as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.340" end="00:28:49.639" style="s2">speaking but one of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.139" end="00:28:52.399" style="s2">came up for me was in pneumatic</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.639" end="00:28:53.779" style="s2">mediation you know what where is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.399" end="00:28:56.120" style="s2">mediation actually is it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.779" end="00:28:59.330" style="s2">happening you know within bodies between</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.120" end="00:29:02.629" style="s2">bodies within concepts or ideas or</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.330" end="00:29:06.110" style="s2">between concepts or ideas and and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.629" end="00:29:08.809" style="s2">is the role of the tribe here and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.110" end="00:29:11.690" style="s2">how do we face conflict and do conflict</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.809" end="00:29:14.779" style="s2">and you know what does it mean to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.690" end="00:29:15.980" style="s2">between tribes to conflict you know in</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.779" end="00:29:19.809" style="s2">preference to looking sort of within</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.980" end="00:29:22.850" style="s2">tribes for conflict and in response to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.809" end="00:29:25.250" style="s2">what the last speaker was saying this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.850" end="00:29:27.379" style="s2">idea of standing outside I think is very</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.250" end="00:29:30.529" style="s2">tricky you know what might an outside</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.379" end="00:29:34.789" style="s2">space be you know in mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.529" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2">is difficult to imagine there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.789" end="00:29:37.129" style="s2">something that&#39;s alive like those are</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:39.649" style="s2">great questions I don&#39;t know the answers</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.129" end="00:29:40.129" style="s2">to it but so my kind of conception of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.649" end="00:29:43.639" style="s2">the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.129" end="00:29:45.230" style="s2">is there&#39;s like you know the biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.639" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">or the language that&#39;s being spoken</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.230" end="00:29:49.850" style="s2">there like or with our bodies is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">that primal ape and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.850" end="00:29:53.029" style="s2">emotive sphere that&#39;s for the language</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:54.980" style="s2">of emotions and felt sensor being spoken</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.029" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">and then the the noosphere that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.980" end="00:29:58.039" style="s2">realm of memes and propositions are</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">being spoken and I think you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.039" end="00:30:01.370" style="s2">have fluency in each one of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:04.940" style="s2">languages in order to speak to people</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.370" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">really well and so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.940" end="00:30:07.840" style="s2">just sort of like a skill set I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.100" style="s2">needs to be developed for not just a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.840" end="00:30:12.679" style="s2">medic mediator but a meta gamer in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.100" end="00:30:18.380" style="s2">general and I think your questions are</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.679" end="00:30:25.760" style="s2">excellent I would cease</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.380" end="00:30:28.700" style="s2">here I&#39;ve bit of an I guess outlying</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.760" end="00:30:33.800" style="s2">position on mediation where it takes</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.700" end="00:30:36.650" style="s2">place when we see it and you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.800" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">kind of publicly said I think even on</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.650" end="00:30:40.310" style="s2">our last conversation I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:41.750" style="s2">like mediation because it I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.310" end="00:30:44.450" style="s2">it as a word I think it&#39;s provocative</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.750" end="00:30:47.230" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re all here but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.450" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">think of it more as a orientation than a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.230" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">result and you know if when I see the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">most movement happening it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:04.280" style="s2">long-term all right so I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">saying is if we can find ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.280" end="00:31:10.790" style="s2">all the conversations that we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:12.890" style="s2">personal familial online on Twitter with</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.790" end="00:31:16.700" style="s2">your best friend whatever it is of kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.890" end="00:31:19.450" style="s2">of a dot of making an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.700" end="00:31:23.090" style="s2">understand multiple perspectives and not</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.450" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">trying to prove or disprove them you</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.090" end="00:31:28.070" style="s2">know as your core motivation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:30.620" style="s2">mediation happens wherever you go</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.070" end="00:31:32.750" style="s2">and maybe that word never comes up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.620" end="00:31:37.280" style="s2">probably you know I actually think of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.750" end="00:31:39.770" style="s2">probably it&#39;s it&#39;s most effective if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.280" end="00:31:42.110" style="s2">you know if we for example if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.770" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">have some of the the famous disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.110" end="00:31:47.420" style="s2">intellectuals of the stoah to come on</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:49.790" style="s2">here on the mediation campfire I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.420" end="00:31:52.010" style="s2">it would actually be like that end of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.790" end="00:31:54.260" style="s2">that conversation is likely to have not</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.010" end="00:31:56.590" style="s2">a ton of movement whereas if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.260" end="00:31:59.960" style="s2">just orient it as a campfire for</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.590" end="00:32:02.150" style="s2">relation or something like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.960" end="00:32:04.370" style="s2">but the campfire here is is pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.150" end="00:32:06.230" style="s2">the warmth though so yeah I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.370" end="00:32:11.150" style="s2">I see this is a long game and an</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.230" end="00:32:13.850" style="s2">orientation of not being pro ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.150" end="00:32:16.670" style="s2">or or you know pushing your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.850" end="00:32:18.530" style="s2">hardcore and instead kind of finding</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.670" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">ourselves often in the space in between</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.530" end="00:32:23.390" style="s2">the tribes and when that happens or in</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:26.690" style="s2">you know mediation is kind of a an</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.390" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">emergent result in a long term and one</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.690" end="00:32:29.960" style="s2">other kind of little note here too just</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:32.120" style="s2">that attack on sorry I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.960" end="00:32:34.550" style="s2">take you much time but</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.120" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">is this this question of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:39.530" style="s2">the perspectives of people and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:40.820" style="s2">that it is valuable to understand both</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.530" end="00:32:43.570" style="s2">the perspectives because we can kind of</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.540" end="00:32:51.140" style="s2">also think that that&#39;s not always</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:02.420" style="s2">I&#39;m sure kids have doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:03.470" style="s2">mediation for their parents because they</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.420" end="00:33:05.030" style="s2">have no idea what&#39;s going on and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.470" end="00:33:06.560" style="s2">ask simple questions and they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.560" end="00:33:11.740" style="s2">the the answers as opposed to having an</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.740" end="00:33:18.500" style="s2">yeah I think you know when in doubt if</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.580" end="00:33:19.940" style="s2">surprising how much work can be done</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.500" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">from coming from a place of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.940" end="00:33:27.860" style="s2">curiosity and little agenda just a few</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:31.340" style="s2">thoughts throughout there Richard</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.860" end="00:33:33.770" style="s2">Bartlett mentioned a while back that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.340" end="00:33:36.410" style="s2">mentioned the term medic diplomat and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.770" end="00:33:38.570" style="s2">actually I&#39;m being honest in the way a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.410" end="00:33:40.580" style="s2">mediation and diplomat is being used I</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.570" end="00:33:42.590" style="s2">see myself more as trying to be a medic</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.580" end="00:33:45.620" style="s2">diplomat and then a mediator because a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.590" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">mediator has you know a specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.620" end="00:33:50.360" style="s2">structure you know usually you have like</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:53.330" style="s2">the you know a couple parties and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.360" end="00:33:55.580" style="s2">third party like a mediating between two</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.330" end="00:33:57.770" style="s2">people and that&#39;s actually not like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.580" end="00:33:59.570" style="s2">like for me that&#39;s that&#39;s part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.770" end="00:34:01.040" style="s2">kind of going what Jared said it you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.570" end="00:34:02.630" style="s2">know for me it&#39;s really a lot of its</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.040" end="00:34:04.850" style="s2">informal it&#39;s just relationship building</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.630" end="00:34:07.700" style="s2">with with people who think differently</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.850" end="00:34:10.490" style="s2">than me and you know perhaps you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.700" end="00:34:12.470" style="s2">and that can be you know if if it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.490" end="00:34:14.780" style="s2">difficult to build a relationship based</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.470" end="00:34:17.300" style="s2">on ideas it can be just based on shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.780" end="00:34:20.390" style="s2">aesthetics taste right shared love with</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.300" end="00:34:22.550" style="s2">baseball or you know shared love of you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.390" end="00:34:25.880" style="s2">know listening to Bob Dylan or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.550" end="00:34:27.680" style="s2">right and you know and eventually when</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.880" end="00:34:30.350" style="s2">things flare up and there&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.680" end="00:34:32.630" style="s2">general genuine misunderstanding between</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.350" end="00:34:34.100" style="s2">groups of people you know you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.630" end="00:34:35.840" style="s2">know if you&#39;re in a position where you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.100" end="00:34:37.970" style="s2">have relationships with people on both</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.840" end="00:34:39.650" style="s2">of those sides you can kind of help</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.970" end="00:34:41.150" style="s2">transmit information back and forth with</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.650" end="00:34:42.830" style="s2">more signal than would have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.150" end="00:34:44.390" style="s2">otherwise so kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.830" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">connective tissue and so you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.390" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:50.059" style="s2">you helped to facilitate collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.419" end="00:34:57.680" style="s2">intelligence is I guess the way I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.059" end="00:34:59.809" style="s2">about it there was one of the vision one</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.680" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">of the metaphors that comes to mind for</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.809" end="00:35:03.770" style="s2">me visual metaphors that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:06.260" style="s2">for me is like is a bridge but also</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.770" end="00:35:10.270" style="s2">Jared as you were talking it was more of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.260" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">the word glue kept coming into mind and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.270" end="00:35:15.589" style="s2">being that you know Peter like he said</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:20.780" style="s2">the space in between tribes but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.589" end="00:35:23.059" style="s2">being able to you know I have I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.780" end="00:35:28.309" style="s2">that I have an ability to detect like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.059" end="00:35:31.460" style="s2">changes in volumes or tones of voice in</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.309" end="00:35:34.460" style="s2">a very subtle way and in language and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.460" end="00:35:37.220" style="s2">can see things ratcheting up and will</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.460" end="00:35:39.109" style="s2">and have in my life been known to stop</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.220" end="00:35:42.230" style="s2">something in order to prevent it from</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.109" end="00:35:46.670" style="s2">escalating any further and so being so</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.230" end="00:35:49.130" style="s2">but but also like being able to be you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.670" end="00:35:51.530" style="s2">know in the I think I&#39;ve always been the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.130" end="00:35:53.270" style="s2">type of person that will take the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.530" end="00:35:56.750" style="s2">opposite of if somebody takes a strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.270" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">position even if I in general agree with</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.750" end="00:36:02.270" style="s2">them will automatically take like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">opposite perspective just because</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.270" end="00:36:10.069" style="s2">there&#39;s this just deep desire in me for</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:13.000" style="s2">balance and so so Jason I I liked the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.069" end="00:36:16.819" style="s2">word diplomat but there&#39;s also yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.000" end="00:36:19.849" style="s2">you know sense of needing this balance</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.819" end="00:36:24.829" style="s2">that comes when someone takes a strong</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.849" end="00:36:27.349" style="s2">position and wanting to immediately like</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.829" end="00:36:30.020" style="s2">even if I even if I don&#39;t agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.349" end="00:36:31.640" style="s2">opposing position will try and present</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.020" end="00:36:36.430" style="s2">the argument of the opposing position</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.640" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">just because I like I can&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.430" end="00:36:43.280" style="s2">that imbalance and so and I see a couple</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:47.030" style="s2">of other people saying that they do the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.280" end="00:36:51.260" style="s2">same thing so that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.030" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">similar thing and and so but being able</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.260" end="00:36:55.819" style="s2">to or and one of the thoughts that came</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:36:57.859" style="s2">to my Peter you referenced like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.819" end="00:36:59.329" style="s2">three different levels and like I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.859" end="00:36:59.780" style="s2">comfortable in the emotional level like</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.329" end="00:37:01.460" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:03.740" style="s2">I know in backwards and forwards and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.460" end="00:37:06.140" style="s2">inside-out but when it comes to more of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.740" end="00:37:08.600" style="s2">the ideas and being able to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.140" end="00:37:11.390" style="s2">those on a kind of a faster rate my</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.600" end="00:37:14.810" style="s2">brain just kind of goes it and so like</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.390" end="00:37:17.990" style="s2">having a way to practice that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.810" end="00:37:19.400" style="s2">it you know is it was something that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.990" end="00:37:22.340" style="s2">coming to mind was like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:24.260" style="s2">practice at those various levels and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.340" end="00:37:26.660" style="s2">kind of getting a clear like I like I</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.260" end="00:37:29.570" style="s2">have a some sense of what you what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.660" end="00:37:31.850" style="s2">meant but getting a clearer idea of each</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.570" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">of those levels I would that would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.850" end="00:37:34.480" style="s2">really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.310" end="00:37:42.610" style="s2">yeah maybe I&#39;ve been reading a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.780" end="00:37:43.900" style="s2">bit about in my journals but so the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.610" end="00:37:46.870" style="s2">biosphere was sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.900" end="00:37:48.990" style="s2">interactions that primal miss Jared and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.870" end="00:37:51.250" style="s2">myself we were sort of dipped our or</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.990" end="00:37:53.200" style="s2">dipped into the pickup artist scene and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.250" end="00:37:56.410" style="s2">then they sort of leveraged evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.200" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">biology in order to attract women but</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.410" end="00:38:01.030" style="s2">and I&#39;m also a trainer at Dale Carnegie</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:02.980" style="s2">Training and Jonathan hight he called</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.030" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">Dale Carnegie sort of the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.980" end="00:38:06.220" style="s2">whisperer and he used the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:07.840" style="s2">the elephant the rider like system one</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.220" end="00:38:10.270" style="s2">system two and you got to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.840" end="00:38:11.620" style="s2">elephant you don&#39;t talk to the rider if</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.270" end="00:38:13.210" style="s2">you can talk to the elephant then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.620" end="00:38:15.790" style="s2">can really make friends and influence</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.210" end="00:38:17.560" style="s2">people so that&#39;s sort of like that kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.790" end="00:38:19.180" style="s2">of that primal level that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.560" end="00:38:20.970" style="s2">language that can be spoken that social</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:23.110" style="s2">skills books anything you can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.970" end="00:38:25.780" style="s2">and then the other level is the level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.110" end="00:38:27.730" style="s2">the motor sphere like what you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.780" end="00:38:29.530" style="s2">of like have a natural talent and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.730" end="00:38:31.240" style="s2">probably like where you just feel people</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.530" end="00:38:33.100" style="s2">like when things heat up things heat up</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.240" end="00:38:36.520" style="s2">in your body right and then sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.100" end="00:38:38.950" style="s2">you know you address that and and I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.520" end="00:38:40.390" style="s2">feel people&#39;s words right and when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.950" end="00:38:43.840" style="s2">zone out when everyone the word feels</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.390" end="00:38:45.550" style="s2">the same it feels disembodied so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.840" end="00:38:48.040" style="s2">sort of like the if you can speak at</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.550" end="00:38:50.260" style="s2">that language then it&#39;s like you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.040" end="00:38:52.030" style="s2">kind of ignore some of the the red</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.260" end="00:38:53.110" style="s2">herrings in the propositional realm and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.030" end="00:38:54.760" style="s2">then really get at the heart what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.110" end="00:38:56.950" style="s2">person is trying to say and this is sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:38:58.840" style="s2">of what Jordan holiday and I smoked a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.950" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">burger called the Omega roll just really</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.840" end="00:39:02.230" style="s2">really listen and then the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">that run with the proposition and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.230" end="00:39:05.140" style="s2">someone said what about objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:06.790" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like in that realm like</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.140" end="00:39:08.530" style="s2">is there an objective truth lift can we</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.790" end="00:39:09.910" style="s2">level set on it and this is where things</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.530" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">get really messy though because if</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.910" end="00:39:13.240" style="s2">anyone read my paper in the culture with</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">that spreadsheet there&#39;s a lot of people</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:19.000" style="s2">are flying around and if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.870" end="00:39:20.110" style="s2">really skilled at being meta and Jason</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.000" end="00:39:21.880" style="s2">and I were talking about this in one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.110" end="00:39:23.980" style="s2">our letter exchanges I think I called</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.880" end="00:39:25.510" style="s2">the perspectival pigeon ISM it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.980" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">you can kind of take mental models from</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.510" end="00:39:29.290" style="s2">each one of these tribes create your own</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:30.790" style="s2">sort of respect type of language and use</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.290" end="00:39:32.440" style="s2">the right model for the right person at</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.790" end="00:39:33.400" style="s2">the right time so if you&#39;re coming with</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.440" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">someone who has a social justice</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.400" end="00:39:36.610" style="s2">proclivity you can use hierarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:37.990" style="s2">something like that if you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.610" end="00:39:39.940" style="s2">someone with a reactionary you can use</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.990" end="00:39:42.100" style="s2">nan and then you can kind of speak to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.020" style="s2">them and relate to them on that level so</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.100" end="00:39:45.790" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like what I understand is</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.020" end="00:39:47.170" style="s2">the metagame and I don&#39;t know no</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.790" end="00:39:48.520" style="s2">training out there for it so maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.170" end="00:39:49.500" style="s2">invent one here at the stoah but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.520" end="00:39:55.170" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.500" end="00:39:56.730" style="s2">at the edge of my thinking and above the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.170" end="00:40:01.230" style="s2">last sentence you said Peter about</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.730" end="00:40:08.190" style="s2">training weight before and I think would</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.230" end="00:40:09.870" style="s2">be probably like almost like to bring</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.190" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">things from here on to the real world</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.870" end="00:40:14.250" style="s2">almost kind of like homework our</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">missions reminded kind of like in Fight</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:16.920" style="s2">Club where they got that envelope sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:19.560" style="s2">of like you have to go in to find</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.920" end="00:40:21.180" style="s2">something like that where it be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.560" end="00:40:22.140" style="s2">something that people here who would be</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.180" end="00:40:24.300" style="s2">interested in the best kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.140" end="00:40:27.870" style="s2">invitation try to do like this one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.300" end="00:40:29.310" style="s2">and in the field of memory Asian and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.870" end="00:40:30.750" style="s2">then you can kind of come back and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.310" end="00:40:32.580" style="s2">for your field observations like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.750" end="00:40:34.440" style="s2">did you see what did not work probably</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.580" end="00:40:36.870" style="s2">the first couple of times or what was</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:38.370" style="s2">too easy here and I wondered that could</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.870" end="00:40:39.960" style="s2">kind of also create internal training</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.370" end="00:40:41.790" style="s2">program for everybody&#39;s interested to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.960" end="00:40:45.030" style="s2">give people ideas some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.790" end="00:40:49.400" style="s2">accountability and also kind of create</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.030" end="00:40:49.400" style="s2">the knowledge base to develop this</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.940" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">yeah like that um hello everybody thank</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.750" end="00:41:08.549" style="s2">you for all the effort and energy</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:11.049" style="s2">everyone&#39;s put in so far my name is Ben</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.549" end="00:41:14.160" style="s2">and I want to be mindful first of all</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.049" end="00:41:18.369" style="s2">the first stoic session I attended was</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.160" end="00:41:22.180" style="s2">building the stoah and the mediator of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.369" end="00:41:25.809" style="s2">that session travis warned against</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.180" end="00:41:28.690" style="s2">bringing a cathedral and recommended</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.809" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">bringing a brick and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.690" end="00:41:33.880" style="s2">that I may not be doing here and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:35.700" style="s2">David who&#39;s in attendance we I brought</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.880" end="00:41:38.530" style="s2">this up and actually Peter I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.700" end="00:41:42.339" style="s2">mentioned a project to you and a DM on</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.530" end="00:41:45.609" style="s2">Twitter about a way sort of my demonic</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.339" end="00:41:48.819" style="s2">reaction to reading the cultural war</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.609" end="00:41:55.210" style="s2">paper I immediately went out and bought</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.819" end="00:41:58.839" style="s2">the URL called reality museum org and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.210" end="00:42:01.839" style="s2">guess this is sort of linked somewhat to</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.839" end="00:42:06.490" style="s2">Jordan Hall&#39;s idea of a news channel um</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.839" end="00:42:09.279" style="s2">but it also relies on a a visual</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.490" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">metaphor sort of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.279" end="00:42:15.039" style="s2">perspectives as frameworks and I just</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:19.630" style="s2">had this vision for creating a website</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.039" end="00:42:23.170" style="s2">in which a essentially a museum was was</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.630" end="00:42:27.880" style="s2">built off of set of reality tunnels</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.170" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">their gallery spaces and I should say -</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.880" end="00:42:34.450" style="s2">on to Jason&#39;s point about my own biases</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.760" style="s2">I&#39;m a visual person I come from the Art</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.450" end="00:42:39.400" style="s2">and Design background so I always</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.760" end="00:42:42.339" style="s2">gravitate this way but I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.400" end="00:42:45.520" style="s2">wanting to get some momentum under this</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.339" end="00:42:47.160" style="s2">idea and I ironically picked a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.539" style="s2">collaborator who at we ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.160" end="00:42:52.690" style="s2">couldn&#39;t mediate between our two</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.539" end="00:42:56.349" style="s2">different sort of outlooks on the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.690" end="00:42:59.170" style="s2">but um anyhow I just it&#39;s very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.349" end="00:43:02.309" style="s2">for me - thinking in a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.170" end="00:43:05.680" style="s2">cohesive visual metaphor and this one</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.309" end="00:43:08.550" style="s2">the role of the mediator becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.680" end="00:43:11.170" style="s2">like a docent so a volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.550" end="00:43:13.690" style="s2">who&#39;s familiar with all the galleries in</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.170" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">the museum and doesn&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.690" end="00:43:20.260" style="s2">to like the frameworks in one gallery</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.680" end="00:43:22.540" style="s2">but should know all these galleries are</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.260" end="00:43:26.980" style="s2">here and this is how other people see</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.540" end="00:43:30.839" style="s2">the world and anyhow I just wanted to to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.980" end="00:43:33.579" style="s2">share and mostly to to say thank you to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.839" end="00:43:40.300" style="s2">Peter and Jared and Jason and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.579" end="00:43:42.550" style="s2">else I found I found I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.300" end="00:43:47.500" style="s2">intriguing one one thing that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.550" end="00:43:50.520" style="s2">for me is a from my perspective I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.500" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">think anybody would ever be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.520" end="00:43:57.010" style="s2">understand enough you know the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.730" end="00:43:58.300" style="s2">mimetic landscape like it so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.010" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">you were to have something to develop</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.300" end="00:44:01.300" style="s2">them like that seems like you need a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.180" style="s2">of collaborators from people from</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.300" end="00:44:05.710" style="s2">different backgrounds to help curate and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.180" end="00:44:08.619" style="s2">that&#39;s probably we had in mind anyway</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.710" end="00:44:11.410" style="s2">right because I don&#39;t think you know me</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.619" end="00:44:14.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like mimetic mediators is like we</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.410" end="00:44:16.210" style="s2">kind of have to lock arms and try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.440" end="00:44:18.640" style="s2">cover the whole space and many of us are</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.210" end="00:44:20.770" style="s2">gonna come from you know way more on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.640" end="00:44:24.010" style="s2">right maybe more on the anarchist or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.770" end="00:44:26.140" style="s2">you know from the left or you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.010" end="00:44:28.030" style="s2">know all over the place and work you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.140" end="00:44:29.859" style="s2">know each of us it has probably a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.030" end="00:44:34.390" style="s2">special set of skills mediating between</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.859" end="00:44:36.190" style="s2">certain kind of meta clusters but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.390" end="00:44:37.960" style="s2">don&#39;t at least I can you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.190" end="00:44:39.730" style="s2">even imagine trying to cover all of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.960" end="00:44:42.369" style="s2">understanding them well enough to like</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.730" end="00:44:44.589" style="s2">like I couldn&#39;t go into queueing on like</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.369" end="00:44:46.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no freaking way like I would try</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.589" end="00:44:48.190" style="s2">and do that but you know but if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.630" end="00:44:49.480" style="s2">else can and then I can mediate with</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.190" end="00:44:51.730" style="s2">them it&#39;s like there&#39;s these multiple</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.480" end="00:44:53.710" style="s2">levels where the mediators media with</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.730" end="00:44:55.690" style="s2">each other and but then they all cover</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.710" end="00:44:57.190" style="s2">you know different different parts of</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.690" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">the map but then they come back together</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.190" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">and hash out any any remaining issues</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.190" end="00:45:06.369" style="s2">among themselves yeah I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:09.849" style="s2">that was helpful or if benefits if that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.369" end="00:45:13.150" style="s2">was relevant to your idea absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.849" end="00:45:16.710" style="s2">it&#39;s for more than I could chew by</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.150" end="00:45:16.710" style="s2">myself but yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.010" end="00:45:45.900" style="s2">something else that is coming up also</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.990" end="00:45:48.150" style="s2">from the museum idea and also from</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.900" end="00:45:51.600" style="s2">before the whole mediation and concept</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.150" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">is kind of the role of not the mediator</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.600" end="00:45:57.000" style="s2">who&#39;s outside the group but the person</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:58.530" style="s2">is inside the group which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.000" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">that pretty much everybody has some sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.530" end="00:46:03.420" style="s2">of identity to a certain extent um there</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">was an ideology or some of the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.420" end="00:46:07.380" style="s2">tribe and I wonder if there could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:10.230" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.380" end="00:46:11.700" style="s2">mediation not being a third party of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.230" end="00:46:13.470" style="s2">being one of the two people in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.700" end="00:46:15.240" style="s2">two-party rule we&#39;re coming as</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.470" end="00:46:17.070" style="s2">representative I don&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.240" end="00:46:19.350" style="s2">stronger effect where someone would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.070" end="00:46:22.890" style="s2">oh I am a neo reactionary I want a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.350" end="00:46:26.370" style="s2">monarchy and and from that position I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.890" end="00:46:28.590" style="s2">want to talk to somebody who is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.370" end="00:46:30.450" style="s2">know help said that would be I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.590" end="00:46:36.620" style="s2">Democrat I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.450" end="00:46:38.790" style="s2">- so anyone&#39;s a democracy but I want I</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.620" end="00:46:42.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have that would that would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.790" end="00:46:45.810" style="s2">more powerful than being a third party</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.260" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">well I think we&#39;re all insiders in some</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.810" end="00:46:51.180" style="s2">in some mimetic clusters right like we</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:54.060" style="s2">all that&#39;s that relates back to you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.180" end="00:46:56.070" style="s2">putting our biases on our sleeves is</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.060" end="00:46:58.170" style="s2">because we are all coming from a place</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.070" end="00:46:59.850" style="s2">and and that&#39;s perhaps where we can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.170" end="00:47:02.340" style="s2">the most effective is if we can see our</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.850" end="00:47:04.980" style="s2">own biases and know the third biases but</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.340" end="00:47:07.230" style="s2">we can also represent that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:11.490" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s constructive you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.230" end="00:47:14.100" style="s2">when engaging another perspective so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.490" end="00:47:16.830" style="s2">got that question maybe for Jason bills</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.100" end="00:47:17.940" style="s2">for the group about the bias is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.830" end="00:47:20.670" style="s2">putting it on your sleeve and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.940" end="00:47:22.110" style="s2">that I&#39;m becoming more bold in my</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.670" end="00:47:23.940" style="s2">writing just kind of like speaking my</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.110" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">truth but I&#39;m speaking in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.940" end="00:47:27.600" style="s2">where you know I could be disabused of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:30.870" style="s2">the propositions if presented with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.600" end="00:47:32.190" style="s2">good argument but like you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.870" end="00:47:33.900" style="s2">talking about like masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.190" end="00:47:35.100" style="s2">feminine type stuff and at times even</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.900" end="00:47:37.410" style="s2">though I don&#39;t consider myself a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.100" end="00:47:40.440" style="s2">conservative its might sound like it to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.410" end="00:47:43.980" style="s2">some and so there&#39;s like a sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.440" end="00:47:45.710" style="s2">of getting cancelled for myself if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.980" end="00:47:49.170" style="s2">too bold with</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.710" end="00:47:51.750" style="s2">my thoughts out there because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.170" end="00:47:54.420" style="s2">if you just take one snippet of what I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.750" end="00:47:56.130" style="s2">said propositional e and then without</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.420" end="00:47:57.810" style="s2">the context of the whole letter or even</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.130" end="00:47:59.880" style="s2">that context of the spirit of how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.810" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">writing and then you almost fossilized</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.880" end="00:48:05.310" style="s2">me as sort of like this disembodied</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:06.660" style="s2">proposition that&#39;s wrong and evil so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.310" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">haven&#39;t figured out how to be a right</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.660" end="00:48:09.840" style="s2">relationship with that but I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.970" style="s2">what you think about that how does a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.840" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">medic mediator sort of play chess with</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.970" end="00:48:21.420" style="s2">canceled culture is it&#39;s the Jim Jason</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:24.410" style="s2">and in the whole group I would say very</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.420" end="00:48:27.060" style="s2">skillfully I think I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.410" end="00:48:30.090" style="s2">the talents that can be developed as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.060" end="00:48:33.510" style="s2">mediator is is learning learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.090" end="00:48:36.060" style="s2">speak truth in a way that avoids the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.510" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">really obvious triggers that will get</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.060" end="00:48:40.770" style="s2">you canceled of course you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.150" end="00:48:43.110" style="s2">people know that now you know I I know</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.770" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">that&#39;s for example you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.110" end="00:48:49.290" style="s2">knee reactionaries on Twitter are very</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">good at speaking in code right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.290" end="00:48:52.170" style="s2">getting their truths across to each</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.120" style="s2">other and to some on the app you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.170" end="00:48:58.020" style="s2">without getting cancelled you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.120" end="00:49:00.420" style="s2">so but but at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.020" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">that also might feel limiting as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.420" end="00:49:04.770" style="s2">like oh I have to I have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:07.140" style="s2">which word I&#39;m gonna use because this</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.770" end="00:49:09.030" style="s2">one is unnecessarily triggering but</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.140" end="00:49:10.530" style="s2">there also might be case where it</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.030" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter like the truth you want</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.530" end="00:49:13.470" style="s2">to express</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:15.090" style="s2">there&#39;s no papering over it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.470" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s gonna trigger people as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.090" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">and that and in that case that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:24.390" style="s2">know you know that it might there might</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:26.220" style="s2">be a time in a place where you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.390" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2">take that risk and there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.220" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.100" end="00:49:37.170" style="s2">unnecessary triggers I don&#39;t know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:39.450" style="s2">just wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.170" end="00:49:43.079" style="s2">multiple perspectives and multiple</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.450" end="00:49:46.230" style="s2">voices and thinking about you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.079" end="00:49:50.040" style="s2">their attention between sort of really</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.230" end="00:49:52.710" style="s2">wanting to find you know one voice and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.040" end="00:49:56.010" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to really try and follow</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.710" end="00:49:59.609" style="s2">a particular singular thread compared to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.010" end="00:50:03.589" style="s2">you know inviting you know other voices</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.609" end="00:50:03.589" style="s2">other perspectives into the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.990" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">so jump in um like I think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.730" end="00:50:12.660" style="s2">really good opportunity for anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:14.250" style="s2">hasn&#39;t like spoken yet we have about ten</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.660" end="00:50:15.720" style="s2">minutes so if anyone hasn&#39;t spoken yet</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.250" end="00:50:19.609" style="s2">and wants to answer that question to</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.720" end="00:50:19.609" style="s2">share their thoughts feel free to do so</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.020" end="00:50:28.440" style="s2">could you rephrase it I&#39;m Ben I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.549" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">little I&#39;m a little confused exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.440" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re asking could you rephrase it</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.609" end="00:50:41.309" style="s2">well maybe some of the some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.040" end="00:50:44.280" style="s2">or even skills or activities that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.309" end="00:50:48.809" style="s2">been presented I&#39;ve been around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.280" end="00:50:52.109" style="s2">for example of a single tension and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.809" end="00:50:53.790" style="s2">in a sense it might be easier to bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.109" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">in a second and a third and a fourth</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.790" end="00:51:00.569" style="s2">tension where the focus is on one so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:04.819" style="s2">know what&#39;s it what&#39;s it made maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.569" end="00:51:04.819" style="s2">makes more sense to have a single focus</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.420" end="00:51:21.380" style="s2">that&#39;s coming again a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.670" end="00:51:21.380" style="s2">collaboration of a few different people</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.410" end="00:51:29.059" style="s2">airing our own biases right like really</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.150" end="00:51:33.780" style="s2">fundamentally this is like admitting</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.059" end="00:51:34.619" style="s2">that none of us are not everyone of us</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.780" end="00:51:37.579" style="s2">is a hypocrite</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.619" end="00:51:40.859" style="s2">right we hold we have a ton of different</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.579" end="00:51:42.750" style="s2">beliefs identifications and the closer</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.859" end="00:51:45.059" style="s2">we look at them we realized that they a</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.750" end="00:51:46.920" style="s2">lot of intersections where they does</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.059" end="00:51:49.290" style="s2">they&#39;re in a disagreement with each</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.920" end="00:51:50.040" style="s2">other and so this is kind of pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.290" end="00:51:55.410" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.040" end="00:51:57.390" style="s2">but there&#39;s holes in our story and one</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.410" end="00:51:58.920" style="s2">of the simplest practices here is like</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.390" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">is being aware of that I mean be like</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.920" end="00:52:02.460" style="s2">really like well how do out what what</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:07.320" style="s2">are some of the areas that that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.460" end="00:52:10.040" style="s2">agree from from my of my own beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.320" end="00:52:12.840" style="s2">things like that and that can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.040" end="00:52:14.850" style="s2">start to highlight not only the space in</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.840" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">between the concepts but the space that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.850" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">permeates all of the concepts too and</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:21.720" style="s2">both of these things kind of give you a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:23.910" style="s2">little bit more release and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.720" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">less capture and kind of constriction</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.910" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">around the ideas and Bend to your point</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:30.540" style="s2">I think this is really important to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:33.420" style="s2">think of when we&#39;re in a mediation</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.540" end="00:52:35.930" style="s2">perspective and and and I like the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.420" end="00:52:38.970" style="s2">plurality role right like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.930" end="00:52:41.400" style="s2">confuse people by using conservative</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.970" end="00:52:45.090" style="s2">language to describe a liberal or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.400" end="00:52:46.440" style="s2">progressive ideal that with words that</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.090" end="00:52:48.120" style="s2">would normally trigger them so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.440" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">you know all of a sudden they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.120" end="00:52:51.420" style="s2">whoa like this is the this is like an</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:52.980" style="s2">idea that&#39;s pulling in like five</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.420" end="00:52:55.140" style="s2">different conflicting things and it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.980" end="00:52:57.630" style="s2">makes me uncomfortable and and and kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.140" end="00:52:59.490" style="s2">of a little ungrounded maybe looking</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.630" end="00:53:01.950" style="s2">around to try and figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.490" end="00:53:03.210" style="s2">going on into Kyra&#39;s point to like often</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.950" end="00:53:04.560" style="s2">we know this is devil&#39;s advocate</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.210" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">sometimes we can think of it as like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.560" end="00:53:08.520" style="s2">everything has an opposite but I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.290" style="s2">it&#39;s even more multi-dimensional or than</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.520" end="00:53:13.730" style="s2">that you know if a concept is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.290" end="00:53:16.560" style="s2">some sort of each one has its own shape</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.730" end="00:53:21.360" style="s2">any anywhere around and this is a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.560" end="00:53:23.970" style="s2">shape - it&#39;s not not just a circle but</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.660" end="00:53:35.700" style="s2">together can be explored challenged</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.870" end="00:53:37.800" style="s2">questioned and and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.700" end="00:53:39.090" style="s2">that I find the most useful to get to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.800" end="00:53:41.760" style="s2">Google to start loosening some of their</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.090" end="00:53:43.770" style="s2">grip on ideology is to like look for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.760" end="00:53:45.270" style="s2">places that are less clear for them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.770" end="00:53:47.250" style="s2">then all the sudden to be coming up this</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.270" end="00:53:50.010" style="s2">idea that they had a solid idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.250" end="00:53:52.110" style="s2">something was starts to be challenged a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.010" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">little bit when we try and understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.110" end="00:53:55.470" style="s2">where the boundary is we really look</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:56.070" style="s2">closely and see that&#39;s like well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.470" end="00:53:58.710" style="s2">not quite there</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.070" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">so yeah this isn&#39;t you know ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.710" end="00:54:03.240" style="s2">nebulosity kind of open this like these</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:03.840" style="s2">are all all things you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.240" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">where meeting</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.840" end="00:54:10.680" style="s2">arises from and the rigidity of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:13.110" style="s2">and ideas that we have captured is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.680" end="00:54:14.490" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to you know to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.110" end="00:54:16.620" style="s2">break those apart and let them relate</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.490" end="00:54:18.930" style="s2">and see each other we you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.620" end="00:54:21.540" style="s2">million ways to kind of introduce a</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.930" end="00:54:22.920" style="s2">little bit of space and it comes in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.540" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">lot of flavors but unfortunately this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.920" end="00:54:27.840" style="s2">an uncomfortable process yeah just just</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:29.640" style="s2">a few thoughts to kind of go in here and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.840" end="00:54:34.730" style="s2">make things a little bit more complex</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.640" end="00:54:41.760" style="s2">abstract sorry can I speak to softest</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.730" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">sure yeah so I feed also it sim as</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.760" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">written for this question of bin and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:51.140" style="s2">what I was trying to particularly to</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:55.590" style="s2">earlier like last week we had this</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.140" end="00:54:59.400" style="s2">example of mediation between about</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.590" end="00:55:03.090" style="s2">Israel and so I think in to have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.400" end="00:55:07.470" style="s2">relationship to truth as actually we all</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.090" end="00:55:08.520" style="s2">have a relationship to truth in all ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.470" end="00:55:10.950" style="s2">we could not have a conversation without</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.520" end="00:55:13.050" style="s2">having some sort of relationship and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.950" end="00:55:15.360" style="s2">I think it&#39;s not just about biases it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.050" end="00:55:18.230" style="s2">also about something outside of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.360" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">ourselves like yeah so for Sam Israel so</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.230" end="00:55:22.710" style="s2">we need to be able to talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.420" style="s2">the history and so that can be different</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.710" end="00:55:27.270" style="s2">sides to it but still as a grounding</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.420" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">like say what happened in 1970 or 1980</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.270" end="00:55:32.900" style="s2">or who did what my kids so yeah so there</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.270" end="00:55:35.310" style="s2">can be different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.900" end="00:55:37.290" style="s2">interpretations and even facts can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.310" end="00:55:41.070" style="s2">disagreed upon but still I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.290" end="00:55:43.380" style="s2">this level of what the content is like I</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.070" end="00:55:45.360" style="s2">think content is for me the best word</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.380" end="00:55:47.940" style="s2">that we need to have a relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.360" end="00:55:52.110" style="s2">and how to have a relationship with but</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.940" end="00:55:53.790" style="s2">conscience is also part of mediation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.110" end="00:55:55.050" style="s2">also so yeah if it&#39;s something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.790" end="00:55:56.520" style="s2">know so much about then you would have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.050" end="00:55:58.410" style="s2">different relationship than if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.520" end="00:56:00.540" style="s2">expert like if you&#39;re an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.410" end="00:56:03.870" style="s2">Israel history then you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.540" end="00:56:06.180" style="s2">different mediation than if you were not</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.870" end="00:56:10.660" style="s2">known as one in this area</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.180" end="00:56:13.630" style="s2">thank you so um we got three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.660" end="00:56:15.490" style="s2">left so if one person one person has</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.630" end="00:56:27.790" style="s2">closed your thoughts anyone does it all</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.490" end="00:56:29.800" style="s2">make some closing announcements Jason or</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.790" end="00:56:30.370" style="s2">Jared if you guys want to you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.800" end="00:56:35.740" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.370" end="00:56:38.560" style="s2">I mean mind is trying to think of a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.740" end="00:56:42.810" style="s2">to summarize and you know in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.560" end="00:56:44.740" style="s2">kind of leads us directly forward</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.810" end="00:56:50.890" style="s2">grasping but it&#39;s not finding anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.740" end="00:56:52.840" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s okay I feel like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.890" end="00:56:55.120" style="s2">different ideas are kind of floating</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.840" end="00:56:58.090" style="s2">around and we might need a few or more</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.120" end="00:57:00.370" style="s2">of these sessions to or some something</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.090" end="00:57:03.190" style="s2">to start to cohere in terms of you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.370" end="00:57:05.320" style="s2">either more of a formalized training is</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.190" end="00:57:08.230" style="s2">I think someone recommended or you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.320" end="00:57:12.480" style="s2">perhaps some actual using the space for</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.230" end="00:57:14.560" style="s2">actual mediation but yeah I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.480" end="00:57:17.830" style="s2">guess it&#39;s still a little bit liminal</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.560" end="00:57:19.300" style="s2">for me right so so I have a practical</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.830" end="00:57:20.320" style="s2">idea that we can throw it there and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.300" end="00:57:22.330" style="s2">say what I liked and didn&#39;t like about</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.320" end="00:57:25.930" style="s2">the session what I liked about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.330" end="00:57:28.270" style="s2">session was I don&#39;t often talk about at</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.930" end="00:57:30.280" style="s2">the edge of my thinking aloud so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.270" end="00:57:32.380" style="s2">was a good opportunity and then like I</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.280" end="00:57:35.410" style="s2">like hearing Jason and Jared to think I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.380" end="00:57:36.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t like about it it&#39;s so Jason Jared</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.410" end="00:57:38.980" style="s2">and myself we have the proclivity to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.640" end="00:57:40.300" style="s2">masturbate about the meta okay it just</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.980" end="00:57:42.460" style="s2">felt like we were masturbating in front</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.300" end="00:57:46.180" style="s2">of you all for a little bit and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.460" end="00:57:47.530" style="s2">it&#39;s okay but as a facilitator in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.180" end="00:57:49.330" style="s2">space of the story I want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.530" end="00:57:50.710" style="s2">about us the collective intelligence not</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.330" end="00:57:54.010" style="s2">about what this perceived epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.710" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">Authority we are so that can be totally</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.010" end="00:57:56.440" style="s2">missed reading that whole situation</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:57:58.780" style="s2">people and then I felt that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.440" end="00:58:00.520" style="s2">sort of what I&#39;m leaving with I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.780" end="00:58:03.100" style="s2">you don&#39;t like about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.520" end="00:58:04.930" style="s2">meta modern masturbation can I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.100" end="00:58:05.950" style="s2">know okay there&#39;s a secret handshake for</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.930" end="00:58:10.090" style="s2">it I don&#39;t know if you want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.950" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">that right now so an idea so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.090" end="00:58:14.170" style="s2">slack group I&#39;m a medic mediator slack</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">group and David just created a mediation</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.170" end="00:58:18.790" style="s2">campfire a channel on it so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:19.620" style="s2">could maybe I don&#39;t know who has a link</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.790" end="00:58:21.270" style="s2">to that some of the pose</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.620" end="00:58:22.770" style="s2">that link in the chat box you her to</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.270" end="00:58:24.420" style="s2">join it and let&#39;s just spit ball</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.770" end="00:58:26.520" style="s2">throughout the week about what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.420" end="00:58:27.960" style="s2">here because it&#39;s just me and Jason</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.520" end="00:58:29.070" style="s2">Jared just come kind of coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.960" end="00:58:31.050" style="s2">it ourselves but we can collectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.070" end="00:58:32.970" style="s2">come up with an idea and just run with</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.050" end="00:58:34.140" style="s2">it and we&#39;re as you can tell from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.970" end="00:58:39.090" style="s2">previous sessions were really really</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.140" end="00:58:40.170" style="s2">open to experiment with this so that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.090" end="00:58:41.070" style="s2">being said Jason Jared you have any</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.170" end="00:58:43.110" style="s2">closing thoughts before I make</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.070" end="00:58:48.390" style="s2">announcements to about coming events at</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.110" end="00:58:50.070" style="s2">the store mm-hmm no I think if getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.390" end="00:58:52.230" style="s2">some more dialogue going throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.070" end="00:58:54.810" style="s2">week you know in this channel I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.230" end="00:58:56.490" style="s2">would be good so we can kind of flesh</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.810" end="00:58:58.050" style="s2">out some of these ideas that people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.490" end="00:58:59.490" style="s2">been putting out and we&#39;ve you know we</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.050" end="00:59:01.980" style="s2">haven&#39;t had we haven&#39;t had the time to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.490" end="00:59:03.930" style="s2">really you know carefully go through</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.980" end="00:59:05.430" style="s2">each one so I think if people want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.930" end="00:59:12.450" style="s2">join that I think that would be a really</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.430" end="00:59:15.720" style="s2">good way to you know yep one quick kind</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.450" end="00:59:18.270" style="s2">of note on the bias discussion well I</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.720" end="00:59:20.580" style="s2">think bias is a very real thing and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.270" end="00:59:22.110" style="s2">a good lens to use when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.580" end="00:59:25.980" style="s2">understand how people make decisions I</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.110" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">think from the mediation toolkit I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.980" end="00:59:31.410" style="s2">find it super valuable and and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.740" end="00:59:32.490" style="s2">actually prefer just perspective you</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.410" end="00:59:35.310" style="s2">know this is kind of a radical</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.490" end="00:59:38.430" style="s2">relativism but due to utility rather</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.310" end="00:59:41.460" style="s2">than any kind of ultimate to truth and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.430" end="00:59:43.820" style="s2">and yeah if we&#39;re genuinely interacting</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.460" end="00:59:46.170" style="s2">with people in a in a from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.820" end="00:59:46.860" style="s2">just trying to understand everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.170" end="00:59:49.050" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.860" end="00:59:50.790" style="s2">I forget actually it&#39;s far more fruitful</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.050" end="00:59:52.980" style="s2">rather than kind of bringing in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.790" end="00:59:57.210" style="s2">negative connotation of who&#39;s biases are</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.980" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2">gonna cause problems so just a little</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.210" end="01:00:01.140" style="s2">thought on that and then last thing as</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.950" end="01:00:05.460" style="s2">we&#39;re closing Peter I know we did</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.140" end="01:00:07.980" style="s2">mention the the play play acting role</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.460" end="01:00:09.960" style="s2">and and I love Ben you know Benjamin</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.980" end="01:00:13.350" style="s2">saying that if anyone wanted to be like</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.960" end="01:00:17.400" style="s2">hey I&#39;m I&#39;m this somebody want to argue</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.350" end="01:00:19.080" style="s2">against it yeah like I&#39;m very much I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.400" end="01:00:20.910" style="s2">open to triggering anybody that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.080" end="01:00:24.450" style="s2">like to be triggered so you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.910" end="01:00:27.540" style="s2">invitations are out there and yeah so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.450" end="01:00:29.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a perspective I might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.540" end="01:00:31.620" style="s2">even do it ignorantly those are some of</p>
