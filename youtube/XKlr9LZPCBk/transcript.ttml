<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:07.080" style="s2">I wanted to make this video to comment</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">on John Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:11.849" style="s2">Peterson and Brett Weinstein and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:12.450" style="s2">particular talking about Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.849" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.450" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">part where he talks about the Pareto</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">distribution and he it&#39;s a national</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">phenomenon when we have a population</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:27.630" style="s2">working on a problem creating any kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:29.130" style="s2">of outcome it&#39;s going to district that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.630" end="00:00:31.650" style="s2">outcomes going to distribute itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.130" end="00:00:32.910" style="s2">unevenly so the idea of the preeto</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.650" end="00:00:34.710" style="s2">distribution is that whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.910" end="00:00:37.380" style="s2">population is the square root of it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.710" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">going to produce 50 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.380" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">results so if there&#39;s a million farmers</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">a thousand of them are going to produce</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">half of the field a half of the food</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">yield if there are ten farmers three of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">them are gonna produce half of the of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">the food he acts like the more and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">understand why but he acts like the more</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">people are involved in it the worse it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.129" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">is and yes in math that is true three is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.850" style="s2">thirty percent of ten whereas a million</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:09.900" style="s2">like is one tenth of one percent</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.850" end="00:01:12.659" style="s2">thousand is one tenth of one percent of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.900" end="00:01:15.060" style="s2">a million the issue is that those three</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.659" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">people in the ten don&#39;t even make it on</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.060" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">the radar in the million so the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:21.330" style="s2">people that are competing the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">people that are part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">distribution the better the outcome is</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">going to be which means it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">million people to create those thousand</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:32.670" style="s2">people with the higher yield it takes</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">ten people to create the three people so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.670" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">the more people we have on the field</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">competing the higher the bar is going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">be set to be part of that square root</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">and so to say that that person then gets</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:47.070" style="s2">all of the spoils of everything and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:48.930" style="s2">get to have a better outcome at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.070" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">beginning of the next round is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.930" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">capitalism does capitalism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">responsible for the pre dough</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">distribution but it is responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">the gross inequality in the power and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">authority that you get because you have</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">a higher competency in a different video</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">Jordan talks about this coin flip game</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">where you flip a coin if you lose you</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">give someone your dollar and then at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:13.020" style="s2">end one person has all the money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:15.180" style="s2">not the pre distribution Peter</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.020" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">sturbation would be you have thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.180" end="00:02:19.080" style="s2">people in a room you flip everyone gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:21.510" style="s2">to participate in ten rounds and at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.080" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">end how many of them had ten tails those</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.510" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">people are the winner how many had Ted</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:28.890" style="s2">ten heads those people are the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">loser they weren&#39;t better people in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.890" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">it&#39;s just as hard to get ten tails as it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:38.120" style="s2">is to get ten heads but we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">the game in a way that it&#39;s unfair like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">everyone has an equal chance of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.620" style="s2">that one person but then once they get</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">that position we say that they earned it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">we say that that is exactly it took a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">thousand people to to be part of that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">have the chance of one person being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:58.020" style="s2">to get all heads and so the more we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">able to make society fair the more were</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.020" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">able to create a foundation of our needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">being met the more people that are to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.880" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">play the game the more people have</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.510" style="s2">access to musical instruments the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:10.500" style="s2">likely they are to be the best composer</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.510" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">sorry they&#39;re not more likely to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.500" end="00:03:15.830" style="s2">best composer but society&#39;s more likely</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">to create a better and better composer</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:23.490" style="s2">and so making sure everybody&#39;s needs are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">met means owning that pre distribution</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.490" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t give you obscene wealth you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:28.050" style="s2">already won</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.520" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">you already got to be the best composer</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.050" end="00:03:33.090" style="s2">you&#39;re already that one that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">thousand in the million so why should</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.090" end="00:03:44.250" style="s2">you also get all of the resources there</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:46.500" style="s2">are some places where you&#39;re - where</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.250" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">your competency is rewarded in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">places where your competency is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.590" style="s2">rewarded if you would be the best brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">surgeon and get lots of money but</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.590" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">instead Society has decided that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:03:58.950" style="s2">going to prop you would also be a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:01.230" style="s2">NBA player so you&#39;re gonna be in an end</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be an NBA star the chances</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.230" end="00:04:06.300" style="s2">of that person be the best in both of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:08.550" style="s2">those is very small but if we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.300" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">them in the NBA instead of saving</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.550" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">people&#39;s lives in brain surgery that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work if people are choosing</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:16.020" style="s2">where they&#39;re going based on the market</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">instead of where is your competency the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.020" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">highest where do you like doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:21.180" style="s2">do you want to be a brain surgeon or do</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">you want to play basketball whichever</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">one you want to do is probably the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:26.190" style="s2">that you should be focusing on not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">Society deciding which one is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.190" end="00:04:31.170" style="s2">and they might choose the NBA in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:33.060" style="s2">case but if the NBA pays better and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.170" end="00:04:36.540" style="s2">does they&#39;re gonna choose that one and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.060" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t create the best outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.540" end="00:04:41.760" style="s2">just because we reward those with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.860" style="s2">highest competency in fact the more</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.760" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">people we have plane that the higher</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.860" end="00:04:47.970" style="s2">that bar is gonna be so like I said the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">three doesn&#39;t even make it on the radar</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.970" end="00:04:51.090" style="s2">the three out of the ten doesn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:53.490" style="s2">on the radar and the thousand out of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.090" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">million and so the more we can get</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.490" end="00:04:57.060" style="s2">everybody&#39;s needs nets across the board</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">the more people we have plane and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.060" end="00:05:03.930" style="s2">therefore the better the outcome the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:05.460" style="s2">more innovation there is in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.930" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">that we have to acknowledge a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.460" end="00:05:11.340" style="s2">that being the most competent mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:14.370" style="s2">comes from luck lack of genetics lack of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">circumstance luck of what what forces</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.370" end="00:05:21.090" style="s2">the market happens to be rewarding at</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">that time period and so just like we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.090" end="00:05:24.150" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t look at somebody who did ten</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:26.250" style="s2">tails in a row as being a better human</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.150" end="00:05:27.810" style="s2">being just because you&#39;re the top brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.250" end="00:05:29.850" style="s2">surgeon doesn&#39;t make you a better human</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.810" end="00:05:32.460" style="s2">being us tearing you down and not</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.850" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">letting in practice brain surgery does</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.460" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">it make sense but neither just saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:41.820" style="s2">that you&#39;re the only one who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">practice you&#39;re the only one who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:45.720" style="s2">do it and only the top people from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">top rich families gets to go to school</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.720" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">and try to see if they could be a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">brain surgeon we&#39;re not getting our best</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">brain surgeons then and so the outcome</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:58.230" style="s2">of this he talks about later and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:01.260" style="s2">want to go too long but he that we that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.230" end="00:06:04.350" style="s2">people conflate power and competency and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.260" end="00:06:08.310" style="s2">authority he&#39;s conflating it competency</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.350" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">falls along this scale power correlates</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.310" end="00:06:11.970" style="s2">with that because that like you Joe</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">Rogan and the more 1.2 billion people he</p>
