<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:01.410" style="s2">own project in the last week last</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:03.300" style="s2">Saturday I wasn&#39;t at this because I held</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.410" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">the first fall in love with a fellow</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.300" end="00:05:07.860" style="s2">human being otherwise called oxytocin 36</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.600" style="s2">and only one person showed up for it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.860" end="00:05:10.740" style="s2">it was amazing that that one person</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.600" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">showed up and I got to know him better</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.740" end="00:05:14.970" style="s2">and it&#39;s on the back burner of something</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">that is in the toolbox or something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.970" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">can be used to to bond people but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:21.479" style="s2">don&#39;t quite know how to get people to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.010" style="s2">and I&#39;m not really willing to put in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.479" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">effort to figure that out at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.010" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">because my focus is on solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:28.380" style="s2">where we had ours this last week on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">slavery</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.550" end="00:05:37.800" style="s2">and just continuing with that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:39.539" style="s2">figuring out how can I get more people</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">to host solution raisings and now that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.539" end="00:05:42.419" style="s2">have a zoom account how can I hosting</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:44.789" style="s2">them on there and getting people to show</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.419" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">up consistently so we can break out into</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.789" end="00:05:48.810" style="s2">groups and at least have parallel ones</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:50.220" style="s2">processor 18 is continuing on we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.810" end="00:05:52.889" style="s2">still meeting going through the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.220" end="00:05:54.990" style="s2">foundational documents we&#39;ve moved on</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.889" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">from vision admission to the currencies</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.990" end="00:06:01.080" style="s2">and that is an interesting process I am</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:04.229" style="s2">enjoying otherwise just try not to start</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.080" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">any new fires the ones that I currently</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.229" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">have and I&#39;m thinking what I need in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:11.610" style="s2">next couple weeks is to do a project</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">raising on solution raising to figure</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.610" end="00:06:15.630" style="s2">out how do I get those extra people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.430" style="s2">still in the process of getting my</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.630" end="00:06:19.139" style="s2">document to the stage that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.430" end="00:06:21.419" style="s2">send it to carry which might just be</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.139" end="00:06:23.699" style="s2">sending it to carry as is because I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.419" end="00:06:25.860" style="s2">can&#39;t necessarily it&#39;s like here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.699" end="00:06:27.810" style="s2">brain dump and then trying to organize</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">it into a way that makes sense so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.810" end="00:06:35.270" style="s2">it flows is not my strong point so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:35.270" style="s2">is what I&#39;m up to or have been up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:44.349" style="s2">so I guess that means we kind of see if</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.029" end="00:06:44.349" style="s2">anyone wants to be in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.559" end="00:06:52.490" style="s2">Adriel on yours I know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.789" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">data like that in the US I&#39;m not aware</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.490" end="00:07:00.199" style="s2">of any for downloadable but it should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">there yeah that&#39;s what I&#39;ll end up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.199" end="00:07:03.889" style="s2">probably just going to go from sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:06.229" style="s2">you know where&#39;s the east checking each</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.889" end="00:07:07.819" style="s2">province in Canada and then if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.229" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">see anything there I&#39;ll check you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.819" end="00:07:13.189" style="s2">state-by-state starting with the larger</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:15.259" style="s2">states it&#39;s sort of the more because</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.189" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">yeah they&#39;re like the more digitally</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.259" end="00:07:18.469" style="s2">savvy ones because some of them aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:21.949" style="s2">very savvy and some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.469" end="00:07:25.490" style="s2">extremely so it&#39;s I&#39;m actually yeah kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.949" end="00:07:27.379" style="s2">of more used to that data anyway but and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.490" end="00:07:29.629" style="s2">you might include in your searches like</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.379" end="00:07:31.789" style="s2">open data that&#39;s a term that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.629" end="00:07:33.439" style="s2">used for people that especially want it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.789" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">to be able to be dealt downloadable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.439" end="00:07:36.469" style="s2">a lot more politically that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:37.999" style="s2">point yeah there&#39;s probably some some</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.469" end="00:07:41.059" style="s2">services outside that have already done</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.999" end="00:07:44.149" style="s2">that and no because if you look like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.059" end="00:07:45.979" style="s2">looked at BC and Alberta so far and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.149" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">do seem to follow a format it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.979" end="00:07:50.539" style="s2">easy for me to use but it&#39;s you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:52.129" style="s2">gonna be fairly easy for somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.539" end="00:07:54.680" style="s2">write a program that could go through</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.129" end="00:07:58.279" style="s2">and parse it and then add it to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.680" end="00:08:01.459" style="s2">data so if someone&#39;s done that then that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.279" end="00:08:03.709" style="s2">might make it easier yeah and if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.459" end="00:08:08.620" style="s2">need help parsing the data I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.709" end="00:08:12.979" style="s2">lot of that in the past thank you</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.620" end="00:08:14.779" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s kind of the current plan</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.979" end="00:08:17.659" style="s2">if for whatever reason I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.779" end="00:08:19.009" style="s2">and then the fallback was to instead of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.659" end="00:08:22.069" style="s2">doing the politicians and their voting</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.009" end="00:08:23.959" style="s2">history because the framework as it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.069" end="00:08:25.639" style="s2">just tracks people organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.959" end="00:08:27.979" style="s2">then the people&#39;s positions in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.639" end="00:08:31.550" style="s2">organization&#39;s the other option is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.979" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">start tracking sort of events in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:36.199" style="s2">news and tying it back to organizations</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:37.699" style="s2">and people mostly around sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.199" end="00:08:40.370" style="s2">individual companies are handling all</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.699" end="00:08:41.719" style="s2">kovat thing like the companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.370" end="00:08:43.180" style="s2">actually doing cool stuff the companies</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.719" end="00:08:44.990" style="s2">they&#39;re very much not doing cool stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.180" end="00:08:46.939" style="s2">the companies that are just going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.990" end="00:08:48.380" style="s2">staying on the sidelines and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.939" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">trying to make it as much money as</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.380" end="00:08:54.339" style="s2">possible no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:55.899" style="s2">just to have that record but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.339" end="00:08:58.920" style="s2">lot more involved there it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.899" end="00:09:01.389" style="s2">it&#39;ll be easier just to add things for</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.920" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">the legislation and voting history and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.389" end="00:09:05.170" style="s2">then there&#39;s a way to you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:11.560" style="s2">have that not easier to understand data</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.170" end="00:09:13.329" style="s2">format and I&#39;m off with the races no I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.560" end="00:09:15.670" style="s2">remember when we cuz when we first like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.329" end="00:09:17.649" style="s2">years ago talk about crazy and items DVD</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.670" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">for politicians there was something that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.649" end="00:09:23.709" style="s2">was looking up what your politician like</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:26.139" style="s2">what your MP voted for how they voted on</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.709" end="00:09:29.500" style="s2">different issues historically but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.139" end="00:09:32.199" style="s2">was uh nearly a decade this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.500" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">default format of how the bc system</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.199" end="00:09:36.339" style="s2">works if you go there it&#39;s just a giant</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:38.589" style="s2">list of like a it list per person and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.339" end="00:09:43.180" style="s2">then it lists like all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.589" end="00:09:45.459" style="s2">did they voted on and how they voted but</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.180" end="00:09:47.110" style="s2">the end goal like i mean theoretically</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.459" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">that could work if i just wanted to pull</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.110" end="00:09:53.769" style="s2">out like five people and five pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:55.180" style="s2">legislation but if i can swing it the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.769" end="00:09:57.189" style="s2">end goal is to actually be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.180" end="00:09:59.439" style="s2">like you know here&#39;s a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.189" end="00:10:01.899" style="s2">politicians in DC here&#39;s 20 pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.439" end="00:10:04.120" style="s2">legislation here&#39;s the full voting</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.899" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">history is after that the immediate next</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.120" end="00:10:08.470" style="s2">step is to start to categorize the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:11.529" style="s2">legislation and then use that to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.470" end="00:10:14.709" style="s2">create a summary of like hey on these 20</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.529" end="00:10:16.509" style="s2">pieces of environmental legislation you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.709" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">know did this person either you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.509" end="00:10:21.100" style="s2">voted like 95% of the time for it or you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:24.759" style="s2">know eighty-three percent of time</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.100" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">against it so you can start to test you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.759" end="00:10:28.660" style="s2">there but yeah that&#39;s a good point both</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.860" end="00:10:31.149" style="s2">sort of your and Bentleys is look for</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.660" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">other services that may have already</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.149" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">done this work and that may have parsed</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:39.149" style="s2">the different provinces and states into</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:39.149" style="s2">something a bit more understandable</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.350" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">Thank You sounds like it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.650" end="00:10:51.370" style="s2">that is going to be even less you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">create a bot that does it a lot of data</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.370" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">entry right a lot of like this just</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:57.640" style="s2">personally voted on all these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.300" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">which is enough for just bc let alone</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.640" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">all of the provinces and canada and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:03.730" style="s2">of course in the states to do all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:06.100" style="s2">that that is the point where you like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.730" end="00:11:09.010" style="s2">want volunteers you want people that can</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:11.170" style="s2">but not in it has to be at that stage my</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.010" end="00:11:13.240" style="s2">guess is you can find them fairly easily</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.170" end="00:11:16.150" style="s2">just on facebook of like hey who wants</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.240" end="00:11:17.980" style="s2">to change your political stance you know</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.980" end="00:11:24.970" style="s2">data entry i would donate i said that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.050" end="00:11:27.730" style="s2">let me try to look at the individual oh</p>

<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:13:00.940" style="s2">five topics but they kind of do roughly</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.570" end="00:13:03.310" style="s2">the same thing that I find for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.940" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">collection where it shows like how this</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.310" end="00:13:07.390" style="s2">person voted on gear right so it shows</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:33.640" style="s2">probably fairly good okay legal document</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.840" end="00:13:35.620" style="s2">they voted for against it no they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.640" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">they don&#39;t trust cuz that there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.250" end="00:15:32.740" style="s2">confident in this is like that this is</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">is maybe the first that she&#39;s sort of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.370" end="00:15:47.080" style="s2">it might not be that that commonality it</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:49.210" style="s2">might not be out there that much which</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.080" end="00:15:52.150" style="s2">is half the problem really is it does</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.210" end="00:15:54.610" style="s2">seem to be like there&#39;s things on here</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.150" end="00:15:56.950" style="s2">where that&#39;s sort of how I want to show</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.950" end="00:16:02.490" style="s2">somebody would even argue against like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.020" end="00:16:04.900" style="s2">this person it&#39;s showing it like</p>

<p begin="00:16:11.410" end="00:16:16.300" style="s2">absences but something like you know</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.130" end="00:16:29.080" style="s2">voted I&#39;m gonna be people who are angry</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.610" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">about that and that&#39;s sort of how the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.080" end="00:16:33.370" style="s2">easiest way to start are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:34.780" style="s2">both sides will water sort of agree with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.370" end="00:16:39.520" style="s2">what actually happened because that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.780" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">supports their that their worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.520" end="00:16:52.780" style="s2">sort of how they position themselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:57.010" style="s2">oh you&#39;ve also got a sight of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.780" end="00:16:58.990" style="s2">their attendance records and then as I</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:15.990" style="s2">the end I don&#39;t care they&#39;re absent</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.079" end="00:17:17.880" style="s2">or they&#39;re sleeping I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.990" end="00:17:20.370" style="s2">track the percentage of votes that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.880" end="00:17:21.809" style="s2">were absent for because if you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.370" end="00:17:24.899" style="s2">for someone and they were absent you</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.809" end="00:17:27.419" style="s2">know 87 percent of the time and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.899" end="00:17:29.460" style="s2">else is you know absences are like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.419" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">know less than 50% you&#39;re like oh this</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.460" end="00:17:32.760" style="s2">person is lazy they don&#39;t want to show</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.519" end="00:18:09.720" style="s2">up until last night I was planning on</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.620" end="00:18:11.669" style="s2">doing the the organizational one then I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.720" end="00:18:14.100" style="s2">was like it&#39;s gonna be better just to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.669" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">the politics first it&#39;ll be yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.100" end="00:18:17.970" style="s2">more open and yeah I mean somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.909" style="s2">here I&#39;m having trouble finding it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.970" end="00:18:22.350" style="s2">there&#39;s so much data it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.909" end="00:18:24.360" style="s2">surprising because they do have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.350" end="00:18:26.399" style="s2">all the spending data for the Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.360" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">federal government and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.399" end="00:18:30.299" style="s2">link on I think the front page of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:33.210" style="s2">that that has like the open government</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.299" end="00:18:36.539" style="s2">websites for the for the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.210" end="00:18:39.539" style="s2">jurisdictions or at least the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.539" end="00:18:41.580" style="s2">exist so I guess it would just be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.539" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">matter of fishing through all this</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.580" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">funding right yeah this the ballotpedia</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:50.190" style="s2">one you sent over which I should have</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:51.809" style="s2">actually started there but Bella PD is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.190" end="00:18:54.539" style="s2">pretty good resource yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.809" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">did they have are they just us-based or</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.539" end="00:19:02.100" style="s2">the I believe so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:04.289" style="s2">hey that up Matus do you want to give</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.100" end="00:19:10.620" style="s2">your update what you&#39;re working on I</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.289" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">could use up with I yesterday realized</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.620" end="00:19:15.480" style="s2">what I was missing</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:18.299" style="s2">though I wasn&#39;t aware of it so I&#39;m busy</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.480" end="00:19:21.029" style="s2">I didn&#39;t protect and once this audit I</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.299" end="00:19:22.500" style="s2">will find another thing that was missing</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.029" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">and others as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.500" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.740" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">no public at least yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.530" end="00:19:55.790" style="s2">I think we&#39;re all searching okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:58.390" style="s2">probably enough for that I can dig</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.790" end="00:20:02.690" style="s2">through the multitude of resources that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.390" end="00:20:04.790" style="s2">we talked about so far and that was more</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.690" end="00:20:06.530" style="s2">just cuz people weren&#39;t you know no</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.790" end="00:20:07.580" style="s2">nobody was jumping into the hot seat so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.530" end="00:20:09.080" style="s2">I figured that it was something that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.580" end="00:20:12.380" style="s2">was going to be doing research on so why</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.080" end="00:20:13.400" style="s2">not start with a brainstorm yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.380" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">good I&#39;m actually gonna do a quick</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.400" end="00:20:18.410" style="s2">search for open data in the background</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:21.320" style="s2">just so that it&#39;s America I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:24.200" style="s2">anyone who has a democratic democracy</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.320" end="00:20:26.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a democratic government is more</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.200" end="00:20:28.490" style="s2">like they kind of have to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.540" end="00:20:31.010" style="s2">with who voted for what it&#39;s on camera</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.490" end="00:20:33.290" style="s2">it&#39;s on it&#39;s just how usable is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.010" end="00:20:36.010" style="s2">information exactly yeah with all this</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.290" end="00:20:38.990" style="s2">like all like the thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.010" end="00:20:40.430" style="s2">Bentley sent over I knew about about PD</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.990" end="00:20:42.680" style="s2">and there&#39;s great information here but</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.430" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not really like easily parsed into</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.680" end="00:20:46.340" style="s2">that like I can probably dig deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:48.920" style="s2">see if there&#39;s an underlying information</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.340" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">source I mean it&#39;s very cool because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.920" end="00:20:54.560" style="s2">shows like you know where they get their</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:56.810" style="s2">money from how they voted on the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.560" end="00:20:58.280" style="s2">previous page you had that I was on you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.810" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">could actually sort it by their</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.280" end="00:21:03.560" style="s2">percentage of absences and and like it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.650" style="s2">seemed like the average was like 1% and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.560" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">there&#39;s people who have like 20% absence</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.650" end="00:21:18.500" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:20.900" style="s2">yeah and for for the u.s. every vote</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.500" end="00:21:23.420" style="s2">should be recorded but of course now</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.900" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">that would be by Bill ID and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.420" end="00:21:29.090" style="s2">that so the the stuff that ballotpedia</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:31.730" style="s2">is done taking a step further and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.090" end="00:21:36.200" style="s2">this is for this or against this that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.730" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">would be in the data in the source data</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.200" end="00:21:41.510" style="s2">and also that can be tricky because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:44.270" style="s2">know sometimes as you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.510" end="00:21:45.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a bill for like a road but</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.270" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a writer on there that would do</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.680" end="00:21:49.160" style="s2">something else and they voted against it</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:50.660" style="s2">for that I mean it&#39;d be nice if in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.160" end="00:21:54.020" style="s2">future and I think we discussed this if</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:56.510" style="s2">the politicians could say why they chose</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.020" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">to vote the way they did yes I thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.510" end="00:22:02.340" style="s2">choirs their participation</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.700" end="00:22:04.890" style="s2">yeah and they&#39;re like that part I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.340" end="00:22:07.530" style="s2">necessarily need in the data because</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.890" end="00:22:11.010" style="s2">that&#39;s something unique that collection</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.530" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">will take in its own direction and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.010" end="00:22:14.730" style="s2">stuff is how Belle pedia works is sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.990" end="00:22:16.710" style="s2">of they have their own data but it might</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.730" end="00:22:18.809" style="s2">be okay for just like the prototype to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.710" end="00:22:22.860" style="s2">show like here&#39;s an example of how it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.809" end="00:22:26.429" style="s2">might look the part of it is to just go</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.860" end="00:22:27.690" style="s2">like the puppet is great but candidly I</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.429" end="00:22:29.940" style="s2">don&#39;t think most people are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.690" end="00:22:31.400" style="s2">look at that level of information like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.940" end="00:22:34.770" style="s2">it should be kind of a snapshot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.400" end="00:22:36.480" style="s2">here&#39;s you know a 60 second read on what</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.770" end="00:22:40.350" style="s2">this person did and how they performed</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.480" end="00:22:43.350" style="s2">and if you want to drill in you can yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.350" end="00:22:44.909" style="s2">you know as you cheaply said this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.350" end="00:22:48.990" style="s2">information is actually very available</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.909" end="00:22:50.280" style="s2">in most areas that are democratic I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.990" end="00:22:52.500" style="s2">think there&#39;s some that still sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.280" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">hide it there&#39;s some that they do like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.500" end="00:22:57.450" style="s2">voice vote where you can&#39;t really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:59.909" style="s2">not the the same or I think at that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.450" end="00:23:03.659" style="s2">point all that you can really say is</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.909" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">like person was present and here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.659" end="00:23:08.070" style="s2">the vault went right like they say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:10.350" style="s2">the yeas want it but even that is in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.070" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">exact because there have been you know a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.350" end="00:23:14.970" style="s2">few the videos came complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:16.980" style="s2">the voice vote system or it shows a</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.970" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">recording and you hear that one side</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.980" end="00:23:24.900" style="s2">clearly has it just from the volume but</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:27.600" style="s2">they give it to the other side part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.900" end="00:23:30.299" style="s2">those places that does that we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.600" end="00:23:32.580" style="s2">that anybody we don&#39;t think so the one</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.299" end="00:23:36.679" style="s2">that comes to mind was the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.580" end="00:23:39.480" style="s2">convention in 2016 where yeah there was</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.679" end="00:23:47.880" style="s2">close to some riots if you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.480" end="00:23:54.830" style="s2">videos people were not happy just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.880" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">record of the votes and yes we do but</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.830" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t have it and one day of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:04.520" style="s2">11th September last year</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.539" end="00:24:13.840" style="s2">they had I mean Department at 88 votes</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.860" end="00:24:17.680" style="s2">and the first one was about when to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.840" end="00:24:22.300" style="s2">announce a break yeah so I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.680" end="00:24:25.090" style="s2">now if they voted so many times every</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.300" end="00:24:28.120" style="s2">day the amount of data they evolved its</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.090" end="00:24:33.370" style="s2">own and they see the lease is so</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.120" end="00:24:41.860" style="s2">detailed and so I mean they voted on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.370" end="00:24:43.720" style="s2">such irrelevant pieces so I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.860" end="00:24:45.670" style="s2">to see how that works cuz I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.720" end="00:24:47.560" style="s2">think like sometimes days in government</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.670" end="00:24:50.070" style="s2">can get very long so if that was an</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.560" end="00:24:55.140" style="s2">11-hour day at 8 miles an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.070" end="00:24:58.300" style="s2">like that&#39;s a vote every what 7 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.140" end="00:25:00.850" style="s2">I would like to see like half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.300" end="00:25:02.560" style="s2">video of that day just to see how oh I</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.850" end="00:25:07.710" style="s2">guess I couldn&#39;t understand it but just</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.560" end="00:25:07.710" style="s2">to see how quickly that went that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.910" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">474 actually yeah it&#39;s probably some I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.930" end="00:25:19.930" style="s2">mean this is the issue in any time you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:21.250" style="s2">have meetings where you need to vote on</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.930" end="00:25:23.350" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s like let&#39;s vote on when</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.250" end="00:25:25.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a break can we not have the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.350" end="00:25:26.890" style="s2">thing every day</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.180" end="00:25:29.560" style="s2">point of privilege point of privilege</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.890" end="00:25:33.000" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna bring up all of my issues it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.560" end="00:25:35.670" style="s2">just like lasts a very long time oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.000" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">they&#39;ll be talking about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.670" end="00:25:42.910" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen like hours something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:48.220" style="s2">that they just voted on every single</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.910" end="00:25:52.420" style="s2">thing and there&#39;s so much to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.220" end="00:25:57.310" style="s2">yeah clearly they don&#39;t have any data</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.420" end="00:25:59.920" style="s2">scientist or any mighty person no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.310" end="00:26:02.860" style="s2">very normal for the government site</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.920" end="00:26:05.140" style="s2">itself is almost never that readable it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.860" end="00:26:07.960" style="s2">usually takes a different group but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.140" end="00:26:14.020" style="s2">think the last link that Bentley sent</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.960" end="00:26:18.340" style="s2">may have just oh it&#39;s Crito license but</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.020" end="00:26:21.010" style="s2">um yeah the Guv tracked us I went to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.340" end="00:26:22.180" style="s2">like the HR to invest in America and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.010" end="00:26:24.070" style="s2">it&#39;s actually got pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.180" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">information this guy got it break down</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.070" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">by party and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.710" style="s2">download a CSV of how people voted for</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">just that piece of legislation which</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.710" end="00:26:33.040" style="s2">means that I can just go download that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">for 20 pieces of legislation and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.040" end="00:26:37.390" style="s2">should give me what I need</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:41.410" style="s2">yeah yeah and it looks like they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.390" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">their data from there using some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.410" end="00:26:45.700" style="s2">software to read the data from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:48.820" style="s2">congressional votes in the u.s. directly</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.700" end="00:26:52.059" style="s2">from the Senate and the Congress nice</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.820" end="00:26:54.880" style="s2">sites that are XML in case anyone wants</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.059" end="00:26:57.250" style="s2">the raw data but yeah I&#39;ll pass on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.880" end="00:27:00.760" style="s2">that&#39;s probably uh I guess it would end</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.250" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">up being that might end up being the raw</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.760" end="00:27:08.380" style="s2">data that&#39;s actually even better but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:10.900" style="s2">think for my purposes look I know in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.380" end="00:27:12.669" style="s2">States that people normally do vote on</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.900" end="00:27:13.780" style="s2">party lines right you&#39;re gonna know</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.669" end="00:27:16.030" style="s2">whether the Republicans or Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.780" end="00:27:18.250" style="s2">vote but they don&#39;t it&#39;s not as strict</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.030" end="00:27:20.650" style="s2">as in Canada I would be very interested</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.250" end="00:27:23.500" style="s2">as to when any MP voted against their</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.650" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">party because it&#39;s so rare that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.500" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">like wait are you representing me are</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.830" style="s2">you representing the Liberals which one</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">are you representing because you should</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.830" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">vote differently and so when an MP does</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:36.220" style="s2">vote differently that is actually much</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.900" style="s2">more interesting than it would be you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.220" end="00:27:40.809" style="s2">know in the states where it&#39;s not it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:42.370" style="s2">absolutely yeah I think there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.809" end="00:27:45.730" style="s2">different things that you&#39;d want on</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.370" end="00:27:47.890" style="s2">surface but a big part of this is just</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.730" end="00:27:50.260" style="s2">to get the data and once you have it you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.890" end="00:27:52.360" style="s2">can do so much with it like in the US</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.260" end="00:27:55.750" style="s2">especially I would want to tie how</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.360" end="00:27:57.669" style="s2">somebody voted to where there the money</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.750" end="00:27:59.980" style="s2">from their campaign came from and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.669" end="00:28:01.809" style="s2">to see like hey how did other people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.980" end="00:28:04.030" style="s2">their party vote or or that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.809" end="00:28:05.770" style="s2">people who didn&#39;t get get money and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.030" end="00:28:07.650" style="s2">versus how did somebody on the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.770" end="00:28:11.140" style="s2">party vote who did get money from the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.650" end="00:28:13.419" style="s2">same group too tight there because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.140" end="00:28:16.510" style="s2">the whole citizens united you know just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.419" end="00:28:18.970" style="s2">openly being bribed it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.510" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2">interesting to see how that affects it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.970" end="00:28:23.049" style="s2">and in Canada yeah I have the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:24.520" style="s2">thing of like is it&#39;s very much you you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.049" end="00:28:27.580" style="s2">you can get in a lot of trouble for</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.520" end="00:28:30.190" style="s2">voting against your party once yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.580" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">some case you can get kicked out and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.190" end="00:28:34.150" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m very interested to see like</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:38.110" style="s2">health and that happens and who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.150" end="00:28:39.220" style="s2">it and then also becomes not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.110" end="00:28:41.290" style="s2">tracking how</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.220" end="00:28:43.450" style="s2">the individual votes but how the party</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:45.670" style="s2">votes because in Canada if you&#39;re voting</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.450" end="00:28:48.670" style="s2">for a person you&#39;re generally actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.670" end="00:28:50.410" style="s2">voting for the party and that all party</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.670" end="00:28:51.970" style="s2">platforms even if you liked your local</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.410" end="00:28:53.890" style="s2">person but don&#39;t like the person in</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.970" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">charge of their party probably shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.890" end="00:28:57.430" style="s2">vote for that person then is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:29:05.740" style="s2">technically you know voting for whoever</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.430" end="00:29:07.930" style="s2">is leading that party cool yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.740" end="00:29:10.380" style="s2">I should be able to take this like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.930" end="00:29:15.160" style="s2">and they sent over and get some data</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.380" end="00:29:16.600" style="s2">ready to populate so it&#39;s a people and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.160" end="00:29:24.700" style="s2">have to decide how this will fit in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.600" end="00:29:28.120" style="s2">whole person organizations dataset but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.700" end="00:29:29.500" style="s2">think that is uh that&#39;s good I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.120" end="00:29:31.960" style="s2">planning on jumping right to the US</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.500" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">Congress and Senate but but if the data</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.960" end="00:29:40.450" style="s2">is that available and easy to understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:42.670" style="s2">then all right yeah I&#39;m just excited for</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.450" end="00:29:45.150" style="s2">anyone to get the data in order so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.670" end="00:29:47.800" style="s2">can actually use it in which case then</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.150" end="00:29:50.680" style="s2">if there&#39;s a lot that can&#39;t be done when</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.800" end="00:29:54.130" style="s2">he when humanity has access to data that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.680" end="00:29:59.190" style="s2">they can understand and use it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.130" end="00:30:01.930" style="s2">90% how we great game B Oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.190" end="00:30:07.090" style="s2">information we trust and can use what do</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.930" end="00:30:11.280" style="s2">you know that once it&#39;s all the data</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.090" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">about government politicians and money</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.280" end="00:30:18.670" style="s2">and how many moves across businesses and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:19.420" style="s2">families of politicians while that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.670" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.420" end="00:30:23.830" style="s2">it means they Mary is going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:26.710" style="s2">very shaken maybe not for the part</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.830" end="00:30:30.460" style="s2">straight away but still so many things</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.710" end="00:30:32.800" style="s2">that&#39;s important came up about the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.460" end="00:30:36.670" style="s2">pandemics and so who bought what</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.800" end="00:30:41.050" style="s2">equipment and why and which family of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.670" end="00:30:45.340" style="s2">which politician that&#39;s like tons of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.050" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">money that was very interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.340" end="00:30:51.610" style="s2">is given how much we know what happened</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.200" end="00:30:54.580" style="s2">and who earned</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.610" end="00:31:00.730" style="s2">lots of money the question is how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.580" end="00:31:02.350" style="s2">we don&#39;t know you know yeah and I my</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.730" end="00:31:04.390" style="s2">only goal for all this is to take thee</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.350" end="00:31:05.830" style="s2">because it&#39;ll change per country sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.390" end="00:31:08.110" style="s2">what you&#39;re really wanting to look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.830" end="00:31:10.630" style="s2">like in Canada it&#39;s very party base I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.110" end="00:31:12.310" style="s2">think in a lot of you know places that</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.630" end="00:31:14.800" style="s2">run on these in system it&#39;ll be the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.310" end="00:31:16.590" style="s2">in the u.s. because you can vote outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.800" end="00:31:19.930" style="s2">party lines without a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.590" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">repercussions most the time but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.930" end="00:31:24.400" style="s2">know of any other country that has</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:27.610" style="s2">something is you know blatantly open</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.400" end="00:31:29.920" style="s2">bribery as citizens united that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.610" end="00:31:33.030" style="s2">becomes a very different like still very</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.920" end="00:31:35.620" style="s2">you know interesting information to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.030" end="00:31:37.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s one of the things like where</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.620" end="00:31:39.220" style="s2">what Kerry said with the like well</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.300" end="00:31:41.230" style="s2">people they might not trust the site</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.220" end="00:31:44.710" style="s2">that she said because it&#39;s even though</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:46.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not done by the government because</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.710" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of specific to the UK and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.810" end="00:31:51.970" style="s2">a charity well we saw in the last</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:53.680" style="s2">Canadian government that charities can</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.970" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">be swayed by the government by being</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.680" end="00:31:56.470" style="s2">like oh if you don&#39;t you know do this</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:31:58.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna take away your charity</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.470" end="00:32:00.940" style="s2">status but if you&#39;re an international</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.360" end="00:32:02.830" style="s2">thing like if we&#39;re not in the US and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.940" end="00:32:07.420" style="s2">I&#39;m reporting on us stuff they haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.830" end="00:32:08.980" style="s2">have zero sway and it&#39;s doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.420" end="00:32:14.620" style="s2">countries with the same system that sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.980" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">of you know as we were talking enough I</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.620" end="00:32:18.760" style="s2">lost a bit more of what I said yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:21.040" style="s2">there&#39;s an article about it not being</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.760" end="00:32:23.380" style="s2">that infallible you know but there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.040" end="00:32:26.800" style="s2">also an something like a fella crossed</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.380" end="00:32:29.110" style="s2">years ago and it was a way the political</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.800" end="00:32:31.810" style="s2">parties get the funding from and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.110" end="00:32:34.090" style="s2">got that in most countries as well but</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.810" end="00:32:36.310" style="s2">also what I&#39;d like to see is all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.090" end="00:32:39.160" style="s2">lobby groups so you&#39;ve got all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.310" end="00:32:41.920" style="s2">lobby groups that nobody knows about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.160" end="00:32:43.450" style="s2">sort of like in their making all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.920" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">decisions for each and every government</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.450" end="00:32:48.040" style="s2">so it&#39;d be interesting to find out who</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:50.290" style="s2">blew these lobby groups are as well and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.040" end="00:32:52.420" style="s2">and what they&#39;re doing and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.290" end="00:32:54.430" style="s2">up to I think that would be also</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.420" end="00:32:56.170" style="s2">interesting as well because as I said</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.430" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re probably twisting the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.170" end="00:33:00.040" style="s2">arms you know I mean depending on how</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:02.590" style="s2">much depth you&#39;ve got on them all get</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.040" end="00:33:05.470" style="s2">off so him yeah so that&#39;d be quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.590" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">interested yeah especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.470" end="00:33:09.549" style="s2">because when I talk about Citizens</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:11.590" style="s2">United that&#39;s sort of one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.549" end="00:33:13.809" style="s2">that that came out of that is just the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.590" end="00:33:16.750" style="s2">blatant like them giving money to</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.809" end="00:33:18.039" style="s2">politicians and then you can see will</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.750" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">born there in power like oh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.039" end="00:33:21.490" style="s2">obviously not voting for the people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:23.440" style="s2">interest who are they voting for oh the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.490" end="00:33:25.539" style="s2">people who put them in power even though</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.440" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">you&#39;d think that was the voting public</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.539" end="00:33:28.780" style="s2">but they actually give credit to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:30.280" style="s2">people that gave them money for their</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.780" end="00:33:33.070" style="s2">campaigns as to who put them in power</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.280" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">and that ends up being I mean and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.070" end="00:33:37.750" style="s2">true in Canada as well although it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:39.970" style="s2">quite at the same level as in the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.750" end="00:33:43.299" style="s2">from what I can tell but yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.970" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">super important part though uh that is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.299" end="00:33:47.380" style="s2">more complex layer so that&#39;s on still</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:49.770" style="s2">probably the fairly short term roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.380" end="00:33:52.230" style="s2">because that&#39;s super interesting to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.770" end="00:33:54.690" style="s2">but it does get a bit harder to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.230" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">parse that information and put it in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.690" end="00:33:59.940" style="s2">irritable way but yeah that&#39;s what one</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:02.169" style="s2">of the things I want to know is not just</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.940" end="00:34:03.850" style="s2">who gave them money but then you track</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.169" end="00:34:05.830" style="s2">it back to the industry and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.850" end="00:34:07.480" style="s2">individual companies and then compare</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.830" end="00:34:09.099" style="s2">that to their voting history and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.480" end="00:34:10.629" style="s2">that they did while in office to see if</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.099" end="00:34:13.800" style="s2">you can tie those two together like if</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.629" end="00:34:16.330" style="s2">somebody is thoroughly funded by the NRA</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.800" end="00:34:19.060" style="s2">then check to see how you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.330" end="00:34:20.730" style="s2">they vote on gun legislation probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.060" end="00:34:23.369" style="s2">fairly one-sided if they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.730" end="00:34:25.990" style="s2">heavily right and then if somebody was</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.369" end="00:34:29.080" style="s2">you know heavily sponsored by tech how</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.990" end="00:34:36.849" style="s2">do they vote on tech stuff I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.080" end="00:34:39.849" style="s2">that&#39;s revealed yeah I like to think of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.849" end="00:34:41.889" style="s2">it as big data on Big Brother right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.849" end="00:34:44.909" style="s2">they have a bunch of information on us</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.889" end="00:34:47.710" style="s2">and we technically have access to</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.909" end="00:34:50.619" style="s2">information on them but like it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.710" end="00:34:52.810" style="s2">unusable for the average person like you</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.619" end="00:34:55.629" style="s2">would need to do hours of research to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.810" end="00:34:56.770" style="s2">figure out what your politician is doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.629" end="00:34:58.660" style="s2">and people just don&#39;t do that people</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.770" end="00:35:02.710" style="s2">don&#39;t a lot of people don&#39;t do five</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.660" end="00:35:04.210" style="s2">minutes of research a lot of it because</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.710" end="00:35:05.109" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how to get it and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.210" end="00:35:06.940" style="s2">of us probably because they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.109" end="00:35:08.859" style="s2">that they can really make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.940" end="00:35:11.740" style="s2">but if it&#39;s something that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.859" end="00:35:13.630" style="s2">you know open and public people people</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.740" end="00:35:15.910" style="s2">knew about it but then it was also</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.630" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">blatantly obvious why this wasn&#39;t under</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.910" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">the thumb of politics like you know we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:21.320" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.490" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">any government hunting it&#39;s all funded</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.320" end="00:35:25.130" style="s2">by members we don&#39;t have charity status</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">for the government to take away like</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.130" end="00:35:30.680" style="s2">every possible thing that the public</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:33.110" style="s2">says could be a concern for maybe why</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.680" end="00:35:34.490" style="s2">not to trust it you you you you tackle</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.110" end="00:35:36.800" style="s2">that and it becomes an important part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.490" end="00:35:38.690" style="s2">that brand to say here&#39;s all the things</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.800" end="00:35:42.020" style="s2">that we&#39;ve done to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:45.860" style="s2">can trust us I think one of the key ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.020" end="00:35:47.510" style="s2">is the crowdfunding is not taking money</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.860" end="00:35:50.090" style="s2">from anybody that&#39;s not just a voting</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.980" end="00:36:05.450" style="s2">contribute if he wants to but at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.200" end="00:36:11.660" style="s2">same limits as everyone else which will</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.450" end="00:36:13.880" style="s2">probably be you know maybe $100 talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.660" end="00:36:15.830" style="s2">about them like yeah you know cuz people</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.880" end="00:36:19.820" style="s2">were wondering why he was showing up all</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.850" end="00:36:33.820" style="s2">that was why you know I mean so among</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.090" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">many other things about say about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.820" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">yeah I guess you which I did this</p>

<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.290" style="s2">can see that sort of playing out even</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.220" end="00:36:44.600" style="s2">though it&#39;s not politics with Bill</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.290" end="00:36:46.430" style="s2">Gates&#39;s involvement in the vaccine thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.600" end="00:36:48.950" style="s2">we&#39;re now a bunch of people don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.430" end="00:36:51.490" style="s2">the whole vaccine conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.950" end="00:36:53.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of politicians and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.490" end="00:36:55.550" style="s2">billionaires trying to drive the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:36:58.840" style="s2">conversation when those are two groups</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.550" end="00:36:58.840" style="s2">that are in pretty low trust right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.100" end="00:37:03.770" style="s2">do you wonder if we the system was</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.630" end="00:37:05.480" style="s2">changed and you could as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.770" end="00:37:07.340" style="s2">philanthropist could give money to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.480" end="00:37:08.869" style="s2">something but you can&#39;t have any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.340" end="00:37:11.720" style="s2">like you can kind of only give it</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.869" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">anonymously you can you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.720" end="00:37:15.950" style="s2">be Bill Gates and be like hey I want a</p>

<p begin="00:37:15.950" end="00:37:19.400" style="s2">doing a free fun vaccine research that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.810" end="00:37:19.940" style="s2">takes a step back it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:22.850" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.940" end="00:37:24.410" style="s2">yeah yeah our entire system that he gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.850" end="00:37:26.030" style="s2">more of a say because he has billions of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.410" end="00:37:28.790" style="s2">dollars he has billions of dollars cuz</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.030" end="00:37:31.190" style="s2">he&#39;s acted in a very capitalist way</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.790" end="00:37:32.559" style="s2">where you know like Windows is the only</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.190" end="00:37:35.619" style="s2">thing that&#39;s allowed to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.559" end="00:37:37.059" style="s2">the pc computers yeah that what would</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.619" end="00:37:39.459" style="s2">what would actually change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.059" end="00:37:40.809" style="s2">yeah very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.459" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">they still want money if they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.809" end="00:37:45.640" style="s2">the power I don&#39;t know yes money&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:48.219" style="s2">anyway you know what what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.640" end="00:37:50.109" style="s2">find we need to find some legal legal</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.219" end="00:37:51.759" style="s2">brains because like as I said you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.109" end="00:37:53.589" style="s2">talking about philanthropy I was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.759" end="00:37:55.809" style="s2">listening to a podcast me to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.589" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">philanthropy and na and how it was set</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.809" end="00:38:01.269" style="s2">off for now they set up these charitable</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:03.039" style="s2">trusts everything come under what set in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.269" end="00:38:05.410" style="s2">the constitution of these charitable</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.039" end="00:38:08.019" style="s2">trusts enough but it&#39;s to stay that way</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.410" end="00:38:10.769" style="s2">infatuate you know i mean so people</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.019" end="00:38:13.469" style="s2">who&#39;d set set up trusts and things</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.769" end="00:38:16.420" style="s2">foundations were seen as big</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.469" end="00:38:18.099" style="s2">philanthropists overall for us records</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.420" end="00:38:20.499" style="s2">but nobody could touch it because of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.099" end="00:38:23.199" style="s2">way the legal legal system is set off</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.499" end="00:38:27.219" style="s2">for him so i think i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.199" end="00:38:29.289" style="s2">find so like legal brains and maybe want</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.219" end="00:38:30.549" style="s2">them to play out with us and that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.289" end="00:38:34.119" style="s2">then obviously there&#39;s loads of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.549" end="00:38:37.150" style="s2">loopholes everywhere you know I mean so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.119" end="00:38:38.890" style="s2">if you can find you know um with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.150" end="00:38:40.719" style="s2">place where to where the the chamber of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.890" end="00:38:42.219" style="s2">the bullet to George so wants to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.719" end="00:38:45.069" style="s2">back to where he&#39;ll be getting them</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.219" end="00:38:46.929" style="s2">other questions by that we hope to see</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.069" end="00:38:50.439" style="s2">if we can fight somebody in Scotland</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.929" end="00:38:53.949" style="s2">that I can maybe play out with so in you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.439" end="00:38:56.589" style="s2">might be interested and well maybe hunch</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.949" end="00:38:59.309" style="s2">is enough so maybe so I mean he&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.589" end="00:39:01.209" style="s2">laugh as well so yeah I really like them</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.309" end="00:39:02.799" style="s2">really be worth starting those</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.209" end="00:39:04.029" style="s2">conversations now because you know if</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.799" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">it&#39;s evolving the law is probably gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.029" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">take a while</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.130" end="00:39:13.150" style="s2">Scottish Lord is different from English</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.290" end="00:39:57.490" style="s2">just looking for something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.570" end="00:39:59.079" style="s2">to do to create you know all the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.490" end="00:40:01.119" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s going on because I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.079" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">they they probably get the laws and they</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.250" end="00:40:14.349" style="s2">on that in the future good for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.980" end="00:40:15.940" style="s2">people agree you know I mean so so if</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.349" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">you could find somebody in each country</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.940" end="00:40:22.089" style="s2">knows the law and just maybe sorta like</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:24.670" style="s2">set up a crew of legal eagles do we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.089" end="00:40:26.859" style="s2">got you know I mean so I&#39;ll be on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.670" end="00:40:28.839" style="s2">mission to collect the legal eagles you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.859" end="00:40:32.050" style="s2">know are we so that&#39;d be really cool</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.839" end="00:40:34.300" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s unlike the the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.050" end="00:40:36.430" style="s2">roadmap for wiki election just start</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.300" end="00:40:38.560" style="s2">building up a Council like one for</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.430" end="00:40:41.530" style="s2">lawyers and one for like people and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.560" end="00:40:44.020" style="s2">know in journalism in the media and for</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.530" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">people in cybersecurity to start sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.020" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">having groups that you can say like</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:50.109" style="s2">especially for something like the law</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:52.410" style="s2">where you would want to know overall</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.109" end="00:40:55.060" style="s2">because it needs to be sort of country</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.410" end="00:40:57.490" style="s2">agnostic and then for something like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.060" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">charity part of the goal is to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.490" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">what&#39;s the amount that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">spending on their cause because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:05.500" style="s2">big part of charities is like in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:07.930" style="s2">u.s. there&#39;s cancer charities that give</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.500" end="00:41:09.490" style="s2">like two percent of the money raised to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.930" end="00:41:12.040" style="s2">the cause and 98 percent of it goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.490" end="00:41:14.500" style="s2">towards administrative costs and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.040" end="00:41:15.940" style="s2">if people knew that the charity was</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.500" end="00:41:19.780" style="s2">doing it they probably wouldn&#39;t give to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.940" end="00:41:22.510" style="s2">that charity I just realized that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.780" end="00:41:25.960" style="s2">got loads of contact so value it in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.510" end="00:41:29.140" style="s2">security and cyber kind of security in</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.960" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">that and also and so they&#39;ll know other</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.140" end="00:41:35.380" style="s2">people so I just need to reactivate</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:37.780" style="s2">people contact so like you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.380" end="00:41:40.780" style="s2">so they&#39;ll probably be able to help me</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.780" end="00:41:42.970" style="s2">at some point so and but yes what&#39;s but</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.780" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">I see you can starts well as them the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.970" end="00:41:46.869" style="s2">collection phase has started that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:50.890" style="s2">be reaching around for people and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.869" end="00:41:52.270" style="s2">you know so and that&#39;s earlier the table</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.890" end="00:41:53.410" style="s2">but that was more just because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.270" end="00:41:54.790" style="s2">think I was going to run into somebody</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.410" end="00:41:57.810" style="s2">that had those contacts so if we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.790" end="00:41:57.810" style="s2">start it now hell yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:04.530" style="s2">I find this is not specifically for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.220" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">collection or politics but one of which</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:10.020" style="s2">is kovat 19 that is emerging as like</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:11.070" style="s2">scientists are not in agreement because</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.020" end="00:42:12.840" style="s2">it is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.070" end="00:42:14.670" style="s2">but looking at and I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.840" end="00:42:15.840" style="s2">a drill a to shore Bentley your projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.670" end="00:42:18.870" style="s2">whose would be better for it</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.840" end="00:42:20.790" style="s2">but to be able to look at the different</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.870" end="00:42:22.830" style="s2">countries their existing healthcare that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.790" end="00:42:24.990" style="s2">was in place long before what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.830" end="00:42:27.090" style="s2">politicians did and what their</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.990" end="00:42:29.070" style="s2">demographics was before because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.090" end="00:42:30.900" style="s2">pretty big important part did they like</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.070" end="00:42:35.490" style="s2">in Italy they have a lot of elderly</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.900" end="00:42:38.370" style="s2">people and then looking at what actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.490" end="00:42:39.810" style="s2">was the what was the impact could it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.370" end="00:42:41.610" style="s2">have been seen in advance right because</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.810" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">a lot of it is just luck well we we</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.610" end="00:42:45.420" style="s2">didn&#39;t do enough but we do how can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:48.030" style="s2">not get attacked yet right or we happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.420" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">to not get enough people and the other</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.030" end="00:42:53.910" style="s2">one that&#39;s very tied to that but not</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:56.310" style="s2">necessarily about the science is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.910" end="00:42:58.500" style="s2">funding of research like the Cancer</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.310" end="00:43:00.600" style="s2">Foundation and such and actually giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.500" end="00:43:03.330" style="s2">like the money going to the collection</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.600" end="00:43:05.730" style="s2">of people who are directly impacted by</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.330" end="00:43:07.260" style="s2">it to decide is this something we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.730" end="00:43:09.630" style="s2">to research right like even something</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.260" end="00:43:12.690" style="s2">like breast cancer you might choose to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.630" end="00:43:14.550" style="s2">put the money into treatments because</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:15.870" style="s2">you have it but you also might pass it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.550" end="00:43:18.420" style="s2">on to your kid and so you might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.870" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">wanting to put it into prevention it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.420" end="00:43:22.620" style="s2">seems that the actual Cancer Foundation</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">puts it into what&#39;s going to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.620" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">profitable right as opposed to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.020" style="s2">gonna actually get less breast cancer</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:28.980" style="s2">out there including the breast cancer</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.020" end="00:43:31.080" style="s2">industry itself like I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.980" end="00:43:33.030" style="s2">subconsciously they&#39;re like oh but what</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.080" end="00:43:34.620" style="s2">if we actually solve breast cancer there</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.030" end="00:43:38.070" style="s2">goes all of our jobs there goes all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.620" end="00:43:41.220" style="s2">our like to actually have the money that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.070" end="00:43:43.140" style="s2">everyone raises and then hands over to I</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.220" end="00:43:45.060" style="s2">don&#39;t some not-for-profit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.140" end="00:43:47.870" style="s2">actually for-profit and very much not</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.060" end="00:43:50.250" style="s2">for purpose and have it actually be</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.870" end="00:43:52.260" style="s2">crowdfunding campaign under the umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.250" end="00:43:54.840" style="s2">like instead of hey someone ought to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.260" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">research my thing actually finding all</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.840" end="00:43:59.850" style="s2">the people who have it any money that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:02.280" style="s2">donate any money that we fundraise goes</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.850" end="00:44:05.190" style="s2">into a pool and then who what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.280" end="00:44:06.930" style="s2">research do we want is anyone willing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.190" end="00:44:09.210" style="s2">do this study in this study in this</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.930" end="00:44:10.830" style="s2">study right well let you have funds or</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.210" end="00:44:12.030" style="s2">people who are like hey we&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.830" end="00:44:14.940" style="s2">this study and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.030" end="00:44:17.300" style="s2">for the money but very much based on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.940" end="00:44:20.340" style="s2">people who are directly impacted by that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.300" end="00:44:22.530" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s definitely on the long term</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.340" end="00:44:24.060" style="s2">roadmap for wiki election and I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.530" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">that&#39;s where reason score and we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.060" end="00:44:27.480" style="s2">actually kind of intersect is that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:28.770" style="s2">the realm of like trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.480" end="00:44:31.620" style="s2">evidence and where it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.770" end="00:44:33.000" style="s2">and like you know once you have a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.620" end="00:44:34.920" style="s2">collection of evidence you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.000" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">spot the blind spots you can say oh well</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.920" end="00:44:39.180" style="s2">people say they want this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:41.310" style="s2">evidence we only know of one study Oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.180" end="00:44:42.780" style="s2">interesting and then I think you engage</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.310" end="00:44:45.240" style="s2">both sides of the conversation and say</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.780" end="00:44:49.050" style="s2">what would a study look like that if it</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.240" end="00:44:50.610" style="s2">were done this way you know a decent</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.050" end="00:44:52.440" style="s2">number of both sides would be happy with</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.610" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">like yeah that study was well-designed</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.440" end="00:44:56.310" style="s2">you know it wasn&#39;t skewed one way or the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:58.500" style="s2">other and if it was actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.310" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">even if it came up against my side I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.500" end="00:45:03.270" style="s2">still be inclined to believe it like if</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:05.730" style="s2">it was you know free of the money coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.270" end="00:45:07.470" style="s2">in from the source that won&#39;t wants it</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.730" end="00:45:17.130" style="s2">to swing one way and anything else that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.470" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">it would be involved a idea via having a</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.130" end="00:45:20.280" style="s2">crowdfunding campaign that you first</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:22.410" style="s2">gather the people in the same like one</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.280" end="00:45:24.000" style="s2">year we&#39;re the direct stewards of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.410" end="00:45:25.560" style="s2">like the people have had breast cancer</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.000" end="00:45:27.930" style="s2">or like the direct stewards of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.560" end="00:45:29.990" style="s2">research for weirdest breast cancer</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.930" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">money go</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.990" end="00:45:33.270" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s based on how much</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:35.220" style="s2">money they physically bring in right</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.270" end="00:45:37.410" style="s2">even Bill Gates on vaccines would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.220" end="00:45:39.090" style="s2">like okay well if you prey on him in a I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.410" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with it being tied to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.090" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">dollar amount that you gave but even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">it was if it&#39;s still open for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:47.190" style="s2">else cuz vaccines is a good who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:49.050" style="s2">the stewards of vaccines well literally</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.190" end="00:45:51.060" style="s2">everyone right if you want people to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.050" end="00:45:52.860" style="s2">doing it but like what what evidence</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.060" end="00:45:55.740" style="s2">would be there any vaccines are a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.860" end="00:45:58.790" style="s2">good indication like the the controversy</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.740" end="00:46:01.440" style="s2">right now around aluminum adjuncts and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.790" end="00:46:02.910" style="s2">they&#39;re not super safe but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.440" end="00:46:04.320" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been using them for 50</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.910" end="00:46:06.210" style="s2">years there are actually things that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.320" end="00:46:09.780" style="s2">safer to use but we haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.210" end="00:46:12.390" style="s2">studying them for 50 years so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.780" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">we can&#39;t necessarily put new ones in</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.390" end="00:46:17.370" style="s2">because that would be experimenting on</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">humans which isn&#39;t okay but it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.370" end="00:46:21.240" style="s2">of okay 50 years ago so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.390" style="s2">something that is 50 year old technology</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.240" end="00:46:25.050" style="s2">that we have like I said we have a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.390" end="00:46:25.950" style="s2">better option</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.050" end="00:46:30.690" style="s2">but we&#39;re not going to do them because</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.950" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">this one has yeah I think it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.690" end="00:46:34.110" style="s2">part and we also see this with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.600" style="s2">current conversation around cook Ovid</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.110" end="00:46:38.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like a general misunderstanding of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.600" end="00:46:41.070" style="s2">science but the general public like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.970" end="00:46:42.990" style="s2">say if science says oh wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.070" end="00:46:45.030" style="s2">actually this thing instead they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.990" end="00:46:47.670" style="s2">also you were wrong in lying to us well</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.030" end="00:46:49.770" style="s2">no this is how science works we here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.670" end="00:46:52.440" style="s2">what we knew at the time we&#39;ve since</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.770" end="00:46:54.120" style="s2">changed we learn new things like and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.440" end="00:46:55.770" style="s2">when you&#39;re seeing how fast it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.120" end="00:46:57.390" style="s2">with Kohlberg we&#39;re like actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.770" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">this no it&#39;s that no it&#39;s this no wear</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.390" end="00:47:01.470" style="s2">masks no don&#39;t no do this no do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:05.460" style="s2">that&#39;s actually how science goes and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.470" end="00:47:07.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not a flaw in that that&#39;s just us</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.460" end="00:47:11.400" style="s2">doing it sort of publicly and more</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.880" end="00:47:13.290" style="s2">visibly than we would otherwise and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.400" end="00:47:15.150" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s a admitting that and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.290" end="00:47:17.790" style="s2">then be having something in place where</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.150" end="00:47:19.710" style="s2">you can spot the gaps and say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.790" end="00:47:21.240" style="s2">there is still going to be doing their</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.710" end="00:47:22.620" style="s2">research and and no one&#39;s going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.240" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">them so if Bill Gates wants to sponsor</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.620" end="00:47:27.870" style="s2">some studies on vaccines sure good go</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:29.790" style="s2">for it it will show who who who paid for</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.870" end="00:47:31.710" style="s2">it in case the people who are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.790" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">it want to know that and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.710" end="00:47:37.260" style="s2">start to say here&#39;s all the studies that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:39.000" style="s2">we we know about here&#39;s where the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.260" end="00:47:42.120" style="s2">funding from the different studies came</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.000" end="00:47:44.670" style="s2">from oh maybe the general public says oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.120" end="00:47:47.700" style="s2">I&#39;d like you know a more impartial study</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.670" end="00:47:49.890" style="s2">on the aluminum adjuvant great and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.700" end="00:47:51.450" style="s2">can you know design that but here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.890" end="00:47:53.010" style="s2">we know right now here&#39;s here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.450" end="00:47:54.600" style="s2">these studies lean and then if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.010" end="00:47:57.090" style="s2">anything that the public wants added</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.600" end="00:47:59.460" style="s2">cool well we can you know do a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.090" end="00:48:00.840" style="s2">fundraising for that where it&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.460" end="00:48:02.610" style="s2">of the influence that maybe the public</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.840" end="00:48:04.110" style="s2">that might be the problem that they have</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.610" end="00:48:05.430" style="s2">with it yeah there&#39;s five studies</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.110" end="00:48:07.380" style="s2">showing that but they&#39;re all paid for by</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.430" end="00:48:08.990" style="s2">pharmaceutical companies we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.380" end="00:48:11.340" style="s2">recently maybe we can&#39;t trust those</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.990" end="00:48:12.900" style="s2">let&#39;s fund one ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.340" end="00:48:15.990" style="s2">oh that&#39;s talking about the same way oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.900" end="00:48:19.740" style="s2">all right I think this is fine and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.990" end="00:48:21.000" style="s2">adjuncts I mean our good example I cook</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.740" end="00:48:22.830" style="s2">like well then just take the aluminum Oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.000" end="00:48:24.030" style="s2">like just don&#39;t have it in there and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.830" end="00:48:25.950" style="s2">you&#39;re like right but then the vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.030" end="00:48:27.390" style="s2">not effective because your immune system</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.950" end="00:48:29.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t recognize it as a foreign body</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.390" end="00:48:31.710" style="s2">and attack it it needs to heavy metal in</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.880" end="00:48:33.720" style="s2">there to be able to do that then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.710" end="00:48:35.070" style="s2">heavy metal comes at a cost and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.720" end="00:48:38.109" style="s2">like is there a better thing that our</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.070" end="00:48:39.789" style="s2">body will react to as an adjunct but not</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.109" end="00:48:42.460" style="s2">the heavy metal part of it my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.789" end="00:48:43.900" style="s2">yes but then it&#39;s not ethical to test on</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.460" end="00:48:46.809" style="s2">humans you can&#39;t have a double-blind</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.900" end="00:48:48.339" style="s2">study on vaccines at all let alone okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.809" end="00:48:50.019" style="s2">this one has this actor bunk to this one</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.339" end="00:48:51.819" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have this adjunct but even</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.019" end="00:48:53.319" style="s2">the public knowing that could be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.819" end="00:48:55.420" style="s2">you know what my kids not gonna get the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.319" end="00:48:57.999" style="s2">aluminum one but I would sign up for one</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.420" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">that isn&#39;t a heavy metal toxin if I felt</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.999" end="00:49:02.730" style="s2">that it was a safer option and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:05.769" style="s2">looking at those long turns heavy or</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.730" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">that becomes a more useful conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.769" end="00:49:09.309" style="s2">once you have a roadmap of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:11.319" style="s2">conversation because I know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.309" end="00:49:13.839" style="s2">things that the probe acts people sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.319" end="00:49:15.309" style="s2">of say against the anti fact is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.839" end="00:49:17.170" style="s2">they keep moving the goalposts so if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.309" end="00:49:18.789" style="s2">say here&#39;s the full but here&#39;s the full</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.170" end="00:49:21.579" style="s2">pealed here&#39;s all these different</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.789" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">ingredients and if there&#39;s one or two</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.579" end="00:49:24.670" style="s2">they&#39;re like ooh that one&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:26.499" style="s2">sketchy and maybe doesn&#39;t have all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.670" end="00:49:27.910" style="s2">proper research cool then we&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.499" end="00:49:29.710" style="s2">there is there anything else so we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.910" end="00:49:32.200" style="s2">do all the studies you know at the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.710" end="00:49:32.559" style="s2">time oh this one over here isn&#39;t perfect</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.200" end="00:49:34.150" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.559" end="00:49:36.369" style="s2">well within well do these two studies at</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.150" end="00:49:38.140" style="s2">the same time on these two things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.369" end="00:49:40.749" style="s2">other than that all the ingredients you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.140" end="00:49:43.779" style="s2">know are actually you know as safe as we</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.749" end="00:49:45.130" style="s2">can reasonably expect cool and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.779" end="00:49:47.739" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have a problem with you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.130" end="00:49:50.799" style="s2">know the pharmaceutical companies doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.739" end="00:49:52.509" style="s2">DD funding that the field might look</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.799" end="00:49:53.739" style="s2">great for them and they might have no</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.509" end="00:50:00.670" style="s2">problems in there already could going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.739" end="00:50:02.680" style="s2">vaccinate their kids mm-hmm this has</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.670" end="00:50:07.089" style="s2">been a really light session talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.680" end="00:50:10.930" style="s2">about politics and vaccines and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.089" end="00:50:15.819" style="s2">homie only with our group actually the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.930" end="00:50:18.730" style="s2">most the best argument for the vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.819" end="00:50:22.269" style="s2">would be to be transparent about who of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.730" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">the let&#39;s say big pharma people and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.269" end="00:50:29.079" style="s2">doctors and politicians actually did</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:31.329" style="s2">vaccine their own kids because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.079" end="00:50:35.650" style="s2">I had quite a few conference</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.329" end="00:50:39.569" style="s2">conversations about vaccines and science</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.650" end="00:50:43.499" style="s2">and how it works and my conclusion is</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.569" end="00:50:46.299" style="s2">it&#39;s very rare to find people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.499" end="00:50:50.680" style="s2">believe that vaccines are actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.299" end="00:50:51.850" style="s2">harmful and they know what even a study</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.680" end="00:50:55.270" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.850" end="00:50:56.710" style="s2">yes so most of the conversation I had</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.270" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">was about</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.710" end="00:51:02.590" style="s2">yeah it causes autism so we don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:06.700" style="s2">there&#39;s just no arguments to convince</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.590" end="00:51:11.590" style="s2">them otherwise or to even start to mmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.700" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">make them consider their options and if</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.590" end="00:51:16.210" style="s2">the question was okay what kind of study</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:20.320" style="s2">would you like to see in order for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.210" end="00:51:23.260" style="s2">to accept the thought that exists not</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.320" end="00:51:27.250" style="s2">completely harmful and the answer was no</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.260" end="00:51:29.530" style="s2">I know they are also just all studies</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.250" end="00:51:34.870" style="s2">are paid for by the big pharma and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.530" end="00:51:36.100" style="s2">that&#39;s it yeah and I think any tool that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.870" end="00:51:37.390" style="s2">you&#39;re making to help solve this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.100" end="00:51:38.650" style="s2">not gonna be a hundred percent some</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.390" end="00:51:40.090" style="s2">people have this already made up their</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.650" end="00:51:41.710" style="s2">minds and they&#39;re never going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:43.720" style="s2">but there are people that are sort of on</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.710" end="00:51:46.090" style="s2">the fence and in the middle and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.720" end="00:51:47.830" style="s2">like well you know of the ten vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.090" end="00:51:49.150" style="s2">those two seem okay because of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.830" end="00:51:53.020" style="s2">ingredients of it those two but not</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.150" end="00:51:55.750" style="s2">these three those people are they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.020" end="00:51:59.980" style="s2">lot more likely to sort of be willing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.750" end="00:52:02.950" style="s2">change their minds and as you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.980" end="00:52:05.260" style="s2">platform that sort of you know says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.950" end="00:52:07.300" style="s2">completely agnostic to everything and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.260" end="00:52:09.490" style="s2">then shows it like in politics in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.300" end="00:52:12.130" style="s2">and that in vaccines and in climate</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.490" end="00:52:15.160" style="s2">change if you&#39;re willing to sort of show</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.130" end="00:52:17.470" style="s2">unpopular opinions in some cases if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.160" end="00:52:19.060" style="s2">show something else that maybe somebody</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.470" end="00:52:20.680" style="s2">disagrees with like yeah but they agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.060" end="00:52:22.210" style="s2">with me on on those two and those - I</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.680" end="00:52:24.030" style="s2">did not expect them to agree with me on</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.210" end="00:52:27.000" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.030" end="00:52:30.100" style="s2">and for those people it&#39;s doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.000" end="00:52:31.690" style="s2">right yeah and I think once the people</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.100" end="00:52:34.060" style="s2">who are staunchly you know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.690" end="00:52:35.290" style="s2">staunchly Andy vaccine and I knew a</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.060" end="00:52:37.090" style="s2">couple people that was sort of in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.290" end="00:52:38.860" style="s2">middle and started off and he vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.090" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">and started to get exposed to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.860" end="00:52:43.930" style="s2">science that&#39;s the person who the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:45.690" style="s2">staunchly anti acting person that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.930" end="00:52:48.280" style="s2">probably the only person they listen to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.690" end="00:52:50.110" style="s2">if you&#39;re like look I agreed it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.280" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">because of you know it was all only</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.110" end="00:52:54.730" style="s2">funded by the pharmaceutical companies</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:56.610" style="s2">but since then we&#39;ve all funded these</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.730" end="00:52:59.140" style="s2">five new studies that actually show this</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.610" end="00:53:00.310" style="s2">interesting right and then it might be</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.140" end="00:53:01.300" style="s2">okay well they don&#39;t get those two</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.310" end="00:53:02.590" style="s2">vaccines because they have these</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.300" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">ingredients that you don&#39;t like but</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.590" end="00:53:05.150" style="s2">these three new ones don&#39;t don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:06.049" style="s2">that and they also</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.150" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">don&#39;t have these other two ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.049" end="00:53:10.130" style="s2">all the ingredients in those like</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:11.809" style="s2">they&#39;ve actually been listening to us</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.130" end="00:53:14.410" style="s2">and they have new vaccines Oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.809" end="00:53:14.410" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.279" end="00:53:26.510" style="s2">in the study nobody has ever taken me up</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.890" end="00:53:28.760" style="s2">on it but the pro backside I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.510" end="00:53:31.039" style="s2">like think of ten questions right no</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.760" end="00:53:32.900" style="s2">Google it brainstorm ten questions you</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.039" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">think should have been answered the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.900" end="00:53:37.010" style="s2">vaccines are safe and effective now look</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:38.539" style="s2">for studies is it has it been done and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.010" end="00:53:40.250" style="s2">no one&#39;s taking you up on it they&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.539" end="00:53:41.930" style="s2">just googled twelve facts that are pro</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.250" end="00:53:44.180" style="s2">mic Pro vaccine it&#39;s like that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.930" end="00:53:46.250" style="s2">same thing think of like you have a new</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.180" end="00:53:48.470" style="s2">kid you go to your doctor with these</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.250" end="00:53:49.940" style="s2">questions have they been answered that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.470" end="00:53:51.289" style="s2">was literally my experience was like</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.940" end="00:53:53.150" style="s2">well I just need these ten questions</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.289" end="00:53:55.579" style="s2">answered we&#39;ll be good to see my</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.150" end="00:53:57.710" style="s2">scientific curiosity maintained and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.579" end="00:53:59.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no answer there&#39;s no answer to</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.710" end="00:54:01.670" style="s2">the safe level of any of the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.210" end="00:54:03.470" style="s2">let alone all of the ingredients there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.670" end="00:54:06.490" style="s2">no long term studies about the health</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.470" end="00:54:09.470" style="s2">our long term effects of them and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.490" end="00:54:11.420" style="s2">dealing in that realm of science of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.470" end="00:54:13.220" style="s2">wait you just want me to shut up and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.420" end="00:54:15.230" style="s2">accept that studies that it&#39;s safe and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.220" end="00:54:16.190" style="s2">effective when you have zero evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.230" end="00:54:20.839" style="s2">show that it&#39;s safe and effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.190" end="00:54:23.089" style="s2">long-term yeah as somebody that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.839" end="00:54:25.579" style="s2">fairly in the middle I see that from</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.089" end="00:54:27.109" style="s2">both sides I see it that 98% of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.579" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">people participating in both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.109" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">conversation don&#39;t understand science</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.640" end="00:54:36.410" style="s2">and they&#39;re just initial reason they got</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:38.210" style="s2">them on one side or the other and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.410" end="00:54:39.950" style="s2">confirmation bias kicks in and then they</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.210" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">only will listen to studies from the one</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.950" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">side like I still consider myself mostly</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:49.339" style="s2">Pro vaccine but the conversations that I</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:50.720" style="s2">see pro-vaccine people having I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.339" end="00:54:52.849" style="s2">that&#39;s not helpful to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.720" end="00:54:56.539" style="s2">like if they&#39;re 100% safe and effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.849" end="00:54:58.520" style="s2">water isn&#39;t effective how can you say</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.539" end="00:55:00.619" style="s2">anything is well you look like wearing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.520" end="00:55:02.990" style="s2">masks right and there are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.619" end="00:55:05.869" style="s2">dying from wearing masks I think however</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.990" end="00:55:07.250" style="s2">if you consider what would have happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.869" end="00:55:09.020" style="s2">one way versus the other right there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.250" end="00:55:10.190" style="s2">some people who have breathing issues</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.020" end="00:55:11.450" style="s2">they probably shouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.190" end="00:55:13.220" style="s2">wearing them but they didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.450" end="00:55:14.630" style="s2">right there&#39;s people like young guys</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.220" end="00:55:16.430" style="s2">who&#39;ve been working out with them and</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.630" end="00:55:17.869" style="s2">died would they have died without one</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.430" end="00:55:18.680" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s young people who die all</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.869" end="00:55:20.240" style="s2">the time from her</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.680" end="00:55:22.430" style="s2">tax because how we eat and how our</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.240" end="00:55:24.470" style="s2">bodies aren&#39;t aren&#39;t so great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.430" end="00:55:27.680" style="s2">different people who die right same with</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.470" end="00:55:29.360" style="s2">like the automated car versus humans</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.680" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">driving it there&#39;s gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.360" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">different deaths but some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:38.690" style="s2">gonna die it&#39;s the overall cost of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:40.460" style="s2">and that is is not like how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.690" end="00:55:42.020" style="s2">dealing with masks I mean honestly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.460" end="00:55:43.820" style="s2">not that hard to wear a mask and yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.020" end="00:55:45.770" style="s2">some people are dying but like one in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.820" end="00:55:48.170" style="s2">millions versus if we don&#39;t wear them</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.770" end="00:55:49.880" style="s2">everyone gets coated eventually and our</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.170" end="00:55:51.110" style="s2">huge percentage of our population dies</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.880" end="00:55:52.340" style="s2">theoretically I haven&#39;t looked it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.110" end="00:55:55.100" style="s2">all the science but that&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.340" end="00:55:56.840" style="s2">understanding of it that if this is how</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.100" end="00:55:58.580" style="s2">we deal with masks I can only imagine</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.840" end="00:56:00.140" style="s2">once there&#39;s a vaccine and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.580" end="00:56:01.490" style="s2">going to be a one-time vaccine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.140" end="00:56:03.800" style="s2">gonna be something like the flu where</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.490" end="00:56:05.330" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yearly and so the only way</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.800" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">will be for them to implement it from</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.330" end="00:56:10.010" style="s2">the top down and like oh yeah well that</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:11.210" style="s2">works with masks when it&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.010" end="00:56:13.340" style="s2">asking something to put something over</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.210" end="00:56:18.110" style="s2">their face which is hard I&#39;ve had panic</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.340" end="00:56:21.800" style="s2">attacks or something anyway that its</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.110" end="00:56:23.780" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing how people&#39;s distrust of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.800" end="00:56:30.230" style="s2">both governments and science and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.780" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">medical system is valid and that it cost</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.230" end="00:56:33.380" style="s2">you - all of us at the same time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:35.240" style="s2">like right that we can&#39;t trust those</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.380" end="00:56:36.470" style="s2">people means how do we trust one versus</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.240" end="00:56:38.930" style="s2">the other you just pick a side and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.470" end="00:56:41.240" style="s2">find your confirmation bias because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.930" end="00:56:44.300" style="s2">cannot so you guys could step up with</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.240" end="00:56:54.620" style="s2">your reason things that we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.300" end="00:56:56.750" style="s2">third party tools that conceal the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.620" end="00:56:57.940" style="s2">reason score wheel spinning in Bentley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.750" end="00:57:05.120" style="s2">head throughout this whole conversation</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.940" end="00:57:08.210" style="s2">yeah I was just I was just thinking do</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.120" end="00:57:10.730" style="s2">you believe that we&#39;re where are you on</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.210" end="00:57:12.590" style="s2">vaccines right now I have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.730" end="00:57:14.210" style="s2">seven-year-old who was always going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.590" end="00:57:16.670" style="s2">get vaccinated in the future and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.210" end="00:57:19.430" style="s2">never met a doctor who can actually help</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.670" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">me feel safe about it so I my kid has</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.430" end="00:57:22.970" style="s2">not backs in fact the one vaccine I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:24.890" style="s2">gonna get her which was the measles when</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.970" end="00:57:26.690" style="s2">it was relevant because measles was in</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.890" end="00:57:27.860" style="s2">Vancouver and I called up and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.690" end="00:57:29.420" style="s2">like oh no we&#39;re not vaccinating</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.860" end="00:57:32.020" style="s2">kindergarteners till X I&#39;m like my kid</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.420" end="00:57:34.780" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been vaccinated they were like oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.020" end="00:57:37.060" style="s2">Percy says I was right whatever you had</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.780" end="00:57:38.890" style="s2">a window a one-week window when I was I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.060" end="00:57:41.560" style="s2">was feeling safe there was a greater</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.890" end="00:57:44.470" style="s2">anyway my kid is an accident and I get</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.560" end="00:57:46.420" style="s2">you so yeah I think that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.470" end="00:57:49.630" style="s2">topic for a reason score because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.420" end="00:57:55.300" style="s2">coming at it from an evidence-based</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.630" end="00:57:58.990" style="s2">mindset which I guess most the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.300" end="00:58:01.090" style="s2">anti-vaxxers kind of do that but yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.990" end="00:58:02.770" style="s2">if you have some time I know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.090" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">doing lots of videos that might be one</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.770" end="00:58:07.120" style="s2">that&#39;d be interesting to found out how</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:08.380" style="s2">to phrase the question and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.120" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">10 questions and we could put those</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.380" end="00:58:11.640" style="s2">right on reasons core and shine</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:17.350" style="s2">questions once I ask the doctor you mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.530" end="00:58:19.060" style="s2">right yeah yeah and so you just want</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.350" end="00:58:21.640" style="s2">like one of those questions so you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.060" end="00:58:24.250" style="s2">go reason score on it yeah well just</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.640" end="00:58:26.170" style="s2">cover the whole thing we want to work</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.250" end="00:58:29.380" style="s2">together on how to phrase the main</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.170" end="00:58:31.090" style="s2">question like it you know as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.380" end="00:58:35.050" style="s2">our vaccine safe because like you like</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.090" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">Adriel said nothing safe but you know is</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.050" end="00:58:43.000" style="s2">it is it is it a wise something up to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:43.740" style="s2">effective is it wise to vaccinate my</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.000" end="00:58:47.950" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.740" end="00:58:49.750" style="s2">considering be yeah I&#39;d be totally open</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.950" end="00:58:51.940" style="s2">to having that that conversation I do</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.750" end="00:58:54.760" style="s2">come at it from both a very logical</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.940" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">science basis but also a I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.760" end="00:58:59.380" style="s2">affected by negative things injected</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.730" style="s2">into my body and the science isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.380" end="00:59:02.560" style="s2">right so part of it is like my own</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.730" end="00:59:04.630" style="s2">personal bias my own personal trauma</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.560" end="00:59:05.950" style="s2">around the medical stuff and the science</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.630" end="00:59:08.920" style="s2">and the science isn&#39;t there to make me</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.950" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">feel safe it&#39;s for my drama and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.920" end="00:59:16.450" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m very open yeah I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:18.220" style="s2">decades of health issues because just</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.450" end="00:59:20.260" style="s2">the general information given out by our</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.220" end="00:59:24.130" style="s2">government and our doctors is inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.260" end="00:59:26.020" style="s2">it&#39;s an onion but yeah so yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.130" end="00:59:28.870" style="s2">so yeah if you have some time that would</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.020" end="00:59:31.870" style="s2">that be something I could use to help on</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.870" end="00:59:33.250" style="s2">our project so I can I do like how at</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.870" end="00:59:34.450" style="s2">the beginning of this but he&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.250" end="00:59:38.560" style="s2">don&#39;t want anything too controversial</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.450" end="00:59:42.550" style="s2">like climate change it then we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.560" end="00:59:44.590" style="s2">do vaccine backing vaccines are it would</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.550" end="00:59:46.390" style="s2">be big</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.590" end="00:59:48.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s something I&#39;m personally</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.390" end="00:59:50.410" style="s2">interested in records well and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.340" end="00:59:52.990" style="s2">starting relatively small like starting</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.410" end="00:59:55.060" style="s2">with sir a specific questions and not</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.990" end="00:59:55.930" style="s2">the overall I just like the hall keep it</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.060" end="00:59:58.630" style="s2">non-controversial</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.930" end="01:00:00.820" style="s2">let&#39;s do vaccines understand why though</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.630" end="01:00:03.010" style="s2">yeah I mean because there is like I have</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.820" end="01:00:05.620" style="s2">a kid that I&#39;m responsible for so that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.010" end="01:00:07.330" style="s2">is my number one concern it&#39;s not doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.620" end="01:00:10.330" style="s2">something that physically harms her it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.330" end="01:00:13.600" style="s2">my decision and a big piece of it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.330" end="01:00:16.150" style="s2">like the entire like just the bare bare</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.600" end="01:00:19.540" style="s2">basics what&#39;s in the vaccines and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.150" end="01:00:21.160" style="s2">is the safe level of them those two</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.540" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">questions alone it&#39;s like half the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.160" end="01:00:25.720" style="s2">doctors like how do I figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:27.940" style="s2">even in this well I&#39;m not too worried if</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.720" end="01:00:29.560" style="s2">you haven&#39;t looked into that but it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.940" end="01:00:31.390" style="s2">the but it&#39;s like the insert that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.560" end="01:00:33.220" style="s2">take out of everyone and they just chuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.390" end="01:00:35.140" style="s2">in the garbage is both the only evidence</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.220" end="01:00:38.020" style="s2">we have and we can&#39;t trust it</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.140" end="01:00:39.610" style="s2">simultaneously anything anyone had</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.020" end="01:00:40.870" style="s2">during the study is put in there so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.610" end="01:00:42.730" style="s2">someone had a heart attack looks like</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.870" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">that causes heart attack that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.730" end="01:00:46.900" style="s2">bad science and the only thing they have</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">to point to the whole thing once you</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.900" end="01:00:50.590" style="s2">started going down the rabbit hole it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:53.110" style="s2">a rabbit hole and that&#39;s why it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.590" end="01:00:54.550" style="s2">controversial is because there isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.110" end="01:00:58.060" style="s2">science that makes people feel safe</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.550" end="01:00:59.350" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been done when I looked into it 7</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.060" end="01:01:01.330" style="s2">years ago I mean maybe it&#39;s been done in</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.350" end="01:01:02.620" style="s2">between time but I haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.330" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">because all they ever say is like those</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.620" end="01:01:11.560" style="s2">anti backs there&#39;s an autism none of</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:16.690" style="s2">that was autism yeah yeah the dismissal</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.560" end="01:01:19.080" style="s2">is causing in this a big problem as</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.690" end="01:01:21.850" style="s2">opposed to just addressing even the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.080" end="01:01:23.410" style="s2">crazier concerns I mean I have seen it</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.850" end="01:01:26.140" style="s2">address but when people just do a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.410" end="01:01:27.910" style="s2">blanket dismissal it does cause it also</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.140" end="01:01:29.950" style="s2">gets tough when you&#39;ve got people that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.910" end="01:01:31.780" style="s2">like their meaning well on both sides</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.950" end="01:01:33.100" style="s2">but they don&#39;t actually understand it</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.780" end="01:01:34.990" style="s2">and so they chime in with something like</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.100" end="01:01:37.450" style="s2">it&#39;s 100% safe and effective like well</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.990" end="01:01:39.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not true so now that gives me</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.450" end="01:01:41.470" style="s2">doubt for anybody on that side talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.430" end="01:01:44.080" style="s2">about it and you&#39;ve got like a whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.470" end="01:01:47.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen quite a bit of evidence from</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.080" end="01:01:49.570" style="s2">you know each side and each side can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.230" end="01:01:51.790" style="s2">even agree on sort of how to argue did</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.570" end="01:01:54.550" style="s2">their points which isn&#39;t great for</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.790" end="01:01:56.320" style="s2">anybody who is unsure looking at both</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.550" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">sides you&#39;re like they&#39;re both so far in</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.320" end="01:01:58.309" style="s2">their camps that neither side is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:00.619" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.309" end="01:02:04.219" style="s2">we&#39;re going to look at evidence and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.619" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">information that might contradict what</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.219" end="01:02:10.660" style="s2">they currently believe which really is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:13.579" style="s2">it very useful for any sort of discourse</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.660" end="01:02:15.229" style="s2">when my kid was under two I was like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.579" end="01:02:16.819" style="s2">want to find a group of parents I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.229" end="01:02:18.589" style="s2">brainstorm what is everything we would</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.819" end="01:02:20.269" style="s2">want to know about it what do we know</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.589" end="01:02:23.329" style="s2">about it and do we feel safe enough to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.269" end="01:02:25.279" style="s2">do it and none of that&#39;s available it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.329" end="01:02:27.739" style="s2">basically just like shut up and listen</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.279" end="01:02:30.349" style="s2">to doctors all I can tell you how well</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.739" end="01:02:33.259" style="s2">that&#39;s worked in my life not at all</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.349" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">ever and they don&#39;t have the answers to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.259" end="01:02:36.680" style="s2">the questions and they all disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:38.809" style="s2">each other except on this one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.680" end="01:02:40.849" style="s2">none of them have studied like literally</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.809" end="01:02:42.229" style="s2">none of them except one that I talked to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.849" end="01:02:43.640" style="s2">you is actually looked into it their</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.229" end="01:02:44.779" style="s2">whole looking into it is just saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.640" end="01:02:46.519" style="s2">it&#39;s safe and effective because we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.779" end="01:02:49.759" style="s2">taught that in medical school yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.519" end="01:02:51.259" style="s2">although it&#39;s really shallow yeah both</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.759" end="01:02:52.729" style="s2">the doctors are practitioners and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.259" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the signs of anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.729" end="01:02:57.289" style="s2">they do and that&#39;s also why they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">giving me bad advice for several years I</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.289" end="01:03:00.979" style="s2">mean they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:03.049" style="s2">they&#39;re more like the bricklayers than</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.979" end="01:03:03.529" style="s2">the architects your primary care</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.049" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">physician</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.529" end="01:03:09.499" style="s2">unfortunately they should have the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:11.029" style="s2">knowledge I think and they&#39;ll work out</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.499" end="01:03:12.439" style="s2">well if they honored that right if they</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.029" end="01:03:14.209" style="s2">were like I&#39;m just a bricklayer and not</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.439" end="01:03:17.269" style="s2">the architect but they come into every</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.209" end="01:03:21.410" style="s2">conversation like I am the architect the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.269" end="01:03:23.089" style="s2">biggest architect and oh no no no like</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.410" end="01:03:25.099" style="s2">treat me as a god even though I discount</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.089" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">all the other gods yeah that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.099" end="01:03:30.939" style="s2">problem we we had a doctor just a little</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:34.729" style="s2">while ago and she was treating us so</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.939" end="01:03:36.739" style="s2">like idiots and like children and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.729" end="01:03:43.099" style="s2">like I think I&#39;ve read more papers on</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.739" end="01:03:47.779" style="s2">this than you have anyway yes I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.099" end="01:03:50.779" style="s2">done any time you want to chat I put in</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.779" end="01:03:51.979" style="s2">a lot of thought if scientific research</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.779" end="01:03:54.170" style="s2">because the stuff that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.979" end="01:03:55.339" style="s2">research isn&#39;t there and now my brain</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.170" end="01:03:58.429" style="s2">even if it was there wouldn&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.339" end="01:04:00.410" style="s2">read it so yeah all right we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.429" end="01:04:07.699" style="s2">hour mark does anyone have any rough you</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.410" end="01:04:08.520" style="s2">know thoughts before we say good I know</p>
