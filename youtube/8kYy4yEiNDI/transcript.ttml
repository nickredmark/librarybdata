<p begin="00:03:00.409" end="00:03:04.099" style="s2">pretty rapidly so I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.599" end="00:03:06.530" style="s2">about the origins of the term double</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.099" end="00:03:09.530" style="s2">consciousness and the and some</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.530" end="00:03:11.419" style="s2">definitions of it then I&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.530" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">about the background into why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.419" end="00:03:16.250" style="s2">actually interested in this area and why</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">it&#39;s relevant research for today and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.250" end="00:03:18.919" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to go into some</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:21.260" style="s2">examples and application areas then</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.919" end="00:03:22.909" style="s2">we&#39;re going to counter those application</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.260" end="00:03:24.349" style="s2">areas with some counter arguments and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.909" end="00:03:26.329" style="s2">then we&#39;re going to have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.349" end="00:03:29.810" style="s2">quantifiable benefits and some</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.329" end="00:03:30.650" style="s2">conclusions so in terms of a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.810" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk about today I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.650" end="00:03:34.010" style="s2">published a paper at the British</p>

<p begin="00:05:04.649" end="00:05:09.029" style="s2">and reality begins to be actively</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.869" end="00:05:13.289" style="s2">constructed rather than passively</p>

<p begin="00:05:16.589" end="00:05:23.639" style="s2">made me very interested in these forms</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.809" end="00:06:10.379" style="s2">one of the really interesting areas I</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:07.110" style="s2">back as if we&#39;re kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.340" end="00:07:10.229" style="s2">in a prison in this reality in the</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:19.410" style="s2">rehearsal for something else a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:21.750" style="s2">work is looking at the ancient mystery</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.410" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">schools and that&#39;s why I&#39;m so interested</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.750" end="00:07:25.830" style="s2">in the stoah because of you know the all</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.449" style="s2">the Greek philosophers went into those</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.830" end="00:07:30.090" style="s2">mystery schools into the inner mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.449" end="00:07:31.889" style="s2">eight hundred years they ran for and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.090" end="00:07:33.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know what exactly went on in there</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.889" end="00:07:36.449" style="s2">because initiates were sentenced to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.960" end="00:07:38.009" style="s2">death if they spoke about what what</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.449" end="00:07:39.570" style="s2">happened to them in those three days but</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.009" end="00:07:41.370" style="s2">we know almost certainly that there was</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.570" end="00:07:44.009" style="s2">a psychedelic involved we know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.370" end="00:07:46.860" style="s2">there was a rebirth and a death and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.009" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">rebirth process much like the Masons go</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.860" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">through today and we and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:54.690" style="s2">there was sensory deprivation etc so</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:56.699" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is that you enter</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.690" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">this liminal space and then you come</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.699" end="00:08:01.349" style="s2">back changed I also have my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:05.130" style="s2">experience you&#39;ll experience of a life</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.349" end="00:08:07.020" style="s2">review where I stopped living going</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.130" end="00:08:08.699" style="s2">forwards and my entire life was shown to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.020" end="00:08:11.789" style="s2">me in Reverse so I lived in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.699" end="00:08:13.380" style="s2">episodic states going backwards so I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.789" end="00:08:16.349" style="s2">in my normal state of consciousness but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.380" end="00:08:19.580" style="s2">also in my in my consciousness in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.349" end="00:08:22.380" style="s2">those episodic States and I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.580" end="00:08:24.300" style="s2">quite realize quite quickly that I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:25.860" style="s2">able to leave my body in that state in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.300" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">that in that double consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.860" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">enter a triple consciousness where I</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:30.690" style="s2">could enter anything else so I went and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:32.070" style="s2">the first thing I tried was going into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.690" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">table and experiencing what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.070" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">to be would does in the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:38.909" style="s2">being wood in myself and in myself a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">trip of consciousness and then long</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.909" end="00:08:41.579" style="s2">story showing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:45.240" style="s2">went back two years I was going out with</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.579" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">a girl in Berlin she got pregnant by</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.240" end="00:08:48.899" style="s2">mistake and in the time sheet she founds</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.690" style="s2">me up in I&#39;m in London shoots and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.899" end="00:08:54.089" style="s2">bonuses I&#39;m I&#39;m putting the abortions on</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.690" end="00:08:56.490" style="s2">Tuesday slams the phone down I go over</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.089" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">to Berlin she has the abortion she takes</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.490" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">a pill so it&#39;s very newly pregnant and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:03.270" style="s2">I&#39;m aware in my in my life of you that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:04.829" style="s2">can go into her body so I go into her</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.270" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">body and I don&#39;t and I experience what</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.829" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like to be pregnant I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:10.889" style="s2">experience all the anxiety etc cetera</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.240" end="00:09:13.470" style="s2">but then I&#39;m able to like choose to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.889" end="00:09:16.290" style="s2">into the womb and experience the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.470" end="00:09:18.239" style="s2">abortion at a cellular level so I mean a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.290" end="00:09:20.339" style="s2">quadruple consciousness in a parallel</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.239" end="00:09:23.459" style="s2">consciousness and for me this has really</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.339" end="00:09:25.049" style="s2">changed my perception of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.459" end="00:09:26.730" style="s2">consciousness is and this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.049" end="00:09:29.759" style="s2">consciousness and literacy is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.730" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">talking about here so if we think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.759" end="00:09:33.509" style="s2">paradox management that&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:35.910" style="s2">that can have that double consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.509" end="00:09:38.069" style="s2">can help holding two positions at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.910" end="00:09:41.489" style="s2">same time I mean if we think about a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.069" end="00:09:45.119" style="s2">tree a dead tree in the forest it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.489" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">an ecosystem of new life so what what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.119" end="00:09:50.489" style="s2">that that is the paradox of this this</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:52.679" style="s2">state that we&#39;re in and a great point</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.489" end="00:09:54.839" style="s2">from rebel wisdom our festival recently</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.679" end="00:09:57.269" style="s2">David fuller mentioned that we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.839" end="00:10:00.149" style="s2">self terminating system but we are also</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.269" end="00:10:04.829" style="s2">in the best time to be alive so how can</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.149" end="00:10:06.269" style="s2">both things be true and how can we hold</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.829" end="00:10:09.109" style="s2">those two perspectives without</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.269" end="00:10:11.519" style="s2">collapsing one into the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.109" end="00:10:13.679" style="s2">so yeah we&#39;re in a deeply fragile</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:15.410" style="s2">situation right now but what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.679" end="00:10:19.199" style="s2">to come up with is solutions</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.410" end="00:10:22.589" style="s2">and whether we can gain something from</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.199" end="00:10:23.850" style="s2">this parallel living and if we think so</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.589" end="00:10:25.949" style="s2">moving on to some examples and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.850" end="00:10:28.259" style="s2">application areas we think about optical</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.949" end="00:10:30.540" style="s2">illusions one of the key attributes or</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.259" end="00:10:33.569" style="s2">functions of double consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.540" end="00:10:35.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve mentioned is this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.569" end="00:10:38.189" style="s2">ability to expand your perceptual field</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:40.949" style="s2">to give access at one at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.189" end="00:10:43.799" style="s2">to two distinctly theater two distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.949" end="00:10:46.439" style="s2">different fields of experience my</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.799" end="00:10:48.749" style="s2">colleague Kevin Davidson in the paper I</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.439" end="00:10:51.059" style="s2">mentioned he talked about optical</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.749" end="00:10:53.489" style="s2">illusions with optical illusions there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.059" end="00:10:56.220" style="s2">a moment of pleasure when the second</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.489" end="00:10:58.499" style="s2">perspective comes into focus it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.220" end="00:11:01.079" style="s2">like a little flash of enlightenment as</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.499" end="00:11:03.509" style="s2">our awareness broadens like suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.079" end="00:11:05.449" style="s2">seeing out of a part of our eyes which</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.509" end="00:11:07.709" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have access to before</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.449" end="00:11:09.209" style="s2">experiences such as these are like</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.709" end="00:11:11.819" style="s2">medicine for our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.209" end="00:11:13.709" style="s2">broadening our perceptive bandwidth and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.819" end="00:11:16.489" style="s2">leaving us with an awareness that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.709" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">agents in constructing our reality so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.489" end="00:11:20.939" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely central to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.779" end="00:11:23.429" style="s2">thesis so I&#39;ll talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.939" end="00:11:24.690" style="s2">some examples a robot and a paper so</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.429" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">living in virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.690" end="00:11:28.950" style="s2">we&#39;re running a protocol seeing-eye with</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.950" end="00:11:33.060" style="s2">through somebody else for a month we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.290" end="00:11:35.370" style="s2">already launched it I was electrónica in</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.060" end="00:11:39.330" style="s2">Austria where he lived through 14</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.370" end="00:11:41.880" style="s2">different people in in 14 days and so he</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.330" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">was a so he&#39;s wearing virtual reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.880" end="00:11:45.000" style="s2">but he&#39;s not looking into a game</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:46.470" style="s2">environment he&#39;s looking into somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.000" end="00:11:49.370" style="s2">else&#39;s eyes so somebody else has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.470" end="00:11:51.840" style="s2">wearing a camera recording their day and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.370" end="00:11:55.890" style="s2">and so he&#39;s looking through their day</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.840" end="00:11:59.610" style="s2">and basically not accessing his own his</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.890" end="00:12:01.800" style="s2">own hearing or his own sight and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.610" end="00:12:03.120" style="s2">reason why he originally chose 28 days</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.800" end="00:12:05.550" style="s2">is because that&#39;s how long it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.120" end="00:12:07.530" style="s2">form habits and what he wants to try and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.550" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">do is dissolve his own identity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.530" end="00:12:12.090" style="s2">adopt somebody else&#39;s to see if this</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">idea of we all know that the self is a</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:22.140" style="s2">so he&#39;s testing that and seeing how much</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:23.970" style="s2">we can dissolve it and you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.140" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">also got loads of examples now in</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.970" end="00:12:28.350" style="s2">virtual reality there&#39;s one that&#39;s quite</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.889" end="00:16:28.339" style="s2">question is point of view is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.819" end="00:16:30.759" style="s2">whenever I take DMT I see this language</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.339" end="00:16:33.259" style="s2">at the core of my vision which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.759" end="00:16:34.879" style="s2">consistent and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.259" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">ancient and modern at the same time if</p>

<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:42.829" style="s2">a DMT extended-stay I could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.910" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">sit there and draw it and bring back</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.829" end="00:16:48.170" style="s2">something from this this dream state a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:49.730" style="s2">lot of you know all of us struggle tips</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.170" end="00:16:51.410" style="s2">further to remember our dreams as soon</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.730" end="00:16:53.240" style="s2">as I need them we in the morning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.410" end="00:16:56.420" style="s2">it as soon as that process is happening</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.240" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">my dream is rapidly disappearing so I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.420" end="00:17:01.189" style="s2">love to bring things back from dream</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">states and and there&#39;s arguments</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.189" end="00:17:06.709" style="s2">especially out for stimulants research</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:10.309" style="s2">that DMT in terms of brain signature is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.709" end="00:17:14.150" style="s2">very similar to a dreaming state and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.309" end="00:17:16.159" style="s2">then another example would be so just to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.150" end="00:17:19.370" style="s2">finish on that so a DMT extended</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.159" end="00:17:21.049" style="s2">experience or a DMT experience even you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.370" end="00:17:23.390" style="s2">know if your body is kept in a pod</p>

<p begin="00:17:24.589" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">cream since you&#39;re just in hyperspace</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.949" end="00:17:31.490" style="s2">and a more authentic example of double</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">consciousness you could argue is</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.490" end="00:17:35.299" style="s2">something that I learned from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:37.669" style="s2">brilliant podcast by Lauren fields with</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.299" end="00:17:41.419" style="s2">Andy lecture where he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.669" end="00:17:44.510" style="s2">the difference between cordyceps and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.419" end="00:17:46.909" style="s2">general synergistic value of mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.510" end="00:17:49.340" style="s2">magic mushrooms so cordyceps is when an</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.909" end="00:17:52.820" style="s2">ant is infected by this mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.340" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">cordyceps and the ant carries on as</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.820" end="00:17:58.340" style="s2">normal doesn&#39;t really know it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:18:00.620" style="s2">infected and it&#39;s literally the mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.340" end="00:18:02.929" style="s2">is infected it&#39;s muscles it&#39;s around its</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.620" end="00:18:04.550" style="s2">brain and when when the mushroom decides</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.929" end="00:18:07.400" style="s2">it wants to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.550" end="00:18:09.080" style="s2">it triggers the the aunt into this</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.400" end="00:18:11.330" style="s2">remote controlled state where it climbs</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.080" end="00:18:13.190" style="s2">to the tallest tree it can find it</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.790" end="00:18:24.950" style="s2">and it basically then needs to you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.250" end="00:18:28.220" style="s2">the the the the body of the ad is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.950" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">dissolved and then mushrooms come out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.220" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">the body of the an and spores come out</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">of the mushroom spreading to all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:38.420" style="s2">ants beneath so you know again not</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:40.610" style="s2">really a double consciousness even</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.420" end="00:18:42.470" style="s2">though you could argue that yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.610" end="00:18:44.780" style="s2">mushroom are cohabiting the same space</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.470" end="00:18:47.690" style="s2">at a certain time but it&#39;s more of a</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.690" end="00:18:53.240" style="s2">you think about the psilocybin</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.190" end="00:27:03.880" style="s2">like I mentioned this idea of holding</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.900" end="00:27:32.679" style="s2">drummer so it&#39;s this all of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.510" end="00:27:35.740" style="s2">stuff and these does brilliant work</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.679" end="00:27:39.880" style="s2">around race and prisoners and all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.740" end="00:27:41.890" style="s2">rest of it and I think that the sixth</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.880" end="00:27:44.110" style="s2">benefit is this idea of reimagining the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.890" end="00:27:45.850" style="s2">imagination or encouraging the use of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.110" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">imagination and a lot of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.850" end="00:27:50.200" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:53.110" style="s2">is about the imagination of course and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.200" end="00:27:54.909" style="s2">Kevin Davidson against States I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.110" end="00:27:57.340" style="s2">this is fundamental to child development</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.909" end="00:28:00.039" style="s2">we talk about the Waldorf schools as</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.340" end="00:28:01.870" style="s2">schooling the imagination it&#39;s ever more</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.039" end="00:28:03.580" style="s2">important when children are having a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.870" end="00:28:06.130" style="s2">of their imagination done for them and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.580" end="00:28:09.580" style="s2">they&#39;re and they have less opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.130" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">to be bored with nothing to do ie no</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.580" end="00:28:14.409" style="s2">sensory input coming at them watching</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:17.169" style="s2">Disney films is like toxic white sugar</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.409" end="00:28:20.200" style="s2">for the imagination you&#39;ve planted a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.169" end="00:28:23.020" style="s2">seed for something about what the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.200" end="00:28:24.669" style="s2">driving edge of VR can teach you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.020" end="00:28:27.730" style="s2">how we prepare children for the future</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.669" end="00:28:30.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s all for me about not replacing</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.730" end="00:28:32.470" style="s2">imagination with computer animation not</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.130" end="00:28:34.270" style="s2">being prescriptive creating worlds that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.470" end="00:28:36.280" style="s2">are declarative that our maps that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.270" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">can walk around without being told where</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.280" end="00:28:42.429" style="s2">to go so to conclude obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.650" style="s2">problem with double consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.429" end="00:28:47.799" style="s2">that it implies a polarity it implies</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.650" end="00:28:51.940" style="s2">Jew and dualism and consciousness itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.799" end="00:28:53.710" style="s2">is obviously infinite to us although we</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.940" end="00:28:55.390" style="s2">may just spend all of our times in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.710" end="00:28:58.110" style="s2">reception room of our minds rather than</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.390" end="00:29:00.490" style="s2">in the infinity of our potential and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.110" end="00:29:03.400" style="s2">which is what I&#39;m hoping to open and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.490" end="00:29:04.900" style="s2">unlock this this human potential rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.400" end="00:29:06.309" style="s2">than the human downgrading that what</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.900" end="00:29:08.110" style="s2">we&#39;re doing with current technologies</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.309" end="00:29:09.490" style="s2">with these tiny little screens and small</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.110" end="00:29:11.860" style="s2">real estate</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.490" end="00:29:13.900" style="s2">so different belts demonstrate there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.860" end="00:29:15.880" style="s2">many manifestations of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.900" end="00:29:18.400" style="s2">there are as many manifestations of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.880" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">consciousness as there are beings all</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.400" end="00:29:22.059" style="s2">coexisting in the universe and the</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.059" end="00:29:27.670" style="s2">so pluralism represents multiple ways of</p>

<p begin="00:29:43.080" end="00:29:49.809" style="s2">holding on to with this integral view</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.470" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">holding on to multiplicity hybridity the</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.400" style="s2">the non dual vision of unity is that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.360" end="00:30:10.600" style="s2">dissolves the radical claim of the other</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.809" end="00:32:48.550" style="s2">what I the first thing I wanted to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.059" end="00:32:50.500" style="s2">say is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.550" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">I really enjoyed that you didn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.500" end="00:32:53.650" style="s2">slides this time around because the last</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:55.060" style="s2">time I listened to you you did use</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.650" end="00:32:57.130" style="s2">slides and there&#39;s a lot of insane</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.060" end="00:33:00.340" style="s2">beautiful content that you use there so</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.130" end="00:33:01.870" style="s2">for all the people listening on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.340" end="00:33:03.580" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a few presentations where</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.870" end="00:33:05.800" style="s2">call presents some of these ideas using</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.580" end="00:33:06.700" style="s2">some some of the slides that emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.800" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">the content so I highly recommend</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.700" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">checking that out and so there are quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">a few cool questions in the in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:21.220" style="s2">box but before we go there I had a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:24.750" style="s2">question but I&#39;m thinking of how to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.220" end="00:33:26.890" style="s2">rephrase it after this this presentation</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.750" end="00:33:31.030" style="s2">one thing I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.890" end="00:33:33.010" style="s2">is I think it comes from Alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.030" end="00:33:34.300" style="s2">where he says something like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.010" end="00:33:35.590" style="s2">machines are going to be the best at</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.300" end="00:33:40.270" style="s2">being the machines right they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.590" end="00:33:42.730" style="s2">be absolutely great AI all that so we as</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.270" end="00:33:44.530" style="s2">humans should be the best humans that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.730" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">can be right so that we can later</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.530" end="00:33:49.330" style="s2">develop some sort of symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.220" style="s2">intelligence between these two and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:53.260" style="s2">he uses logos to talk about the machine</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.220" end="00:33:56.440" style="s2">and pathos to talk about the human and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.260" end="00:34:02.260" style="s2">then to find a shared Methos between</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.440" end="00:34:05.020" style="s2">those two and so I guess a question in</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.260" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">that regard would be that it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.020" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">you&#39;re expanding what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:14.679" style="s2">human in some ways and and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:16.360" style="s2">able to do as humans so you call it</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.679" end="00:34:18.550" style="s2">hyper humanism so maybe if you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.360" end="00:34:20.860" style="s2">riff a bit on hyper humanism and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.550" end="00:34:25.120" style="s2">perhaps also share what your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.860" end="00:34:26.710" style="s2">are on where this narrative will come</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.120" end="00:34:28.990" style="s2">from right I mean we can have these</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.710" end="00:34:32.050" style="s2">practices that will inform the things</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.990" end="00:34:33.940" style="s2">that we do but you don&#39;t don&#39;t you sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.050" end="00:34:37.480" style="s2">that we need us some sort of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.940" end="00:34:41.500" style="s2">to inform our actions in the future yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.480" end="00:34:44.980" style="s2">so the hyper humanist stuff is a counter</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.500" end="00:34:47.350" style="s2">to a transhumanist agenda so I did a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.980" end="00:34:51.160" style="s2">keynote with Ray Kurzweil last year in</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.350" end="00:34:53.380" style="s2">Melbourne innovation and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.160" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">we were framing around intelligence 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.380" end="00:34:59.050" style="s2">like what where where do we go with this</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:35:02.650" style="s2">stuff and we look at the transhumanist</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.050" end="00:35:04.570" style="s2">there they&#39;re trying to prolong life</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.650" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">potentially indefinitely although Ray</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.570" end="00:35:08.230" style="s2">was unwell at the time and started to</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.190" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">sort of talk about maybe for a long life</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.230" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">a certain quality of life rather than</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:18.250" style="s2">indefinite extension and and also</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:19.960" style="s2">they&#39;re very much dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.250" end="00:35:22.780" style="s2">technology and what I&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.960" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">with my work is find those those</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.780" end="00:35:28.600" style="s2">opportunities where we can use a</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:32.110" style="s2">technology to kick-start an ability that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.600" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">we may already have in our analog world</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.110" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">in our analog world is being rocked</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.720" style="s2">we&#39;re being robbed of our analog</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:41.620" style="s2">abilities because of poorly designed</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.720" end="00:35:44.200" style="s2">technologies and you know I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.620" end="00:35:45.670" style="s2">quoting this example from from cyborg</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.200" end="00:35:47.710" style="s2">myths because I work with them on on</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.670" end="00:35:52.450" style="s2">there and they&#39;re news central north</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.710" end="00:35:54.370" style="s2">sense which is about to updated and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.450" end="00:35:56.830" style="s2">all it is is a little chip that you wear</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.370" end="00:35:58.780" style="s2">and their tagline is transhumanist one</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.830" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">they say we don&#39;t want to we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.780" end="00:36:04.450" style="s2">to wear technology we want to become it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:07.270" style="s2">and and I I think that&#39;s problematic</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.450" end="00:36:11.230" style="s2">primarily because you know we may have</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.270" end="00:36:12.760" style="s2">already had the north sense and lost it</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.230" end="00:36:14.710" style="s2">because of the use of technology and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.760" end="00:36:18.250" style="s2">think technology atrophies muscles that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.710" end="00:36:19.750" style="s2">we actually have anyway an example is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.250" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">one of my friends you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.750" end="00:36:24.250" style="s2">use the internet until he absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.210" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">needs to because it&#39;s a giant brain and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.250" end="00:36:27.490" style="s2">he wants to actually find things out for</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:29.890" style="s2">himself so of course that can&#39;t be often</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.490" end="00:36:32.950" style="s2">often the case but to go back to cyborgs</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.890" end="00:36:34.630" style="s2">nest I think the the general idea is</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.950" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">that yeah it vibrates every time you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.630" end="00:36:39.170" style="s2">face north after a few weeks you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:40.920" style="s2">that as a new sense you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.170" end="00:36:44.140" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.920" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">but also this there&#39;s an example from a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.140" end="00:36:48.760" style="s2">different device called feel space which</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:50.890" style="s2">is where you wear a belt</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.760" end="00:36:52.990" style="s2">it&#39;s got vibration motors in it it</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.890" end="00:36:55.420" style="s2">vibrates every time you face north in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.990" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">exactly the same way but the difference</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.420" end="00:36:59.500" style="s2">is is that you take that off with this</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:02.140" style="s2">with a cyborg mist version you leave it</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.500" end="00:37:04.900" style="s2">on and it&#39;s permanently attached to you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.140" end="00:37:07.090" style="s2">the field space belt you take off after</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.900" end="00:37:09.910" style="s2">six to eight weeks and you still have</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.090" end="00:37:12.340" style="s2">that new sense so I&#39;m really interested</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.910" end="00:37:15.070" style="s2">in like you know imagine stabilizers on</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.340" end="00:37:16.390" style="s2">your bike you remove the stabilizers and</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.070" end="00:37:18.789" style="s2">you have the new skin</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.390" end="00:37:21.700" style="s2">cycling so that&#39;s how I see technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.789" end="00:37:24.069" style="s2">and that&#39;s human isms I&#39;m unlocking your</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.700" end="00:37:26.019" style="s2">innate human abilities or human</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.069" end="00:37:28.059" style="s2">potential but you didn&#39;t know you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.019" end="00:37:30.130" style="s2">and maybe just using technology catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.059" end="00:37:32.890" style="s2">to get there I can you remind me the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.130" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">second part of the question it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:37.450" style="s2">about the narrative about how we should</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:41.950" style="s2">be using this so how do we inform that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.450" end="00:37:43.569" style="s2">guess the ethos like what is the I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.950" end="00:37:45.089" style="s2">it sounds amazing all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.569" end="00:37:51.700" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.089" end="00:37:54.549" style="s2">experimental in some ways right but is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.700" end="00:37:56.410" style="s2">that what is there any sense of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.549" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">that you rely on I guess in a bit in</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.410" end="00:38:02.380" style="s2">some sense um well I think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">I&#39;m so fascinated by creating frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.380" end="00:38:06.220" style="s2">of you surround these things and I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.589" style="s2">a lot of the time it&#39;s it&#39;s a literacy</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.220" end="00:38:10.210" style="s2">thing I mean Quitely working on a death</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.589" end="00:38:11.589" style="s2">literacy project because I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.210" end="00:38:19.000" style="s2">all in the death shadow at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.589" end="00:38:21.039" style="s2">and and I think it&#39;s you know it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.000" end="00:38:23.529" style="s2">around education like the same with</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.039" end="00:38:25.420" style="s2">psychedelics you know that this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.529" end="00:38:27.519" style="s2">certain frameworks of uses around set</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.420" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">and setting and I&#39;m understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.519" end="00:38:31.390" style="s2">you know certain setting it&#39;s just as</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.829" style="s2">important as the actual substance same</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.390" end="00:38:35.079" style="s2">with technology the hype humanists</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.829" end="00:38:37.960" style="s2">approach I think that people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.079" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">aware of it and they&#39;re losing their you</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.960" end="00:38:43.450" style="s2">know we give we give up so much agency</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:45.490" style="s2">to the technologies and that we we lose</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.450" end="00:38:49.299" style="s2">the fact that we are the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.490" end="00:38:51.519" style="s2">technology and that&#39;s that&#39;s it for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.299" end="00:38:54.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all of all about you know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.519" end="00:38:55.930" style="s2">do we get there with our own their own</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.039" end="00:38:58.089" style="s2">stuff and how do we how do we educate</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.930" end="00:39:00.519" style="s2">ourselves I think that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.089" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">technologies are being co-opted the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.519" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">agendas of the of the corporations are</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:08.500" style="s2">not they&#39;re not looking out for us so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:11.349" style="s2">think it&#39;s about DIY approaches it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.500" end="00:39:13.359" style="s2">about getting good news stories out</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.349" end="00:39:15.369" style="s2">there around technology and Tristan</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.359" end="00:39:17.319" style="s2">Harris the sense of humane technology is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.369" end="00:39:20.859" style="s2">doing a fantastic job very succinctly</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.410" end="00:39:55.060" style="s2">my question was I I hear this tension in</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">these kind of like technological realms</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.060" end="00:40:00.790" style="s2">between the opportunities we have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.640" end="00:40:03.610" style="s2">explore and the temptations we may have</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.790" end="00:40:05.680" style="s2">to escape I&#39;m wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.610" end="00:40:07.960" style="s2">speak a little bit on how we can like</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.680" end="00:40:10.600" style="s2">tell in our bodies the difference</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.960" end="00:40:12.100" style="s2">between those two impulses in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.600" end="00:40:15.480" style="s2">so that we can try to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.100" end="00:40:19.600" style="s2">sensitivity and make better decisions</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.480" end="00:40:21.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a good one isn&#39;t it I think I</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.600" end="00:40:24.310" style="s2">think you&#39;re right because we&#39;re so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.640" end="00:40:26.920" style="s2">mean again my friend Jackie Lucas</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.310" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">talking about young people how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.920" end="00:40:32.200" style="s2">very much used to this low-level</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:34.510" style="s2">stimulation all the time so they&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.200" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">of like they&#39;re not getting bored</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.510" end="00:40:41.250" style="s2">they&#39;re not feeling into the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:43.780" style="s2">these technologies are uh you know just</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.250" end="00:40:45.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not your friend a</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.350" end="00:40:51.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a brilliant example where my</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.810" end="00:40:54.820" style="s2">friend Hannah and a close was talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.610" end="00:40:57.400" style="s2">about this is article about Buddhism and</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.450" end="00:41:25.750" style="s2">mean it&#39;s like I think that it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.789" end="00:42:07.989" style="s2">is so prevalent and I think again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.249" end="00:42:12.759" style="s2">literacy around escapism</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.989" end="00:42:16.269" style="s2">but we need to generate thank you for</p>

<p begin="00:42:16.269" end="00:42:23.079" style="s2">follow up question would be Peter Peters</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.660" end="00:42:25.630" style="s2">question Thank You Nick it might have</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.079" end="00:42:27.579" style="s2">already been asked eldest hour answered</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:30.609" style="s2">I should say but I&#39;ll ask it again in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.579" end="00:42:32.859" style="s2">the asking the frame that I worded in</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.609" end="00:42:34.660" style="s2">okay so once you have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.859" end="00:42:35.979" style="s2">psychology of states in the survey if</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.660" end="00:42:38.559" style="s2">you have the capacity for ontological</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.979" end="00:42:40.869" style="s2">diversity how do you determine what</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.559" end="00:42:44.349" style="s2">state to access like how do you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.869" end="00:42:45.249" style="s2">like navigate them and it&#39;s like what 2</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.349" end="00:42:46.930" style="s2">maybes question if we&#39;re not gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.249" end="00:42:49.059" style="s2">consumers of cautiousness know what are</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.930" end="00:42:50.349" style="s2">we going to be like explorers there&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.059" end="00:42:55.029" style="s2">something more to be than just an</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.349" end="00:42:56.499" style="s2">explorer yeah I mean it&#39;s practice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.029" end="00:42:58.390" style="s2">absolutely practice and it comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.499" end="00:43:00.699" style="s2">the state shifting thing you know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.390" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;re you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.699" end="00:43:05.190" style="s2">having these feedback loops that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:07.150" style="s2">neurofeedback creates this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.190" end="00:43:09.719" style="s2">you know much like the quantified self</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.150" end="00:43:14.499" style="s2">idea that you&#39;re you&#39;re accessing these</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.719" end="00:43:16.900" style="s2">these these realms of the inner the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.499" end="00:43:19.719" style="s2">inner machinery and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.900" end="00:43:20.259" style="s2">brilliant question Thea because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.719" end="00:43:23.829" style="s2">it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.259" end="00:43:27.819" style="s2">alien to us that we have all this these</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.829" end="00:43:31.319" style="s2">inner realms and and yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.819" end="00:43:33.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s practice it&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.319" end="00:43:35.769" style="s2">literacy it&#39;s about knowing that you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.940" end="00:43:37.900" style="s2">do these things I mean I&#39;ve just signed</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.769" end="00:43:41.170" style="s2">up for the thinker the finders course</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.900" end="00:43:44.499" style="s2">which is thousand different types of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.170" end="00:43:47.859" style="s2">meditation and you know it&#39;s pick a mix</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.499" end="00:43:49.390" style="s2">kind of 17 week course and Josh fields</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.859" end="00:43:51.219" style="s2">actually recommended it to me because</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.390" end="00:43:53.690" style="s2">one of my big projects is this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.219" end="00:43:55.490" style="s2">how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.690" end="00:43:57.490" style="s2">I mean uh what I&#39;ve learnt from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.490" end="00:44:00.050" style="s2">psychedelic society with Jose is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.490" end="00:44:02.030" style="s2">it&#39;s very niche you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.050" end="00:44:05.180" style="s2">create altered states with technology</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.030" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a niche area but what</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.180" end="00:44:08.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t niche is the fact that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:09.770" style="s2">thousand different types of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.030" end="00:44:11.600" style="s2">we have a thousand different types of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.770" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">breathing we have a thousand different</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.600" end="00:44:16.520" style="s2">types of dance so how can we put all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:18.620" style="s2">those things how can we create stacks as</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.520" end="00:44:20.270" style="s2">in like Jamie will talks a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.620" end="00:44:21.740" style="s2">these idea we&#39;ve got the breath work</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.270" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the meditation we&#39;ve got all</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.740" end="00:44:26.840" style="s2">these things that are already there and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:28.610" style="s2">it&#39;s around practicing like different</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.840" end="00:44:30.830" style="s2">breathing techniques to see what what</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.610" end="00:44:32.840" style="s2">ontological stake it results in and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.830" end="00:44:34.520" style="s2">obviously we have cultural differences</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.840" end="00:44:37.340" style="s2">and gender differences and everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.520" end="00:44:42.500" style="s2">else so it&#39;s citizen science actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.340" end="00:44:45.460" style="s2">approach that we need to create it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.500" end="00:44:47.780" style="s2">know it&#39;s this it&#39;s this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.460" end="00:44:51.050" style="s2">start with some meditation do some</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.780" end="00:44:52.310" style="s2">breath work go into VR experience come</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.050" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">out of the view experience maybe take a</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.310" end="00:44:57.410" style="s2">microdose do some more breath work you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:59.210" style="s2">know it&#39;s endless</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.410" end="00:45:01.370" style="s2">it&#39;s endless and that&#39;s why frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:06.290" style="s2">are so important if you have a five</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.370" end="00:45:09.020" style="s2">question regarding the framework to like</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.290" end="00:45:10.250" style="s2">so I&#39;m reminded the my cultural analysis</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.020" end="00:45:11.510" style="s2">where there&#39;s like an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.250" end="00:45:13.670" style="s2">memeplex is out there in the noosphere</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.510" end="00:45:14.930" style="s2">and the idea is once you have an</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.670" end="00:45:16.310" style="s2">intimacy with them not only a</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.930" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">propositional level but on a felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.310" end="00:45:19.640" style="s2">level you can get into right</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:22.040" style="s2">relationship from them and then get this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.640" end="00:45:23.780" style="s2">signal get the truth without getting</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.040" end="00:45:26.750" style="s2">triggered or hijacked by their sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.780" end="00:45:28.700" style="s2">echoic machinations and I&#39;m seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.750" end="00:45:29.990" style="s2">sort of a similar project where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.700" end="00:45:32.600" style="s2">an ecology of different ontological</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.990" end="00:45:34.610" style="s2">states and then one of the first moves</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.600" end="00:45:36.020" style="s2">is just to be an explorer there so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.610" end="00:45:38.030" style="s2">can get into right relationship with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.020" end="00:45:40.910" style="s2">and then you can know what to turn on</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.030" end="00:45:43.310" style="s2">when you need to turn it on is that sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.910" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">of the right read yeah absolutely and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.310" end="00:45:48.590" style="s2">think that it&#39;s that it&#39;s that holistic</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:50.870" style="s2">approach way and that&#39;s why I love all</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.590" end="00:45:52.940" style="s2">the rebel wisdom stuff and in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.870" end="00:45:56.390" style="s2">making in the meaning crisis because</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.940" end="00:45:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s all about feeling we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.390" end="00:46:02.630" style="s2">thinking ourselves to death and I think</p>

<p begin="00:46:25.530" end="00:46:28.770" style="s2">what I&#39;m really interested in the mixed</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.300" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">reality technologies where we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.770" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">away with this constant sitting and</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.500" end="00:46:59.850" style="s2">Brandon&#39;s question yeah thanks thanks</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.340" end="00:47:01.020" style="s2">cows have been fascinating my question</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.850" end="00:47:02.940" style="s2">is just what is the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.020" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">double consciousness and empathic past</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.940" end="00:47:07.530" style="s2">do you think there&#39;s a lot of overlap</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:10.650" style="s2">for me at least let&#39;s say that I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.530" end="00:47:15.090" style="s2">implement empathic capacity being an</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.650" end="00:47:17.190" style="s2">empath yeah absolutely and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.090" end="00:47:18.540" style="s2">you know empathise have I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.190" end="00:47:20.790" style="s2">talked about virtual reality as an</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.540" end="00:47:23.630" style="s2">empathy engine in the early days and I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.790" end="00:47:26.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s been pretty discredited now</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.630" end="00:47:29.220" style="s2">and for me it&#39;s it&#39;s about compassion a</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.850" end="00:47:32.970" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s a book coming the author</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.220" end="00:47:35.010" style="s2">against empathy and because you know a</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.970" end="00:47:37.260" style="s2">lot of the time if you&#39;re empathizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.010" end="00:47:40.650" style="s2">with somebody without the compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.260" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of it can be destabilizing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.650" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">you can actually be in the same state</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:49.020" style="s2">and not able to help them if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">you&#39;re you know without the compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.020" end="00:47:55.380" style="s2">so for me absolutely you know if we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:57.810" style="s2">in it with prisoners of our own selves</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.380" end="00:48:01.560" style="s2">and I think anything that enables us to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.810" end="00:48:03.750" style="s2">have the felt experience of another you</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.560" end="00:48:05.540" style="s2">know I&#39;m super interested in you know</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.890" end="00:51:17.570" style="s2">dimension where I which I would classed</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.890" end="00:51:20.390" style="s2">as a fifth dimensional realm where I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:51:56.150" end="00:52:01.099" style="s2">pluralistic way of seeing where I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.300" end="00:52:02.869" style="s2">not just in the in the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.099" end="00:52:04.720" style="s2">everyone goes on about and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.869" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">about being in the moment I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.720" end="00:52:10.339" style="s2">absolutely but also be all of those</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:12.520" style="s2">selves at the same time and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.339" end="00:52:15.800" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t take much to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.520" end="00:52:18.890" style="s2">access that plurality it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.800" end="00:52:21.950" style="s2">practice it&#39;s something that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.890" end="00:52:23.390" style="s2">build up and oh yeah for me that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.950" end="00:52:24.890" style="s2">focused on the double constants but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.390" end="00:52:31.609" style="s2">want to write a whole paper on what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.890" end="00:52:35.790" style="s2">just asked for maybe I can still ask a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.609" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">quick question so</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.790" end="00:52:42.090" style="s2">like what came up is okay so these are</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:43.590" style="s2">not are they sometimes lasting effects</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.090" end="00:52:46.740" style="s2">or how long do they last because it</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.590" end="00:52:50.340" style="s2">isn&#39;t it is a practice and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.740" end="00:52:52.710" style="s2">training a muscle and the stronger than</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.340" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">muscle I guess they&#39;re the longer the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.710" end="00:52:57.610" style="s2">effects last but sometimes I guess</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:52:59.860" style="s2">depending on</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.610" end="00:53:02.890" style="s2">yeah whichever of the many experiences</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.860" end="00:53:05.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve participated in are there</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.890" end="00:53:09.550" style="s2">some that had a longer lasting effect</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.860" end="00:53:15.010" style="s2">than others yeah I mean I had now a body</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.550" end="00:53:17.050" style="s2">experience 27 and that for me was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.010" end="00:53:21.580" style="s2">beginning of all of this journey because</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.050" end="00:53:23.410" style="s2">I was I was basically you know I got</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.580" end="00:53:26.430" style="s2">completely sober walked into an empty</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.410" end="00:53:29.470" style="s2">room and went out body standing up and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.430" end="00:53:31.480" style="s2">went into a round where I was I felt</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.470" end="00:53:33.550" style="s2">like I was headed upwards when I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.480" end="00:53:36.340" style="s2">suddenly this ginormous beam of light</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.550" end="00:53:38.710" style="s2">like an imagined javelin of light and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.340" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2">was rotating in a wheel of light of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.710" end="00:53:43.510" style="s2">these beams and suddenly I could see</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:46.180" style="s2">eight other beams of light and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.510" end="00:53:49.080" style="s2">disembodied voice tells me you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.180" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">soul is inhabiting eight other bodies</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.080" end="00:53:55.810" style="s2">and you&#39;re only aware of one and and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:53:57.670" style="s2">voice also says look up because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.810" end="00:53:59.710" style="s2">this this wheel of light is only part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.670" end="00:54:03.570" style="s2">what you&#39;re in and before I could look</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.710" end="00:54:05.650" style="s2">up my friend who&#39;s downstairs basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.570" end="00:54:06.940" style="s2">he was calling my name and as he was</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.650" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">calling my name I was pulled out of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.940" end="00:54:11.850" style="s2">space and poured back into my body and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.900" style="s2">as I was being poured back in I was told</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.850" end="00:54:16.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not calm you&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.900" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">experience of being car for a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.150" end="00:54:24.370" style="s2">months and and second thing there is no</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:28.660" style="s2">death and the third thing was tell</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.370" end="00:54:31.090" style="s2">everybody and from that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.660" end="00:54:33.490" style="s2">permission almost you know because again</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.090" end="00:54:35.380" style="s2">no no drugs involved completely and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.490" end="00:54:38.440" style="s2">was standing up you know it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.380" end="00:54:41.410" style="s2">wild and I&#39;d never tried DMT and took me</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.440" end="00:54:44.830" style="s2">ten years to find it after that and even</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.410" end="00:54:47.980" style="s2">then nothing like DMT so completely wild</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.830" end="00:54:52.060" style="s2">and you know I found a book or the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.980" end="00:54:54.190" style="s2">knowledge but gnosis book and it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.060" end="00:54:56.170" style="s2">basically a diagram in this book that</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.190" end="00:54:59.080" style="s2">looked exactly like why I&#39;d experienced</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.170" end="00:55:02.530" style="s2">and that the figure was called the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.080" end="00:55:04.540" style="s2">programming station of all so I still</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.530" end="00:55:06.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t fully understand I understood</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.540" end="00:55:07.660" style="s2">but what what then that led me to and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.520" end="00:55:09.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve never practiced out-of-body</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.660" end="00:55:11.050" style="s2">experiences since that was a completely</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.340" end="00:55:13.030" style="s2">like a gift</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.050" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">what the super interesting is that when</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.030" end="00:55:21.520" style="s2">I had my life review that forty was this</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:23.110" style="s2">this this ability to leave my body</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.520" end="00:55:24.760" style="s2">inside that space and maybe I would</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.110" end="00:55:26.680" style="s2">never have even thought of doing that or</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.760" end="00:55:28.780" style="s2">felt that I could do that without having</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.680" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">the out-of-body experience previous so</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.780" end="00:55:33.100" style="s2">super interesting when we start to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.210" end="00:55:37.150" style="s2">our transform eights transformative</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.100" end="00:55:39.670" style="s2">experiences as material for our own</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.150" end="00:55:41.290" style="s2">development and and actually using those</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.670" end="00:55:43.180" style="s2">as much as I do because of you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.290" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">a computer scientist but I also like to</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.180" end="00:55:47.260" style="s2">talk about these experiences because so</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:49.150" style="s2">much of what you know it&#39;s so much of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.260" end="00:55:50.470" style="s2">people you know people don&#39;t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.150" end="00:55:53.230" style="s2">them and I think that it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.470" end="00:55:55.600" style="s2">vital that we we consider that these</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.230" end="00:56:02.050" style="s2">felt experiences as just as important as</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.600" end="00:56:04.300" style="s2">anything cognitively we&#39;re nearing the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.050" end="00:56:06.100" style="s2">end of the session but perhaps we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.300" end="00:56:07.810" style="s2">still squeeze in one more question what</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.100" end="00:56:10.120" style="s2">do you think Carl yeah go ahead</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.850" end="00:56:26.470" style="s2">thankful to be able to create these</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.340" end="00:56:29.980" style="s2">notes in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.470" end="00:56:33.190" style="s2">so my question I&#39;ll just read it from</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.980" end="00:56:34.860" style="s2">here because I was curious as to why you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.190" end="00:56:37.120" style="s2">put it in the words that you did um</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.860" end="00:56:40.510" style="s2">could you clarify your use of the term</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.120" end="00:56:41.980" style="s2">dark side and death literacy and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.510" end="00:56:46.350" style="s2">really appreciative of you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.980" end="00:56:49.690" style="s2">Oh like the well what you&#39;ve said and</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.350" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">the how you said it was the extender of</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.690" end="00:56:53.820" style="s2">boundaries into what was previously an</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.060" end="00:56:56.830" style="s2">enemy territory</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.820" end="00:57:00.100" style="s2">while focusing on like changing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.830" end="00:57:03.630" style="s2">proving ourselves I realize it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.100" end="00:57:03.630" style="s2">little clip a big question but thank you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.220" end="00:57:08.850" style="s2">are you unnamed</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.390" end="00:57:14.140" style="s2">you&#39;re a mutant</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.990" end="00:57:17.770" style="s2">yes sorry um yeah it&#39;s actually quite a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.140" end="00:57:20.620" style="s2">part of that was the the death literacy</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.770" end="00:57:22.900" style="s2">thing was yeah I think that if we around</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.620" end="00:57:24.050" style="s2">the mystery schools and this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.900" end="00:57:26.120" style="s2">about you</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.050" end="00:57:27.740" style="s2">going through a death experience much</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.120" end="00:57:28.850" style="s2">like what we are I mean you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.740" end="00:57:31.730" style="s2">definitely been through dark night of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.850" end="00:57:35.450" style="s2">the soul over the last three months and</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.730" end="00:57:39.470" style="s2">I think it&#39;s so refreshing and vital to</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.450" end="00:57:41.840" style="s2">to basically face your mortality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.470" end="00:57:43.460" style="s2">I know friends of mine will believe</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.840" end="00:57:45.230" style="s2">they&#39;re immortal you know a certain age</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.460" end="00:57:47.660" style="s2">you you just do you just don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.230" end="00:57:49.940" style="s2">get it and so they go and work in</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.660" end="00:57:52.820" style="s2">nursing homes in order to get that death</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.940" end="00:57:54.920" style="s2">literacy and to you know to try and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.820" end="00:57:57.320" style="s2">counter this this feeling of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.920" end="00:57:58.370" style="s2">and endless time and I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.320" end="00:58:00.200" style="s2">why the mystery schools and these</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.370" end="00:58:05.000" style="s2">initiations are so important is because</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.200" end="00:58:07.100" style="s2">you get on with what&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.000" end="00:58:09.980" style="s2">in your life you know you don&#39;t mess</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.100" end="00:58:12.710" style="s2">around anymore you stop acting like and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.980" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">I do believe we are immortal but not in</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.710" end="00:58:17.150" style="s2">these bodies so I think that get on with</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:19.250" style="s2">your mission whatever it is if your</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.150" end="00:58:22.550" style="s2">mission is just a play then get on with</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.250" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">that but the point is is is yeah having</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.550" end="00:58:26.420" style="s2">having an awareness and the bit about</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.070" end="00:58:29.720" style="s2">the dark side and all that that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.420" end="00:58:32.230" style="s2">me that was Grant Morrison yeah where</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.720" end="00:58:35.240" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about basically becoming</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.230" end="00:58:36.410" style="s2">you know treat your friends close and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.240" end="00:58:39.380" style="s2">your enemies closer</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.410" end="00:58:41.510" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s all material where you</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.380" end="00:58:45.170" style="s2">know we&#39;re in this non duality but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.510" end="00:58:46.700" style="s2">also in a in a multiverse of infinite</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.170" end="00:58:49.550" style="s2">consciousness and it for me it&#39;s all</p>
