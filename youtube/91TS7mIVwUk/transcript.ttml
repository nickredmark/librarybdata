<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">different tonight so in the religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:29.610" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion structure channel</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">a bunch of our members have been working</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.610" end="00:01:34.259" style="s2">very hard on a document where they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">been putting together basically a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.259" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">proposed you know ideas for a proposed</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">structure developing the ideas for a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">structure of the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.210" style="s2">religion and I sent it to John last week</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">and he&#39;s had a chance to look it over</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.210" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">and and so we like to start off by</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:54.149" style="s2">chatting about that that for a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">bit and I think some of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.149" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">have been working on that are here I see</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">on tulip I&#39;m sorry I never know how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">pronounce your name on Telestial this</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:06.979" style="s2">here chef Ronnie is here the philistines</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:09.929" style="s2">worked on it Strong&#39;s worked on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.979" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">started if I&#39;ve missed missed anyone but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.929" end="00:02:13.670" style="s2">a lot of people have been working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">this document doing a fantastic job</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.670" end="00:02:18.500" style="s2">so so can I first say something about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">in general Brent yeah absolutely go</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.500" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">ahead alright so first of all I was very</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:27.650" style="s2">impressed by it I mentioned this to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.900" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">Brett already and of course I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.650" end="00:02:36.440" style="s2">continue to work on this project to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:38.600" style="s2">about it Chris but in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.440" end="00:02:41.300" style="s2">carefulness and the sophistication of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.600" end="00:02:46.730" style="s2">the thought that I&#39;ve seen here this</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.300" end="00:02:49.250" style="s2">actually it also in tracked it in acts</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.730" end="00:02:53.600" style="s2">and exemplify something that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.250" end="00:02:56.090" style="s2">important to me because how can I put</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:03:00.110" style="s2">this I don&#39;t want this to be in my hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.090" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">I want to participate in your eyes to</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.110" end="00:03:05.380" style="s2">try and create apologies of practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">and theoretical function around it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.380" end="00:03:10.819" style="s2">this with you with with all of you this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">is taking on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.819" end="00:03:18.170" style="s2">beyond me and that is excellent because</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">that is exactly what it needs to be if</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.170" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">it&#39;s going to have any chance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:25.609" style="s2">viability this has got to move to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:27.859" style="s2">something that over which I do not</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.609" end="00:03:30.350" style="s2">exercising anything like ownership or</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.859" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">authorship I hope I get to always have</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.350" end="00:03:36.070" style="s2">important a participatory role but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:40.329" style="s2">fact that this is being taken up a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.070" end="00:03:45.260" style="s2">community in this vital and vibrant way</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.329" end="00:03:47.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really that for me it is what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.260" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">most impressive about this document</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.000" end="00:03:51.140" style="s2">again not to take away from both its</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:53.810" style="s2">structure and its content which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.140" end="00:03:55.940" style="s2">excellent but but the actual performance</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.810" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">of this and what it&#39;s enacting and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.940" end="00:04:03.769" style="s2">exemplifying because I think what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:06.140" style="s2">most impressive to me about this thanks</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.769" end="00:04:08.540" style="s2">so much for that I I know some of some</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.140" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">of the people are here are there any</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.540" end="00:04:13.220" style="s2">questions that you guys want to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">with John about your document or draw</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.220" end="00:04:16.930" style="s2">attention to certain points to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.380" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2">yeah I think one question that I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.140" end="00:04:23.760" style="s2">for you John is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">do you think we&#39;re taking the right tack</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.760" end="00:04:28.780" style="s2">and kind of discussing it and breaking</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:29.770" style="s2">it down are we focusing on the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.780" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">things first</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.770" end="00:05:00.070" style="s2">or are we maybe jumping the gun on</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.240" end="00:05:01.900" style="s2">certain areas John I think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.070" end="00:05:21.610" style="s2">fan in the background that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.900" end="00:05:26.050" style="s2">making a bit of noise is Mihaly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.610" end="00:05:29.770" style="s2">muted but uh you fix the problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.050" end="00:05:32.350" style="s2">every I think it was another maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.770" end="00:05:38.950" style="s2">another member to so I think you&#39;re okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.350" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">go ahead okay so I would just put an</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.950" end="00:05:45.430" style="s2">additional thing I mean there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:48.640" style="s2">concretization the conditions the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.430" end="00:05:53.740" style="s2">propositions obviously and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.640" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">scaling it so and Retin are as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.740" end="00:05:59.020" style="s2">unending process is fantastic but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:02.890" style="s2">would I would welcome a category around</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.020" end="00:06:06.790" style="s2">something like the ongoing dialogue or</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.890" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">discourse or reciprocal reconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.790" end="00:06:12.310" style="s2">between but nar mag and science</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:14.350" style="s2">particularly cognitive science one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.310" end="00:06:16.330" style="s2">the things that I think that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">religion should be constantly because</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.330" end="00:06:20.350" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that it&#39;s an unending process</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:24.430" style="s2">its open-ended but I think it should</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.350" end="00:06:26.229" style="s2">always be responsive to what cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.430" end="00:06:28.660" style="s2">science is telling us about our meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.229" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">making machinery both within individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.660" end="00:06:31.150" style="s2">and distributed cognition so I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:33.940" style="s2">recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.150" end="00:06:37.030" style="s2">as an addendum to that to what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.940" end="00:06:41.260" style="s2">done so far what do you think of as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.030" end="00:06:45.040" style="s2">proposal I personally think it&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.260" end="00:06:47.729" style="s2">think there&#39;s been a lot of healthy</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.040" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">tension and conversation about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.729" end="00:06:53.229" style="s2">relationship with science I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:56.320" style="s2">probably spent an inordinate amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.229" end="00:06:59.530" style="s2">time talking about physics and all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.320" end="00:07:01.870" style="s2">fun philosophical stuff that gets you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.530" end="00:07:03.699" style="s2">into a rabbit hole but ultimately I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.870" end="00:07:06.340" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.699" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">makes a lot of sense kind of repairing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.340" end="00:07:10.530" style="s2">that relationship between the two or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.010" end="00:07:20.120" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.150" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">technologies and practices that was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.849" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">only thing that came to my mind as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:08:02.430" style="s2">lacuna that I thought needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:02.430" style="s2">addressed awesome it&#39;s great to hurt</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.670" style="s2">anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.630" end="00:08:09.230" style="s2">the Ritenour committee want to want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.670" end="00:08:21.110" style="s2">jump in before we get to the general</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.230" end="00:08:24.230" style="s2">questions I mean I have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.110" end="00:08:26.090" style="s2">with my time but I mean this project is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.230" end="00:08:27.560" style="s2">very good to me and again I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.090" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">don&#39;t want I&#39;m not trying to reclaim</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.560" end="00:08:32.600" style="s2">ownership and I definitely don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:36.740" style="s2">be doing anything like that so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.600" end="00:08:38.870" style="s2">saying is in what wage can I be of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.740" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">service to this project as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">especially since it is taking on a life</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:54.680" style="s2">talk to people and if feedback like</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:56.780" style="s2">whatever I can do to help I mean I will</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.680" end="00:09:01.130" style="s2">speak as a as a participant but I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.780" end="00:09:03.350" style="s2">that is very much appreciated I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.130" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">your your involvement in it is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.350" end="00:09:08.960" style="s2">that I think almost everyone wants I you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:11.180" style="s2">know again I don&#39;t think anyone would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.960" end="00:09:12.770" style="s2">concerned with you trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.180" end="00:09:15.410" style="s2">grab the reins or anything like that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.770" end="00:09:17.150" style="s2">think it&#39;s you know we respect you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.410" end="00:09:19.580" style="s2">your work and so your your input is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.150" end="00:09:21.470" style="s2">certainly something that we dig into</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.580" end="00:09:44.420" style="s2">heavy consideration or at least I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.470" end="00:09:47.510" style="s2">speak for myself I know I do to ask my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.420" end="00:09:49.460" style="s2">collaboration Postum i guess one</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.510" end="00:09:52.340" style="s2">question I&#39;ll ask is was there anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.460" end="00:09:56.830" style="s2">specific that the draft that Brett</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.340" end="00:10:01.550" style="s2">shared is there any kind of big</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.830" end="00:10:09.810" style="s2">takeaways or points of feedback that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.550" end="00:10:11.160" style="s2">have from what you&#39;ve seen so far so</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.810" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking about this with Tim</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.160" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">Bishop and this has been coming up too</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:19.350" style="s2">and I think again it&#39;s an addendum to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:21.390" style="s2">the scaling thing so I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.350" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">more and more about two things about</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.390" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2">scalability and sustainability and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:30.750" style="s2">would it take to make this not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:33.360" style="s2">scalable but sustainable I don&#39;t mean in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.750" end="00:10:36.150" style="s2">terms of an idea because ideas have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.360" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">certain sustainability but as you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.150" end="00:10:42.420" style="s2">as as a as a community of communities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:45.420" style="s2">practice so that&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.420" end="00:10:48.570" style="s2">it would be good if people started</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.420" end="00:10:54.300" style="s2">turning their attention to I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.570" end="00:10:59.760" style="s2">interested in the whole idea about how</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.300" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">this might not only move between sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.760" end="00:11:07.770" style="s2">layers of society etc of that but how I</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:11.279" style="s2">don&#39;t want it I don&#39;t want it to fall</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.770" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">into the pattern sorry this language is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.279" end="00:11:17.880" style="s2">something so pretentious I&#39;m really it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:19.260" style="s2">would be good if if this is succeeding</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.880" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">it would be good if it didn&#39;t fall prey</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.260" end="00:11:24.089" style="s2">to what happened with you know with cops</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:26.670" style="s2">work right you set up all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.089" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">secular churches and it was very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.670" end="00:11:33.720" style="s2">sort of popular during his lifetime and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">then they quickly faded away as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:40.260" style="s2">he was gone that&#39;s by the way why not</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:42.630" style="s2">having this time to me in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.260" end="00:11:44.310" style="s2">very very important to me so the issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.630" end="00:11:49.740" style="s2">of sustainability might be one you want</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.310" end="00:11:51.270" style="s2">to add to the Yale ability issue yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.740" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">think that&#39;s something that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.270" end="00:11:55.740" style="s2">had a lot of conversation about as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:57.959" style="s2">because it to your point it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.740" end="00:12:01.010" style="s2">matter of scale it&#39;s kind of persisting</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.959" end="00:12:03.089" style="s2">itself it&#39;s how do you keep it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.010" end="00:12:05.160" style="s2">continually evolving how do you make</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.089" end="00:12:08.370" style="s2">sure it&#39;s not static that it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.160" end="00:12:10.020" style="s2">retains that dynamic character in</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.370" end="00:12:13.170" style="s2">essence and I think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.020" end="00:12:15.330" style="s2">that it&#39;s a good point to call out that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:17.570" style="s2">that we should focus not just on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.330" end="00:12:20.430" style="s2">scale that also and kind of be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.570" end="00:12:21.540" style="s2">existence in perpetuity I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.430" end="00:12:24.780" style="s2">itself alive</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.540" end="00:12:27.630" style="s2">yeah so yeah micki making it as</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.780" end="00:12:31.170" style="s2">autopoietic as possible would be really</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.630" end="00:12:33.660" style="s2">really welcome anything yen I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.170" end="00:12:38.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve also raised welcome I have sorry</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.660" end="00:12:43.020" style="s2">I&#39;ve raised the concern that as Ratna</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.520" end="00:12:46.280" style="s2">grows we also need to put something in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.020" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">place you prevent degeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.280" end="00:12:53.090" style="s2">culture because as as it is now in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:55.980" style="s2">server we&#39;ve got a very good culture</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.090" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">operative and you know we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.980" end="00:13:03.690" style="s2">trying to you know we&#39;re all striving</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:05.730" style="s2">towards truth but I&#39;ve seen that come</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.690" end="00:13:08.910" style="s2">when communities grow too quickly for</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.730" end="00:13:13.380" style="s2">instance yeah they they kind of invite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.910" end="00:13:16.350" style="s2">load of like they don&#39;t acclimatize new</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.380" end="00:13:33.290" style="s2">members to the wholesome culture quick</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.350" end="00:13:37.380" style="s2">enough yeah which is you know Zack sign</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.290" end="00:13:39.060" style="s2">because the ideas about trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.380" end="00:13:42.420" style="s2">clearer understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.060" end="00:13:44.760" style="s2">relationship between a revised notion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.420" end="00:13:46.710" style="s2">Education and inculturation just what</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.760" end="00:13:50.730" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about so what would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.710" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">lead educational aspects of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.730" end="00:14:00.660" style="s2">community such that you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:14:03.450" style="s2">sustainable form of acculturation the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.660" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">standards that make the community such a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.450" end="00:14:08.100" style="s2">success right now I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.510" style="s2">important so and like I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.100" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">talking was back again but it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.510" end="00:14:14.970" style="s2">with a new exact but maybe you know even</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:17.370" style="s2">if he&#39;s not on voices with the baby for</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.970" end="00:14:20.850" style="s2">a while you might want to have him in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.370" end="00:14:23.340" style="s2">because um his ideas of my ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.850" end="00:14:25.290" style="s2">very convergent but he&#39;s also that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.340" end="00:14:29.190" style="s2">but a lot of part of the stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.290" end="00:14:30.990" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite as deeply about but his</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.190" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">idea of you know there&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.990" end="00:14:35.430" style="s2">education between two worlds I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.450" end="00:14:38.580" style="s2">might be very relevant to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.430" end="00:14:41.010" style="s2">very rather than oh yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.580" end="00:14:46.410" style="s2">definitely reach out to out to Zach to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.010" end="00:14:50.100" style="s2">see if it yeah see if he come on oh my</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.410" end="00:14:53.280" style="s2">gosh a wonderful wonderful person but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.100" end="00:14:54.510" style="s2">I mean I think that please don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.280" end="00:14:57.180" style="s2">misunderstand me I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.510" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">like a comprehensive answer to the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.180" end="00:15:00.090" style="s2">problem that was just brought up but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good place to start to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.090" end="00:15:06.660" style="s2">wrestle with it John I had a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:10.920" style="s2">question to this about scaling and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.660" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">degradation your lecture series really</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.920" end="00:15:16.830" style="s2">changed my life and I would tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.970" style="s2">everybody I knew about it and it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.830" end="00:15:20.580" style="s2">interesting hearing some of the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.970" end="00:15:22.440" style="s2">from some of my friends they come back</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.580" end="00:15:24.360" style="s2">and be like well if you like you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.440" end="00:15:26.310" style="s2">something significant it uses so many</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.360" end="00:15:29.460" style="s2">big words what is this perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.310" end="00:15:33.750" style="s2">this and then I would kind of try to put</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.460" end="00:15:37.550" style="s2">it in like kind of worse precision like</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.750" end="00:15:40.620" style="s2">kind of less signal words but people oh</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.550" end="00:15:42.900" style="s2">right yeah and so I&#39;m wondering just in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.620" end="00:15:45.480" style="s2">terms of scaling are there different</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.900" end="00:15:48.060" style="s2">roles in terms of the signal-to-noise</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.480" end="00:15:48.690" style="s2">the precision and could you maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.060" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">speak to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.690" end="00:15:53.160" style="s2">how important are the words and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:56.960" style="s2">quote unquote lies to children that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.160" end="00:15:56.960" style="s2">teachers use to get knowledge across</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.710" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">even in an advanced textbook on physics</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.290" end="00:16:09.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll see a diagram of the atom that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.470" end="00:16:12.360" style="s2">of course you know appreciably false</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.510" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">it&#39;s static it represents particles as</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.360" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">if they&#39;re little round spheres are</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:19.080" style="s2">definite locations all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:20.790" style="s2">that just turned out to be false but we</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.080" end="00:16:23.010" style="s2">can&#39;t do without these diagrams because</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.790" end="00:16:25.590" style="s2">we can&#39;t get people to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.010" end="00:16:29.850" style="s2">practice the physics without them I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.590" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a you know indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.850" end="00:16:34.620" style="s2">fictions that amplifier reality so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:37.410" style="s2">we can see patterns that we otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.620" end="00:16:39.330" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see I mean Plato did it first</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.410" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">with you know with the Republic and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.330" end="00:16:44.040" style="s2">belong you do this city you blow up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:45.390" style="s2">human psyche to the level of a city so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.040" end="00:16:47.640" style="s2">you might see things that you otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.390" end="00:16:49.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t see well I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:53.850" style="s2">comprehensive thing we first</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.230" end="00:16:56.400" style="s2">have acknowledged as part of at all</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.850" end="00:16:57.840" style="s2">levels children to adults we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.400" end="00:16:59.280" style="s2">this so there&#39;s more of a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.840" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">there so that that&#39;s the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.280" end="00:17:04.470" style="s2">would say secondly I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:06.510" style="s2">think about this and there&#39;s somebody I</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.470" end="00:17:09.170" style="s2">have a recording with him and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.510" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">to put it on poisons with her baby and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.170" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">this is this is Zeke&#39;s working now he</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.360" end="00:17:18.900" style="s2">took a bunch of mine I think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:21.090" style="s2">first 16 or 17 of the videos and he made</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.900" end="00:17:24.180" style="s2">15 minute animated versions of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.090" end="00:17:29.240" style="s2">arguments and I think they are massively</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.180" end="00:17:31.950" style="s2">successful it&#39;s on big animation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.240" end="00:17:33.390" style="s2">like I said I&#39;ll release the video in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.950" end="00:17:36.270" style="s2">bit and then perhaps you could also have</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.390" end="00:17:38.460" style="s2">EMR voices with verve a key because</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.270" end="00:17:40.710" style="s2">people that they can view that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.460" end="00:17:42.690" style="s2">really important I&#39;m also meeting with</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.710" end="00:17:44.310" style="s2">ethos Amanda because he approached me</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">and said I want to do a bunch of videos</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.310" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">with you we&#39;ve done five release one so</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:50.910" style="s2">far we&#39;ve done another what&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:55.230" style="s2">trying to make it simple without of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.910" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">course making it stupid so I hate this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.230" end="00:18:01.080" style="s2">project very seriously but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">think it&#39;s doable</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.080" end="00:18:05.370" style="s2">I think the work that Zeke did on think</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:08.670" style="s2">big animation have you seen any of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.370" end="00:18:10.310" style="s2">videos they&#39;re they&#39;re excellent and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.670" end="00:18:13.530" style="s2">think they&#39;re really really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.310" end="00:18:15.780" style="s2">taking you know they don&#39;t of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.530" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">they can&#39;t capture all of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.780" end="00:18:23.240" style="s2">but they get the core and then they</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:25.140" style="s2">present it in a multi like a multi</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.240" end="00:18:27.270" style="s2">excellency multi modal but that will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.140" end="00:18:29.340" style="s2">confusing that&#39;s a term from psychology</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.270" end="00:18:31.080" style="s2">it&#39;s both aphasia but there&#39;s a visual</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.340" end="00:18:33.180" style="s2">presentation as well as just a verbal</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.080" end="00:18:35.610" style="s2">presentation because it&#39;s animated that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.180" end="00:18:39.630" style="s2">really improves the intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.610" end="00:18:43.560" style="s2">the accessibility of it so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.630" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">there is first of all a way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.560" end="00:18:48.120" style="s2">philosophically grounding this in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.390" end="00:18:50.310" style="s2">work of people like Eldon and others you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.120" end="00:18:54.540" style="s2">know true like I said the book true or</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.310" end="00:18:59.100" style="s2">not and then linking that to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.540" end="00:19:02.300" style="s2">specific project of creating these these</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.100" end="00:19:04.670" style="s2">bridging forms and I take</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.300" end="00:19:07.070" style="s2">I take Zeke&#39;s work on think big</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.670" end="00:19:09.680" style="s2">animation as exemplary of how to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.070" end="00:19:17.780" style="s2">exactly that have any of you seen it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.680" end="00:19:20.600" style="s2">they need the videos I I haven&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.780" end="00:19:23.780" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely something he yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.600" end="00:19:28.990" style="s2">did I think he went all the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.780" end="00:19:28.990" style="s2">Agustin in connection in the series</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.110" end="00:19:36.920" style="s2">excellent alright so we have some</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.850" end="00:19:48.130" style="s2">questions queued up so helix and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.920" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">have a question he likes you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.130" end="00:19:54.410" style="s2">okay all right now so if religio is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:57.050" style="s2">the spirituality of religion where is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.410" end="00:19:59.420" style="s2">the spirituality in religion and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.050" end="00:20:09.610" style="s2">else is there besides spirituality in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.420" end="00:20:15.530" style="s2">religion is the way in which you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.610" end="00:20:18.410" style="s2">rituals for accessing and activating and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.530" end="00:20:33.260" style="s2">accentuating the jail and celebrating</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:35.030" style="s2">that hello sorry my computer was having</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.260" end="00:20:36.680" style="s2">a bit of technical difficulty I actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.030" end="00:20:39.770" style="s2">missed it did you start asking my</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.680" end="00:20:41.690" style="s2">question I did but but did you if you</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:49.430" style="s2">thank you thank you so much but before I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.730" end="00:20:51.790" style="s2">get to my question John I briefly met</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.430" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">you in Kingston Ontario and you were</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.790" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2">wondering about the state of your tenure</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:57.050" style="s2">and I heard that you actually got it so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">I just really wanted to congratulate you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.050" end="00:21:05.420" style="s2">on that that&#39;s really special that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:07.130" style="s2">got then the screening room I I went up</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.420" end="00:21:08.510" style="s2">to and you were sitting alone I shook</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.130" end="00:21:10.760" style="s2">your hand I tried to get as many</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.510" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">questions as I could at you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.760" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">that was a lot of fun that day we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.570" style="s2">doing another one in denim clothes</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:20.310" style="s2">Tobin struck but maybe we&#39;ll do another</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.570" end="00:21:27.300" style="s2">one at some point anyway would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.310" end="00:21:30.090" style="s2">awesome yes okay so a few of us were</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.300" end="00:21:32.130" style="s2">talking about religio last night and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:33.810" style="s2">was feeling a bit confused about it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.130" end="00:21:35.070" style="s2">so we we kind of came to somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.810" end="00:21:37.680" style="s2">conclusion I just wanted to hear your</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.070" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">thoughts on it so if religio is like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.680" end="00:21:41.970" style="s2">spirituality of religion where is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.710" style="s2">spirituality and religion specifically</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.970" end="00:22:01.410" style="s2">and what else would there be besides</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.710" end="00:22:05.550" style="s2">spirituality in religion yes so I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.410" end="00:22:09.240" style="s2">that the spirituality in religion is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.550" end="00:22:12.900" style="s2">know the set the set the set of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.240" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">practices that are designed to access</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.900" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">activate accentuate and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:22.170" style="s2">religio both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:24.750" style="s2">collectively and I think that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.170" end="00:22:29.090" style="s2">spirituality tends to point more towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.750" end="00:22:31.080" style="s2">an individual individual cognition</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">religion tends to point more towards</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.080" end="00:22:36.390" style="s2">distributed cognition and what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:37.020" style="s2">layman calls overflow and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.390" end="00:22:42.360" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.020" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">I think spirituality also I notice that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.360" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">I&#39;m putting them on a continuum right I</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:49.650" style="s2">think this virtuality puts more of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:53.670" style="s2">emphasis on the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.650" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">and it tends to put more of an emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.670" end="00:23:01.860" style="s2">on the cultivation of worship that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:05.330" style="s2">idea that people are getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.860" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">right relationship of proper reverence</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.330" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">towards what is ultimate and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:12.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be supernatural there</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:16.260" style="s2">are religions that don&#39;t have a super</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">naturalistic element in them and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.260" end="00:23:23.610" style="s2">religion also that&#39;s a lot more work</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:27.030" style="s2">than spirituality does in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.610" end="00:23:31.830" style="s2">the problems of scalability and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.030" end="00:23:33.990" style="s2">sustainability and in order to do that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.830" end="00:23:39.720" style="s2">think religion does a lot more work on</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.990" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">creating you know pictures and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.720" end="00:23:43.160" style="s2">propositions that are supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.430" end="00:23:52.110" style="s2">constrained individual spirituality so</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.070" end="00:24:00.600" style="s2">that the group spirituality is all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.110" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">always available I&#39;m still scratching my</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.600" end="00:24:04.020" style="s2">head on what religio is even though that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:05.610" style="s2">was a beautiful demonstration of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:08.750" style="s2">the difference between spirituality and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.610" end="00:24:08.750" style="s2">religionists Oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.860" end="00:24:18.690" style="s2">intended to designate the no</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:20.820" style="s2">spirituality or spiritual practices</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.690" end="00:24:23.850" style="s2">religion religio is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.820" end="00:24:26.490" style="s2">designate the sense of connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.850" end="00:24:30.090" style="s2">that relevance realization affords us</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.490" end="00:24:31.740" style="s2">the way the agent in the arena of belong</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.090" end="00:24:34.440" style="s2">together and generate affordances</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.740" end="00:24:36.690" style="s2">generate participatory now knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.440" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">grounds respect title knowing and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.690" end="00:24:44.100" style="s2">fact that that for adaptive reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:46.920" style="s2">sense of connectedness comes with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.100" end="00:24:49.470" style="s2">comes with very powerful effective and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.920" end="00:24:51.990" style="s2">motivational processes attached to it we</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.470" end="00:24:54.780" style="s2">seek out connectedness and we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.990" end="00:24:57.930" style="s2">distressed when we lose the conductive</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.780" end="00:24:59.940" style="s2">mist and so the religio over the Latin</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.930" end="00:25:01.590" style="s2">word religio originally means to bind</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.940" end="00:25:03.650" style="s2">things together to connect things</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.590" end="00:25:08.370" style="s2">together but I&#39;d show in the word</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.650" end="00:25:12.900" style="s2">precisely because I think what is exact</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.370" end="00:25:15.240" style="s2">it and appreciated in all the senses of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.900" end="00:25:16.890" style="s2">the word appreciated on all the work on</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.240" end="00:25:19.590" style="s2">senses the word appreciation what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.890" end="00:25:23.070" style="s2">exactly and appreciated in religion and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.590" end="00:25:27.210" style="s2">even in spirituality is religio I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.070" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">when we are trying to use individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.210" end="00:25:32.310" style="s2">practices of transformation and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom to enhance religio</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.310" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">that spirituality when we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:37.110" style="s2">plus the other things that I said go</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:39.690" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.110" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">mijin I think that&#39;s what religion is so</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.690" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">I don&#39;t think of religion itself as</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.150" end="00:25:52.890" style="s2">spirituality I think when we use mythos</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:54.990" style="s2">rituals stories sets of practices so</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.890" end="00:25:57.570" style="s2">that we could pursue religio for its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.990" end="00:26:00.780" style="s2">sake rather than extra mentally for our</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.570" end="00:26:05.220" style="s2">cognitive agency survival so the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.780" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">I use is your capacity for hearing sound</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.220" end="00:26:09.900" style="s2">to being connected to Sal that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:12.030" style="s2">religio music is spirituality music is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.900" end="00:26:15.240" style="s2">playing with the machinery by which you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.030" end="00:26:17.700" style="s2">are connected to the sound making it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.240" end="00:26:20.520" style="s2">intelligible all right so you have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.700" end="00:26:22.440" style="s2">of adaptive advantage the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.520" end="00:26:25.380" style="s2">which you can make sounds intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.440" end="00:26:27.030" style="s2">to you and connect via sound to your</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.380" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">environment and so you have all this</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.030" end="00:26:32.160" style="s2">machinery for making your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.030" style="s2">hear work very well but sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.160" end="00:26:38.190" style="s2">step apart from that and you go you play</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.030" end="00:26:40.380" style="s2">with the machinery of hearing and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.190" end="00:26:42.900" style="s2">listen to music if you play with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.380" end="00:26:44.280" style="s2">machinery of hearing and salience and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.900" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.280" end="00:26:49.260" style="s2">precisely because it&#39;s intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:52.710" style="s2">valuable to you because it carries with</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.260" end="00:26:56.549" style="s2">all all of this motivational and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.710" end="00:27:00.570" style="s2">effective power so if you know if sound</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.549" end="00:27:03.150" style="s2">you know the ability to hear is religio</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:05.760" style="s2">as in the analogy but the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.150" end="00:27:07.530" style="s2">listen to music is spirituality and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.750" style="s2">the ability to do it with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.530" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">people make music together would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.750" end="00:27:16.380" style="s2">religion how&#39;s that but that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.740" end="00:27:19.860" style="s2">good and I just want to concretize to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.380" end="00:27:23.250" style="s2">see if I understand it to use technology</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.860" end="00:27:27.299" style="s2">as an example if religio is the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.250" end="00:27:28.650" style="s2">connectedness or how to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.299" end="00:27:30.570" style="s2">technology then be a form of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.650" end="00:27:32.970" style="s2">spirituality because it&#39;s a mechanism to</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.570" end="00:27:45.059" style="s2">connect or with technology be a form of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.970" end="00:27:48.809" style="s2">religio I think when we&#39;re doing things</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.059" end="00:27:49.810" style="s2">like this when we turn right when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.809" end="00:27:52.030" style="s2">enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.810" end="00:27:53.920" style="s2">the technology to enhance the religio</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.030" end="00:27:55.930" style="s2">for its own sake it&#39;s celebrating it the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.920" end="00:27:59.130" style="s2">way we&#39;re doing here I think now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.930" end="00:28:06.190" style="s2">started to move into spirituality hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.130" end="00:28:07.330" style="s2">thank you that was great in John 3 is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.190" end="00:28:10.210" style="s2">possible that you get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.330" end="00:28:11.530" style="s2">closer to your mic it&#39;s just yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.210" end="00:28:13.950" style="s2">sounding a little distant</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.530" end="00:28:16.150" style="s2">I think what&#39;s doing that is this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.950" end="00:28:18.640" style="s2">yes that&#39;s better thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.150" end="00:28:25.570" style="s2">so tell me you but you know the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.640" end="00:28:27.490" style="s2">kill me I&#39;m kill me I&#39;m kind of new to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:33.220" style="s2">your work John but I must have Kelly</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.490" end="00:28:35.260" style="s2">Meyers on YouTube just I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.220" end="00:28:38.290" style="s2">grateful for your work of course and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.260" end="00:28:41.620" style="s2">see this discovery of your community in</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.290" end="00:28:43.660" style="s2">your work as sort of like a mile marker</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.620" end="00:28:47.490" style="s2">on the path that I&#39;ve been on so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.660" end="00:28:50.410" style="s2">pretty happy to be diving in but um</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.490" end="00:28:52.360" style="s2">I wonder thank you I wanted to thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.410" end="00:28:56.830" style="s2">for the questions you&#39;ve been Kelley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.360" end="00:28:58.510" style="s2">been in the Sangha for the morning</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.830" end="00:29:00.520" style="s2">classes of meditation and contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.510" end="00:29:02.350" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.520" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">to thank you your questions are often I</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.350" end="00:29:06.820" style="s2">think very valuable to the rest of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:08.020" style="s2">valuable to me but I get a very clear</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.820" end="00:29:11.830" style="s2">sense that they&#39;re valuable to other</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.020" end="00:29:13.990" style="s2">people who are attending the session so</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.830" end="00:29:15.460" style="s2">thank you very much for that oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.990" end="00:29:16.900" style="s2">welcome and thank you for taking</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.460" end="00:29:18.850" style="s2">questions I think that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.900" end="00:29:22.780" style="s2">for building the community so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.850" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">definitely mutually appreciated I guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.780" end="00:29:26.170" style="s2">I typed my question out so I guess I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:28.330" style="s2">read it but just to preface that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.170" end="00:29:31.960" style="s2">has kind of been churning in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.330" end="00:29:33.990" style="s2">from a lot of the ideas from people like</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.960" end="00:29:37.270" style="s2">for example Brett Weinstein has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.990" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2">making me think about these things so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.270" end="00:29:40.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve already discussed</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:42.820" style="s2">it somewhere but I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.210" end="00:29:46.150" style="s2">about the idea of leadership yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.820" end="00:29:48.520" style="s2">so my question is how you see leadership</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.150" end="00:29:50.350" style="s2">fitting within the framework and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.520" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">observations in awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.350" end="00:29:54.790" style="s2">meeting crisis and and your other</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.970" end="00:29:57.160" style="s2">discussions so I&#39;m thinking that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.790" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">process of reciprocal opening would be</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.160" end="00:30:02.100" style="s2">like contributing to the skills you need</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.399" style="s2">for leadership but I&#39;m also wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.100" end="00:30:05.469" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.399" end="00:30:07.659" style="s2">assesses associated with the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.469" end="00:30:09.789" style="s2">crisis itself is is perhaps like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.659" end="00:30:13.089" style="s2">driver of poor leadership and lack of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.789" end="00:30:16.989" style="s2">leadership in our societies and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.089" end="00:30:19.960" style="s2">as an example I feel like I&#39;m not like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.989" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">leader so to speak but now I with your</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.960" end="00:30:24.609" style="s2">ideas it occurred to me that that might</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:28.029" style="s2">be my way I&#39;m interacting with the world</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.609" end="00:30:30.039" style="s2">is just not giving me its narrowing me</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.029" end="00:30:33.129" style="s2">into where I can&#39;t be a leader I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.039" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">see my ideas as being worth having</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.129" end="00:30:37.599" style="s2">confidence in I guess so maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:39.009" style="s2">just sort of speak about that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.599" end="00:30:40.450" style="s2">starting with like a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.009" end="00:30:42.429" style="s2">leadership because I really don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.450" end="00:30:46.299" style="s2">that I have a firm grasp on really what</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.429" end="00:30:50.200" style="s2">it is and like a scientific sense so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.299" end="00:30:52.589" style="s2">mean so I&#39;m crystal that&#39;s a fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.200" end="00:30:52.589" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.619" end="00:30:58.479" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a question that</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.409" end="00:31:00.460" style="s2">unfortunately I haven&#39;t put as much time</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.479" end="00:31:02.469" style="s2">into in order to give you a deep answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.460" end="00:31:04.330" style="s2">the question is deep and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.469" end="00:31:07.509" style="s2">what I&#39;m what I want to do is indicate</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.330" end="00:31:09.369" style="s2">first of all my ignorance because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.509" end="00:31:12.759" style="s2">lack of work because I have concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.369" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">on something that is close enough to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.759" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">that that it takes my attention which</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:18.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve been concentrating a lot on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:22.589" style="s2">question of what it is to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.700" end="00:31:25.029" style="s2">teacher because I&#39;m a teacher and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.589" end="00:31:26.919" style="s2">therefore that has taken out when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.029" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">what I&#39;m sort of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.919" end="00:31:31.299" style="s2">relationship I tend to and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:34.119" style="s2">this is correct</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.299" end="00:31:35.019" style="s2">so I&#39;m admitting a mistake I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.119" end="00:31:36.729" style="s2">assimilate</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.019" end="00:31:39.429" style="s2">I think unconsciously the question of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.729" end="00:31:42.580" style="s2">leadership to the question of mentorship</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.429" end="00:31:45.969" style="s2">and the question of pedagogy and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.580" end="00:31:48.940" style="s2">a mistake so this is something I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.969" end="00:31:50.710" style="s2">to put more thought into I have put some</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.940" end="00:31:55.029" style="s2">thought into it but only in a negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.710" end="00:32:00.729" style="s2">fashion in that I&#39;m very concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.029" end="00:32:02.409" style="s2">the way in which all of us I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.729" end="00:32:03.639" style="s2">community I don&#39;t I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.409" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">trying to be presumptuous I mean I the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.639" end="00:32:08.529" style="s2">people I&#39;m talking to like Jordan and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:12.190" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a model here that Weber</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.529" end="00:32:14.739" style="s2">would call a charismatic leadership and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.190" end="00:32:17.140" style="s2">the thing about that is that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.739" end="00:32:18.910" style="s2">fit naturally with</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.140" end="00:32:20.980" style="s2">the kinds of communities where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.910" end="00:32:24.420" style="s2">really emphasizing emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.980" end="00:32:27.850" style="s2">innovation and transformational and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.420" end="00:32:31.960" style="s2">charismatic leadership right it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.850" end="00:32:34.510" style="s2">emphasized a lot by Weber so charisma is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.960" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">basically and this is coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.510" end="00:32:37.720" style="s2">discussion I&#39;m having with Jennifer</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">stellar and some of the people on are a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.720" end="00:32:45.280" style="s2">charismatic leader has the capacity I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:47.740" style="s2">would say to introduce something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.280" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">awe or wonder into people but also</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.740" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">resolve it for them so that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:54.070" style="s2">slip into horror or a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:57.669" style="s2">disconnection or a sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.070" end="00:33:01.500" style="s2">overwhelmed and and so they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.669" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">trigger a kind of reverence because</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.500" end="00:33:07.690" style="s2">reverence is the virtue for responding</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:11.290" style="s2">to I would argue and and and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:14.890" style="s2">I think so charismatic leadership is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.290" end="00:33:16.679" style="s2">closely associated with communities</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.890" end="00:33:19.720" style="s2">where emergence and innovation are</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.679" end="00:33:21.970" style="s2">emphasized precisely because that form</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.720" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">of leadership puts a hype it gets its</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.970" end="00:33:27.490" style="s2">existence out of inducing wonder and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:29.559" style="s2">insight and transformation in people so</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.490" end="00:33:32.910" style="s2">that makes sense to me but the issue</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.559" end="00:33:35.530" style="s2">that I have typically is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.910" end="00:33:39.429" style="s2">charismatic leadership is also the one</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.530" end="00:33:43.990" style="s2">that has the greatest potential to feed</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.429" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">into narcissism to feed into a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.990" end="00:33:48.700" style="s2">dangerous four versions of popular</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">populism and things like that so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.700" end="00:33:52.270" style="s2">sorry Kelly I know this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:54.580" style="s2">complete answer I&#39;m just and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.270" end="00:33:56.380" style="s2">already told you I put in adequate work</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.580" end="00:33:58.030" style="s2">in and I made note I&#39;m trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.380" end="00:34:01.540" style="s2">you the all I&#39;m doing is showing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.030" end="00:34:05.340" style="s2">where I have put thought in and so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.540" end="00:34:07.560" style="s2">the the alternative to the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.340" end="00:34:11.070" style="s2">charismatic leadership of course is</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.560" end="00:34:14.530" style="s2">institutional leadership where people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.070" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">have authority to lead because of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.530" end="00:34:18.669" style="s2">office that they have achieved through</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:22.270" style="s2">some kind of meritocracy whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.669" end="00:34:25.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a real meritocracy or are just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.270" end="00:34:27.609" style="s2">sham one but whatever now the advantages</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.750" end="00:34:31.300" style="s2">of institutional leadership is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.609" end="00:34:33.580" style="s2">it&#39;s very it&#39;s it&#39;s much harder</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.300" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">for it to go off the rails into sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.580" end="00:34:38.800" style="s2">a cult-like thing but the disadvantages</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:41.770" style="s2">of institutional leadership is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.800" end="00:34:44.859" style="s2">that we lose an orientation towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.770" end="00:34:46.750" style="s2">emergence and innovation and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.859" end="00:34:50.919" style="s2">trying to understand is there a way in</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.750" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">which we could get what I saw with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.919" end="00:34:54.520" style="s2">scientists who are doing the work with</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:56.200" style="s2">the Rovers on Mars and I&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.520" end="00:34:57.129" style="s2">this in a couple of my talks and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.200" end="00:34:59.500" style="s2">some of the work I&#39;m doing with in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.129" end="00:35:01.510" style="s2">chianti they have this style of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:04.210" style="s2">leadership in which there&#39;s a constantly</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.510" end="00:35:07.510" style="s2">shifting form of leadership and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.210" end="00:35:11.250" style="s2">constantly shifting between expertise</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.510" end="00:35:14.410" style="s2">and something like a charismatic style</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.250" end="00:35:17.800" style="s2">like is there a way in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.410" end="00:35:20.260" style="s2">create a dynamic small world network</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.800" end="00:35:22.330" style="s2">organization of people in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.260" end="00:35:23.800" style="s2">sort of get the best or split the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.330" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">difference between institutional</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.800" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">leadership and charismatic leadership</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:29.830" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a question that&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:34.150" style="s2">mind because it&#39;s I think it&#39;s integral</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.830" end="00:35:36.790" style="s2">to trying to prevent a lot of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.150" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">working on here together from going off</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.790" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">in some very dangerous directions with</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:48.940" style="s2">and again we are we have to we all me</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:54.130" style="s2">and we also be careful of it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.940" end="00:35:56.530" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re in situations of you know an</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.130" end="00:35:59.560" style="s2">emphasis on emergence and innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.530" end="00:36:02.680" style="s2">transformation and you know there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.560" end="00:36:04.990" style="s2">and we are I think rightfully so</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.680" end="00:36:06.550" style="s2">appreciative of charismatic individuals</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.990" end="00:36:08.530" style="s2">who are sources of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.550" end="00:36:13.420" style="s2">innovation you have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.530" end="00:36:16.600" style="s2">about the dangers of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.420" end="00:36:20.500" style="s2">inflation hubris and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.600" end="00:36:23.800" style="s2">the degeneration into a cult but I also</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.500" end="00:36:25.750" style="s2">don&#39;t want to just go and say well then</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.800" end="00:36:27.310" style="s2">we have to go into institutional</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.750" end="00:36:28.450" style="s2">leadership because that&#39;s got us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.310" end="00:36:30.730" style="s2">of the problems that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.450" end="00:36:33.220" style="s2">break out of so sorry that was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.730" end="00:36:36.670" style="s2">rambling but as I said my thought and</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.220" end="00:36:38.770" style="s2">this is very immature and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.670" end="00:36:42.060" style="s2">trying to give you what what thought I</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.770" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">have had about leadership right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.060" end="00:36:47.740" style="s2">well that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:50.410" style="s2">I mean trysting idea is that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.740" end="00:36:52.990" style="s2">think it actually clarifies one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.410" end="00:36:54.660" style="s2">that I was referring to with what brett</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.990" end="00:36:57.930" style="s2">weinstein talks about he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.660" end="00:37:00.280" style="s2">identified what i think is the same a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.930" end="00:37:02.830" style="s2">same trend that you&#39;re pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.280" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">india the concept of charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.830" end="00:37:08.230" style="s2">leadership he&#39;s identified that many</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:12.490" style="s2">would-be leaders are what he says are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.230" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">trapped in the gig economy and so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.490" end="00:37:16.750" style="s2">kind of feeds into that but i do wonder</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:19.180" style="s2">because as a society we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.750" end="00:37:22.180" style="s2">institutions and so i wonder if i would</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.180" end="00:37:24.790" style="s2">encourage you to maybe still define that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.180" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">balance because like for instance anyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.790" end="00:37:29.140" style="s2">who joins the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:31.540" style="s2">religion maybe we would want them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.140" end="00:37:38.680" style="s2">transform into someone who could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.540" end="00:37:41.860" style="s2">suited to lead our society you know i I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.680" end="00:37:44.260" style="s2">was only I am oriented towards the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.860" end="00:37:46.300" style="s2">balance I think what Paul said about you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.260" end="00:37:49.030" style="s2">know individuals</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.300" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">innovate but institutions preserve right</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.030" end="00:37:57.370" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s very that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:59.320" style="s2">relevant I guess I guess I tended to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.370" end="00:38:01.630" style="s2">overemphasize the charismatic in my</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.320" end="00:38:06.040" style="s2">presentation to you because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.630" end="00:38:08.530" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my own self self</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.040" end="00:38:11.890" style="s2">reflection and self criticism I am</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.530" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">concerned about that about falling into</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.890" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">that myself and so I tend to give that a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:21.270" style="s2">lot more a little bit more priority in</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:27.930" style="s2">my thinking right now so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.270" end="00:38:27.930" style="s2">that&#39;s why all right next up is Jack</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.630" end="00:38:39.340" style="s2">hello my question is it can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.120" end="00:38:43.050" style="s2">overwhelming sometimes to have a chronic</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.340" end="00:38:46.860" style="s2">condition that is rather disabling and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.050" end="00:38:50.350" style="s2">disorienting and it can be hard to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.860" end="00:38:51.730" style="s2">softly communicate with maybe the part</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.350" end="00:38:55.060" style="s2">of our body where the chronic condition</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.730" end="00:38:56.530" style="s2">resides or to integrate communication</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.060" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">throughout the body you feel like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.530" end="00:39:00.380" style="s2">blockage and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:01.670" style="s2">I&#39;ll be able to have anger that results</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.380" end="00:39:04.370" style="s2">especially if you have a chronic</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.670" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">condition at a young age when your body</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.370" end="00:39:10.460" style="s2">is supposed to be spry and young and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">particularly when the chronic condition</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.460" end="00:39:15.050" style="s2">is flaring badly yeah it can be easy to</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:17.090" style="s2">garner a lot of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.050" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">if freaking out rather than doing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.090" end="00:39:24.020" style="s2">right thing which would be to go through</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:27.140" style="s2">it I was in mindfully so what are some</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.020" end="00:39:29.240" style="s2">techniques that we can apply okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.140" end="00:39:31.670" style="s2">can speak to this personally if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.240" end="00:39:33.110" style="s2">don&#39;t mind because I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.670" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">the kind of response that&#39;s needed here</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.290" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">get very powerful agoraphobia because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.230" end="00:40:33.830" style="s2">becomes very difficult for me to go</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:36.290" style="s2">outside because part of my brain is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.830" end="00:40:40.760" style="s2">trying to keep me inside where I&#39;m safe</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.290" end="00:40:44.350" style="s2">in case I get an attack and so I that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.760" end="00:40:49.700" style="s2">have to not only challenge the initial</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.350" end="00:40:52.700" style="s2">onset of an attack and the I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.700" end="00:40:54.770" style="s2">rather have an iPad and pain I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.700" end="00:40:57.110" style="s2">in a hospital and I was it looked like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.770" end="00:40:58.970" style="s2">like I was potentially going to die from</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.110" end="00:41:01.340" style="s2">an infection and I&#39;ve had intense pain I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.970" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">would take that over a Meniere&#39;s attack</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.340" end="00:41:06.530" style="s2">any day of the week and then so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:09.650" style="s2">only have to deal with that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.530" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">deal with the the very the very rapid</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:12.109" style="s2">way in which in conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.910" end="00:41:14.569" style="s2">agoraphobia</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.109" end="00:41:17.630" style="s2">to challenge that continually so and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.569" end="00:41:20.349" style="s2">then as you said this goes into my</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.630" end="00:41:23.209" style="s2">sitting every time I said there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.349" end="00:41:25.299" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of body armor in the left</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.209" end="00:41:27.769" style="s2">side of my head and my neck and my body</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.299" end="00:41:30.380" style="s2">because there&#39;s a part of me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.769" end="00:41:34.130" style="s2">always trying to be hyper vigilant for</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.380" end="00:41:36.940" style="s2">my my ear deal with the pain right so</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.130" end="00:41:38.269" style="s2">all of this is ongoing for me so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.940" end="00:41:40.729" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.269" end="00:41:42.190" style="s2">very very directly and clearly what</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.729" end="00:41:49.910" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.190" end="00:41:53.380" style="s2">so what that has meant for me is first</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.910" end="00:41:58.339" style="s2">of all I don&#39;t want to sound trite but</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.380" end="00:42:00.890" style="s2">when I get remission and I get times in</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.339" end="00:42:05.059" style="s2">which I&#39;m not as challenged by many</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.890" end="00:42:07.660" style="s2">years I think of those as the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.059" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">important times for my practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.660" end="00:42:15.650" style="s2">precisely because my practice won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:18.619" style="s2">as deep when the when I get a flare-up</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.650" end="00:42:24.769" style="s2">and then I try to adjust it accordingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.619" end="00:42:27.829" style="s2">I try to reduce so you know there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.769" end="00:42:29.479" style="s2">teach like a progression of skills in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.829" end="00:42:31.519" style="s2">the course on the mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.479" end="00:42:35.709" style="s2">and when I having a flare-up</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.519" end="00:42:39.019" style="s2">I don&#39;t pursue the deepest most profound</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.709" end="00:42:40.670" style="s2">practices I drop back down to the basic</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.019" end="00:42:43.999" style="s2">practices that I have practiced the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.670" end="00:42:48.369" style="s2">longer and therefore have have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.999" end="00:42:53.900" style="s2">stability to them I also practice with</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.369" end="00:42:57.829" style="s2">making my reaction in my body to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.900" end="00:43:00.739" style="s2">veneers not the veneers itself but my</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.829" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">reaction my embodied and in mind it the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.739" end="00:43:05.719" style="s2">way my mind is tense and tries to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:07.339" style="s2">that and the way my body is tense and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.719" end="00:43:09.170" style="s2">tries to control it all of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.339" end="00:43:10.759" style="s2">secondary reaction and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.170" end="00:43:14.049" style="s2">emotion around it like the attendant</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.759" end="00:43:16.219" style="s2">anxiety I sometimes will make that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.049" end="00:43:19.420" style="s2">especially when I&#39;m not in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.219" end="00:43:23.869" style="s2">an intense flare-up I will make that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.420" end="00:43:25.760" style="s2">object of my meditation and I will or I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.869" end="00:43:29.390" style="s2">will direct Metta towards it or</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.760" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">four passionate towards it and again not</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.390" end="00:43:35.840" style="s2">with the intent of curing it or making</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:37.970" style="s2">it go away the disease but realizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.840" end="00:43:40.130" style="s2">that the secondary reaction is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.970" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">over which I bear responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.130" end="00:43:45.920" style="s2">that I can learn to let go of and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.480" style="s2">oh I I can make a space again not for</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.920" end="00:43:50.150" style="s2">cure because what I have is not curable</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.480" end="00:43:52.700" style="s2">but I can make a space for more adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.150" end="00:43:55.880" style="s2">responses that are more consonant with</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.700" end="00:43:58.790" style="s2">my longitudinal ability to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.880" end="00:44:00.830" style="s2">practices I want to engage in what was</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.790" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">that at all helpful because I&#39;m deeply</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.830" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">sympathetic with what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:11.240" style="s2">about yes though is helpful do you want</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:12.470" style="s2">to follow up question because I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.240" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">take this what you&#39;re saying very</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.470" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">seriously I mean it&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:24.230" style="s2">agoraphobia part like it&#39;s hard to can</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.680" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">be hard to go out and they can get easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.230" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">to develop a lot of anxiety about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen yeah there is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.470" end="00:44:37.640" style="s2">mean if there&#39;s no access to help or</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:44.690" style="s2">something so I need part of what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.640" end="00:44:48.380" style="s2">tried to I tried to do is I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.690" end="00:44:50.390" style="s2">do imaginative exercise to say well what</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.380" end="00:44:55.690" style="s2">would happen if I like as I have had</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.390" end="00:45:00.710" style="s2">attacks when I&#39;m out and they&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.690" end="00:45:01.850" style="s2">so this it&#39;s human these are very bad at</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.710" end="00:45:04.820" style="s2">what&#39;s called affective forecasting</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.850" end="00:45:07.730" style="s2">we&#39;re very bad at actually predicting</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.820" end="00:45:10.370" style="s2">our effective response to situation and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.730" end="00:45:15.740" style="s2">what the circumstances will be in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.370" end="00:45:17.600" style="s2">situation and so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.740" end="00:45:19.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve tried to collect</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.600" end="00:45:22.670" style="s2">instances where I&#39;ve been out and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.790" end="00:45:27.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve had an attack like I try to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.670" end="00:45:29.660" style="s2">create them as memorials and as bad as</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.200" end="00:45:31.400" style="s2">they were that wasn&#39;t so bad like so</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.660" end="00:45:33.430" style="s2">when I started teaching here let me give</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.400" end="00:45:36.440" style="s2">you a concrete example when I started</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.430" end="00:45:38.570" style="s2">teaching the mindfulness class I was</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.440" end="00:45:39.500" style="s2">very worried about having a Meniere&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.570" end="00:45:40.790" style="s2">attack</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.500" end="00:45:42.140" style="s2">as I was teaching it because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.790" end="00:45:44.810" style="s2">that would be very disruptive and of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.140" end="00:45:47.990" style="s2">course I did have one and then I</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.810" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">realized no the what what rather than</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.990" end="00:45:54.020" style="s2">people sort of abandoning me when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:57.350" style="s2">shared it with him and I shared how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.020" end="00:45:59.570" style="s2">practice is helpful to me and how it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.350" end="00:46:01.370" style="s2">be a chronic illness can be integrated</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.570" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">with the practice I got a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.370" end="00:46:06.140" style="s2">amount of support that that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:08.630" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have another attack because I</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.140" end="00:46:11.270" style="s2">did but what it meant was all the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.630" end="00:46:13.850" style="s2">huge narrative that I built around the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.270" end="00:46:16.280" style="s2">narrative of rejection and the rejection</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.850" end="00:46:19.990" style="s2">and the narrative of failure I was able</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.280" end="00:46:27.770" style="s2">to address that pretty comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.990" end="00:46:28.760" style="s2">and so building up a you know because</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.770" end="00:46:30.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.760" end="00:46:32.780" style="s2">rumination you can&#39;t do it when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.500" end="00:46:35.480" style="s2">in rumination building up outside</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.780" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">illumination a record of where you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.480" end="00:46:39.920" style="s2">been outside and there his right either</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:41.570" style="s2">virtually or or literally and there has</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:46.010" style="s2">been an attack and you are nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.570" end="00:46:49.730" style="s2">right it hasn&#39;t been as terrifyingly bad</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.010" end="00:46:56.930" style="s2">as your fear makes it seem I have found</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.730" end="00:47:01.880" style="s2">that a very helpful technique right mark</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.930" end="00:47:05.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a question for John hello</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.880" end="00:47:07.340" style="s2">John good thank you again I / - staying</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.660" end="00:47:15.230" style="s2">that was nice hey it&#39;s great to hear</p>

<p begin="00:47:22.460" end="00:47:26.270" style="s2">some service there it&#39;s a lot of fun and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.140" end="00:47:28.610" style="s2">I really appreciate the lessons I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.270" end="00:47:31.220" style="s2">learning a lot and my question is</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.610" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">actually kind of about this so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.220" end="00:47:36.410" style="s2">two sort of core problems that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:39.740" style="s2">always had in terms of that I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.410" end="00:47:41.540" style="s2">seen with meditation one is engagement</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.740" end="00:47:43.880" style="s2">right it&#39;s hard to get people to agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.540" end="00:47:47.450" style="s2">to do it put in the work and spend the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.880" end="00:47:49.990" style="s2">time but even when they do that a large</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.450" end="00:47:51.950" style="s2">number of people seem to fail to get</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.990" end="00:47:53.450" style="s2">mostly what I&#39;m referring to is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.950" end="00:47:56.690" style="s2">second-order effects out of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.450" end="00:47:58.339" style="s2">um you know that the stuff you talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.690" end="00:48:00.440" style="s2">about around people see you and they</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.339" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">they ask you if something&#39;s changed</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.440" end="00:48:09.290" style="s2">about you sort of stuff and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:11.510" style="s2">broken this down into so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.290" end="00:48:13.220" style="s2">things I think mission bring you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.510" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">specifically is bringing you with</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.220" end="00:48:21.530" style="s2">perspectival flexibility yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:23.720" style="s2">just engagement right if you engage you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.530" end="00:48:27.950" style="s2">should get that just following the steps</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.720" end="00:48:31.220" style="s2">or following some method but then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:33.460" style="s2">other end of this is something I&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.220" end="00:48:36.890" style="s2">of playing with as an idea called</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.460" end="00:48:39.079" style="s2">engaging in continuous sampling and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.890" end="00:48:41.000" style="s2">engagement and continuous sampling would</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.079" end="00:48:43.940" style="s2">be something like the ability to do the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.000" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">integration of the meditation into your</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.940" end="00:48:49.579" style="s2">into the rest of your life ya know so</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:51.349" style="s2">this is more of a cog side question</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.579" end="00:48:52.820" style="s2">which is one reason why I didn&#39;t ask it</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.349" end="00:48:56.150" style="s2">in the meditation itself so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.820" end="00:48:59.180" style="s2">wondering if you have any answers in or</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.150" end="00:49:01.569" style="s2">pointers in terms of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.180" end="00:49:05.150" style="s2">facilitate the meditation experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.569" end="00:49:12.589" style="s2">integration more easily and make it more</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.150" end="00:49:14.150" style="s2">accessible for people technique is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.589" end="00:49:17.000" style="s2">technique that&#39;s being used in</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.150" end="00:49:21.770" style="s2">psychology and cognitive science as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.000" end="00:49:23.140" style="s2">way of trying to get that that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.770" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">transformation that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.140" end="00:49:32.859" style="s2">the second-order effects is I like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:36.740" style="s2">we call it naming them by the way so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.859" end="00:49:38.660" style="s2">mean so you know you&#39;re aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.740" end="00:49:40.579" style="s2">traditional thing the traditional thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.660" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">is you know the practice of the precepts</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.579" end="00:49:45.440" style="s2">and regularly practicing the integration</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:47.390" style="s2">as you come out of the practice and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.440" end="00:49:50.839" style="s2">the tradition also talks about you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.390" end="00:49:52.520" style="s2">creating the triggers specific</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.839" end="00:49:56.180" style="s2">situations putting things in your pocket</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.520" end="00:49:58.670" style="s2">or some people have timers that go off</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.180" end="00:50:00.460" style="s2">periodically and when that happens you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.670" end="00:50:04.670" style="s2">know you do the one or two breath</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.460" end="00:50:07.130" style="s2">meditation and you do their right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.670" end="00:50:09.470" style="s2">then you see which aspect</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.130" end="00:50:11.950" style="s2">of mindfulness could be applied in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.470" end="00:50:17.420" style="s2">situation and then you also do the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.950" end="00:50:21.140" style="s2">when you do spontaneously have insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.420" end="00:50:22.910" style="s2">or flexibility or somebody notes that in</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.140" end="00:50:25.789" style="s2">you you take a moment to write it down</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.910" end="00:50:29.029" style="s2">and note it down because relying on your</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.789" end="00:50:29.479" style="s2">memory is it won&#39;t work it won&#39;t work it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.029" end="00:50:31.640" style="s2">won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.479" end="00:50:37.150" style="s2">oh yeah I&#39;ll remember that New York very</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.640" end="00:50:39.799" style="s2">well so I think trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.150" end="00:50:42.799" style="s2">triggers throughout the day in</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.799" end="00:50:45.769" style="s2">conjunction with doing the integration</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.799" end="00:50:47.450" style="s2">practices that the promises and making</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.769" end="00:50:51.619" style="s2">the commitment on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:55.970" style="s2">especially in a state that bridges out</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.619" end="00:50:58.130" style="s2">of a seated or moving practice I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.970" end="00:51:00.920" style="s2">that having the ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.130" end="00:51:04.930" style="s2">especially having moving practices or</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.920" end="00:51:07.910" style="s2">trains the brain to apply mindfulness in</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.930" end="00:51:10.279" style="s2">interaction as opposed to just being</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.910" end="00:51:13.640" style="s2">inside an introspective space I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.279" end="00:51:15.829" style="s2">that&#39;s I know for me that the places</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.640" end="00:51:17.630" style="s2">where the transfers happen first were</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.829" end="00:51:20.029" style="s2">the places that were afforded by the Tai</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.630" end="00:51:24.769" style="s2">Chi Chuan rather than the Vipassana</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.029" end="00:51:28.039" style="s2">itself or the meta so I there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.769" end="00:51:29.210" style="s2">things we could do sorry there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.039" end="00:51:31.219" style="s2">of things that have been recommended by</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.210" end="00:51:33.999" style="s2">the tradition and I just imagined them</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.219" end="00:51:36.289" style="s2">to you I think with that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.999" end="00:51:40.579" style="s2">existing apps out there that are also</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.289" end="00:51:43.249" style="s2">designed to both sample people get them</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.579" end="00:51:48.549" style="s2">to quickly record and also to provoke</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.249" end="00:51:51.559" style="s2">them to do moments of integration so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.549" end="00:51:54.999" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s possible that we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.559" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">an ecology of practices we could also</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.999" end="00:52:02.799" style="s2">bootstrap a lot of the traditional ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.160" end="00:52:06.609" style="s2">of practicing integration and probably</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.799" end="00:52:06.609" style="s2">improve their efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.960" end="00:52:11.660" style="s2">all right strong</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.100" end="00:52:13.580" style="s2">sterling you&#39;re up you&#39;re up next and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.660" end="00:52:15.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve got I think three questions here</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.580" end="00:52:17.980" style="s2">but we&#39;re running quickly low on time so</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.860" end="00:52:21.560" style="s2">could you please just stick to one</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.980" end="00:52:24.920" style="s2">they&#39;re all connected those I think John</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.560" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">can answer them together but I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.920" end="00:52:28.430" style="s2">ask about suchness and mones within the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:31.190" style="s2">context of engineering symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.430" end="00:52:33.020" style="s2">sufficiency so the three that I went to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.190" end="00:52:35.450" style="s2">the connectors is such nice two</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.020" end="00:52:38.900" style="s2">thickness as mones is to nothingness and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.450" end="00:52:41.090" style="s2">then does such nurse speak to the parts</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.900" end="00:52:43.160" style="s2">and monas speak to the holes such that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.090" end="00:52:46.610" style="s2">one can refer to discrete parts and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.160" end="00:52:48.410" style="s2">continuous holes and then finally I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.610" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">reading up on Chinese metaphysics and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.410" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">discovered that we way has an opposite</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:55.340" style="s2">you way and if you&#39;re familiar with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:59.420" style="s2">way could you tell me if you way is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.340" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">suchness as Wu way is to Moniz yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.420" end="00:53:02.869" style="s2">don&#39;t know about you where I would like</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.280" end="00:53:04.580" style="s2">to know more about that that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.869" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">time anybody&#39;s ever mentioned it to me I</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.580" end="00:53:08.780" style="s2">mean 29 years of practice so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:13.100" style="s2">pretty astonishing well done for you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.780" end="00:53:14.660" style="s2">that&#39;s great so I&#39;d like to know more</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.100" end="00:53:18.490" style="s2">about that so I can&#39;t comment on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.660" end="00:53:22.310" style="s2">third but the sexiness to thickness and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.490" end="00:53:24.470" style="s2">the and the more nests to noting this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.310" end="00:53:28.220" style="s2">that I get that right is that the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.470" end="00:53:29.840" style="s2">matter right so let me work with that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.220" end="00:53:31.340" style="s2">one because I think that stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.840" end="00:53:32.900" style="s2">think there&#39;s a reason why you presented</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.340" end="00:53:36.260" style="s2">that first because I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.900" end="00:53:41.000" style="s2">foundational one um so I can&#39;t let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.260" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">I tend to think the such nurse as the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.000" end="00:53:45.710" style="s2">mystery that is founded individuation</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:49.010" style="s2">and the morning as the mystery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.710" end="00:53:52.930" style="s2">disclosed in participation I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.010" end="00:53:55.460" style="s2">think of what suchness</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:59.960" style="s2">moving like yeah moving into</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.460" end="00:54:04.310" style="s2">instantiation and whereas the morning is</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.960" end="00:54:06.980" style="s2">moving into not instantiation but</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.310" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">something more like emanation I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.980" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">a sense of eternity I yeah I think if if</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:19.369" style="s2">we take if we take thing this as it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:21.049" style="s2">always the name of in</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.369" end="00:54:23.269" style="s2">the middle of Middle Ages with it was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.049" end="00:54:24.920" style="s2">say city I can&#39;t remember the term but</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.269" end="00:54:29.660" style="s2">what mate would actually mean something</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.920" end="00:54:32.210" style="s2">a particular thing and in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.660" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">they were trying to get out what made it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.210" end="00:54:37.720" style="s2">a non repeatable non categorical raw</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:41.509" style="s2">individual that was instantiated</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.720" end="00:54:46.819" style="s2">in that sense of thickness I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.509" end="00:54:48.529" style="s2">yeah relate such nesting this and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.819" end="00:54:51.049" style="s2">I&#39;m using the word fingers here the word</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.529" end="00:54:53.329" style="s2">you use because I&#39;m hoping that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.049" end="00:54:55.309" style="s2">agreeing that we&#39;re not identifying</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.329" end="00:54:57.769" style="s2">things with object we&#39;re not about</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.309" end="00:55:00.589" style="s2">identifying thickness with objects I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.769" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">identifying thinness with uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.589" end="00:55:07.730" style="s2">the instantiation of of a raw individual</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:11.079" style="s2">and so the and the morning with the no</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.730" end="00:55:14.650" style="s2">thickness yes that makes sense to me too</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.079" end="00:55:22.819" style="s2">yeah because the morning is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.650" end="00:55:24.920" style="s2">opening towards yeah the the the I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.819" end="00:55:29.029" style="s2">I&#39;m struggling for adjectives here but</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.920" end="00:55:31.910" style="s2">the the the sense of the ground by which</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.029" end="00:55:33.619" style="s2">all intelligibility emerges or emanates</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.910" end="00:55:36.589" style="s2">whichever when you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.619" end="00:55:40.930" style="s2">yeah the more I think on this the more I</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.589" end="00:55:44.359" style="s2">like it if again we don&#39;t identify</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.930" end="00:55:46.609" style="s2">thinness with being an object because I</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.359" end="00:55:49.700" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s the same and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.609" end="00:55:52.069" style="s2">have identified no thickness with being</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.700" end="00:56:00.410" style="s2">some kind of secret amorphous substance</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.069" end="00:56:01.460" style="s2">behind everything the data well the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.410" end="00:56:04.269" style="s2">thickness I think we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.460" end="00:56:06.170" style="s2">negotiate a bit further but I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.269" end="00:56:08.869" style="s2">mostly on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.170" end="00:56:11.960" style="s2">and then just very quickly would you say</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.869" end="00:56:14.930" style="s2">that such nurse refers to discrete part</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.960" end="00:56:16.759" style="s2">and mourners to continuous holes the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.930" end="00:56:19.549" style="s2">discrete and continuous dichotomy is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.759" end="00:56:22.130" style="s2">there what I&#39;m getting it I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.549" end="00:56:24.289" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a sense in which it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.130" end="00:56:25.700" style="s2">but I I have the time I&#39;ve been reading</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.289" end="00:56:29.630" style="s2">what are the Aeneid but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.700" end="00:56:32.990" style="s2">Aeneid on on the intelligible right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.630" end="00:56:34.790" style="s2">he goes on and on about the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.990" end="00:56:38.780" style="s2">understand individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.790" end="00:56:41.090" style="s2">determination in spatial terms because</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.780" end="00:56:43.250" style="s2">we&#39;re taking something that&#39;s altered</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.090" end="00:56:45.590" style="s2">this is what this is this is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.250" end="00:56:47.420" style="s2">sort of resisting identifying thickness</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.590" end="00:56:49.730" style="s2">with objects because objects are</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.420" end="00:56:51.940" style="s2">typically well maybe not maybe if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.730" end="00:56:54.560" style="s2">think about Wharton&#39;s hyper objects but</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.940" end="00:56:56.270" style="s2">objects and that comes up in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.560" end="00:56:58.250" style="s2">contrast with hyper objects objects are</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.270" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">spatially defined and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.250" end="00:57:07.430" style="s2">hesitant to understand as&#39; in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:11.780" style="s2">spatial distinctions like Parkman Hall</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.430" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">now he does propose that it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.780" end="00:57:16.700" style="s2">to think of partner Hall in non spatial</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:19.220" style="s2">terms and I&#39;m really trying to wrap my</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.700" end="00:57:21.290" style="s2">head around what that means and he has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.220" end="00:57:23.540" style="s2">lot of confidence that he is making</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.290" end="00:57:25.460" style="s2">sense and I get glimmers of that so</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.540" end="00:57:28.790" style="s2">sorry strong this is going to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.460" end="00:57:33.940" style="s2">a dodgy answer but it&#39;s an honest answer</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.790" end="00:57:38.170" style="s2">insofar insofar as I think the thickness</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.940" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to talk about the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.170" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">individuation is a particular determine</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:46.520" style="s2">that a particular determination a</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:50.210" style="s2">determinate Ness and in that sense a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.520" end="00:57:52.580" style="s2">boundedness but but but not identifying</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.210" end="00:57:54.770" style="s2">that with spatial localization and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.580" end="00:57:59.690" style="s2">limitation then I would say yes to what</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.770" end="00:58:01.640" style="s2">you just said okay yeah I think the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.690" end="00:58:05.410" style="s2">page and it&#39;ll be very useful for future</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.640" end="00:58:05.410" style="s2">questions as well so thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.900" end="00:58:13.820" style="s2">sorry sorry I did I was hoping to i hope</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.290" end="00:58:16.310" style="s2">mark is still here because i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.820" end="00:58:21.410" style="s2">know if mark I found my answer to his</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.310" end="00:58:24.590" style="s2">question helpful yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m here I</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.410" end="00:58:27.230" style="s2">think the next of the meditative</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.590" end="00:58:31.190" style="s2">practices John that that answer was was</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.230" end="00:58:34.850" style="s2">pretty helpful and and if I can indulge</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.190" end="00:58:36.500" style="s2">a follow-up I was curious if Karzai and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.850" end="00:58:39.350" style="s2">particular has anything to say about</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.500" end="00:58:41.630" style="s2">that process sort of outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.350" end="00:58:43.160" style="s2">moving practices and meditation for so</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.630" end="00:58:45.800" style="s2">for people who can&#39;t or won&#39;t engage</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.160" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">with meditation want you to give them</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.800" end="00:58:48.799" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:52.670" style="s2">continuous sampling that integration</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.799" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">phase yeah so that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.670" end="00:58:55.910" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:58.130" style="s2">hey I mean so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.910" end="00:58:59.480" style="s2">discussion about transfer appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.130" end="00:59:01.549" style="s2">processing and how you get people to</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.480" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">transfer and creating what are called</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.549" end="00:59:05.809" style="s2">implementation plans and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:07.400" style="s2">implementation plans have this right</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.809" end="00:59:09.890" style="s2">this is how you get people to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.400" end="00:59:11.900" style="s2">long term goals and the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.890" end="00:59:14.269" style="s2">within a good implementation plan is</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.900" end="00:59:17.569" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it has to get this sweet</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.269" end="00:59:21.829" style="s2">spot there&#39;s balance between giving</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.569" end="00:59:25.490" style="s2">people a whole sequence of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.829" end="00:59:27.380" style="s2">benchmarks that they move towards but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.490" end="00:59:30.799" style="s2">has to be integrated with giving them</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.380" end="00:59:33.049" style="s2">ongoing immediately appliable coping</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.799" end="00:59:34.730" style="s2">strategies because people also tend to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.049" end="00:59:36.920" style="s2">abandon these things when they hit</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.730" end="00:59:39.319" style="s2">difficulties or problems which they</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.920" end="00:59:41.150" style="s2">can&#39;t cope with so I think the issue I</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.319" end="00:59:42.829" style="s2">think what you&#39;re drawing out from me</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.150" end="00:59:46.039" style="s2">which i think is very helpful the issue</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.829" end="00:59:48.019" style="s2">isn&#39;t only triggering people like I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.039" end="00:59:50.539" style="s2">talked about to you before but the issue</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.019" end="00:59:53.569" style="s2">is how can we afford transfer and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.539" end="00:59:57.170" style="s2">not just transfer that&#39;s how do we give</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.569" end="01:00:01.990" style="s2">people the right balance between a sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.170" end="01:00:05.980" style="s2">of schedule of goals and ongoing a</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.990" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">capacity for coping with unexpected</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.980" end="01:00:10.910" style="s2">difficulties and challenges and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">that is something that I try to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.910" end="01:00:18.170" style="s2">about as a teacher and I try to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:21.650" style="s2">about the degree to which modeling helps</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.170" end="01:00:25.250" style="s2">people with coping whereas involvement</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.650" end="01:00:28.430" style="s2">to a an ongoing community helps people</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.250" end="01:00:32.859" style="s2">with long term goals so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.430" end="01:00:32.859" style="s2">trying to get a bit of an answer there</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.509" end="01:00:40.990" style="s2">perfect thank you thank you</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.920" end="01:00:42.520" style="s2">Brad I can take one more question and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.990" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">then I gotta go if that&#39;s so good</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.520" end="01:00:45.970" style="s2">all right okay actually I and I sorry I</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:47.710" style="s2">know there are a lot of people with</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.970" end="01:00:50.830" style="s2">questions but I just actually like to</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.710" end="01:00:52.840" style="s2">give Laureen a chance to ask a question</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.830" end="01:00:56.470" style="s2">she is running she just started running</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.840" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">a weekly study group on the weekend from</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.470" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">the meaning crisis and she had coming</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:05.530" style="s2">out of that chlorine or the rain is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:10.810" style="s2">Laureen did I hear you correctly is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.530" end="01:01:11.290" style="s2">correct yes Lert all right oh wait she</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.810" end="01:01:16.180" style="s2">gone</p>

<p begin="01:01:16.180" end="01:01:26.530" style="s2">gonna read it out it&#39;s just coming from</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.800" end="01:01:28.680" style="s2">the study group discussion of episode</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.530" end="01:01:31.060" style="s2">three of waking from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.680" end="01:01:33.550" style="s2">continuous cosmos and modern grant</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.060" end="01:01:35.380" style="s2">grammar can you tell us more about myths</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.550" end="01:01:37.600" style="s2">and the relevance of grammar as a psycho</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.380" end="01:01:39.670" style="s2">technology in our discussion I somehow</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.600" end="01:01:41.140" style="s2">concluded that myths or stories and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.670" end="01:01:44.020" style="s2">usage of the past present and future</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.140" end="01:01:46.390" style="s2">tenses grammar is relevant to inspire</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.020" end="01:01:51.700" style="s2">creative insight and then and the call</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.390" end="01:01:55.030" style="s2">to action okay so I should first of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.700" end="01:01:56.770" style="s2">note when I&#39;m talking about grammar</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.030" end="01:02:01.000" style="s2">their cultural cognitive grammar I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.770" end="01:02:03.610" style="s2">using it as a by analogy I&#39;m using it</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.000" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">the way sort of Dickens time did I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.610" end="01:02:07.870" style="s2">talking about sort of linguistic grammar</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:09.400" style="s2">but so I&#39;m not clear on what you said</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.870" end="01:02:11.740" style="s2">because your question could be mean that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.400" end="01:02:13.840" style="s2">but I&#39;m talking more about cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.740" end="01:02:18.040" style="s2">grammar I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.840" end="01:02:21.040" style="s2">constraints on on conceptual generation</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.040" end="01:02:24.490" style="s2">conceptual linkage and the connections</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.040" end="01:02:27.100" style="s2">between link&#39; concepts and perception</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.490" end="01:02:28.690" style="s2">and practices so I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.100" end="01:02:31.990" style="s2">something that&#39;s not specifically a</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.690" end="01:02:35.590" style="s2">linguistic phenomena and how I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.990" end="01:02:39.160" style="s2">about myths is I think about them yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.590" end="01:02:45.220" style="s2">very much as stories but there are they</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.160" end="01:02:48.070" style="s2">are stories that have a central symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.220" end="01:02:49.870" style="s2">and ritual aspect to them and this week</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.070" end="01:02:52.490" style="s2">I talked about this much later in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.870" end="01:02:53.869" style="s2">series so this isn&#39;t just promise</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.490" end="01:02:59.780" style="s2">they&#39;ll be more there for you in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.869" end="01:03:04.430" style="s2">series on this that I think a symbol has</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.780" end="01:03:08.840" style="s2">a symbol is something that affords</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.430" end="01:03:12.290" style="s2">communication it affords a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.840" end="01:03:14.930" style="s2">between what&#39;s inside our current</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.290" end="01:03:17.450" style="s2">framing and what&#39;s outside of it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.930" end="01:03:19.730" style="s2">beyond it so one in one instance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.450" end="01:03:23.060" style="s2">not should not be reduced to this one</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.730" end="01:03:24.560" style="s2">instance of where we need symbols is in</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.060" end="01:03:26.540" style="s2">the relationship between our conscious</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.560" end="01:03:28.580" style="s2">and our unconscious processing because</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.540" end="01:03:30.530" style="s2">what comes into consciousness has been</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.580" end="01:03:33.980" style="s2">framed in a particular way and often</p>

<p begin="01:03:33.980" end="01:03:38.210" style="s2">aspects of the environment that need to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.200" end="01:03:39.710" style="s2">be brought in but it&#39;s unconscious to us</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.210" end="01:03:42.410" style="s2">so we need a symbol that bridges between</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.710" end="01:03:46.220" style="s2">the unconscious and the conscious or the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.410" end="01:03:51.050" style="s2">symbol can bridge between our everyday</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.220" end="01:03:53.480" style="s2">way of framing things and experiences we</p>

<p begin="01:03:53.480" end="01:03:58.040" style="s2">experience to get us a sense of a more</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.340" end="01:03:59.990" style="s2">encompassing and deeper contact with</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.040" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">reality that&#39;s very hard to put into</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.990" end="01:04:06.710" style="s2">words and we need to symbolically relate</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:07.850" style="s2">it or symbols are very important and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.710" end="01:04:10.580" style="s2">talked about this much later in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.850" end="01:04:14.270" style="s2">series in bridging between my framing of</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.580" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">who I am now and my aspiration to who I</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.270" end="01:04:20.930" style="s2">want to be so there&#39;s many ways in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:24.740" style="s2">symbols bridge between things that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.930" end="01:04:26.810" style="s2">have a sort of clear grasp on and things</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.740" end="01:04:30.440" style="s2">that we only have the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.810" end="01:04:31.960" style="s2">only extending towards in our in our</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.440" end="01:04:35.480" style="s2">relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.960" end="01:04:40.070" style="s2">intelligibility so myths are stories in</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.480" end="01:04:42.140" style="s2">which symbols play a crucial role for</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.070" end="01:04:43.940" style="s2">getting us into aspiration or getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.140" end="01:04:45.980" style="s2">the unconscious and the conscious to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.940" end="01:04:48.080" style="s2">talk to each other or getting our</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.980" end="01:04:51.290" style="s2">everyday experience to talk to our</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.080" end="01:04:55.010" style="s2">transformative experiences and miss</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.290" end="01:04:58.460" style="s2">present these symbol these symbols in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.010" end="01:05:00.530" style="s2">way that is perennial II attracted to us</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.460" end="01:05:03.140" style="s2">that&#39;s what I meant when I said miss</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.530" end="01:05:06.140" style="s2">aren&#39;t about ancient stories from the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.140" end="01:05:10.369" style="s2">past they&#39;re about ways of</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.140" end="01:05:12.589" style="s2">Bhalla CLE activating our cognition so</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.369" end="01:05:17.329" style="s2">that we are capable of picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.589" end="01:05:20.210" style="s2">patterns that are otherwise not not</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.329" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">intelligible or not visible or disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.210" end="01:05:25.010" style="s2">to us and so that&#39;s why myth it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:27.230" style="s2">bound up with some kind of ritual</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.010" end="01:05:29.510" style="s2">practice some kind of regular and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.230" end="01:05:31.789" style="s2">reliable practice by which people are</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.510" end="01:05:33.910" style="s2">trying to transform consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.789" end="01:05:39.170" style="s2">cognition character and communitas</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.910" end="01:05:40.430" style="s2">because symbols are only grasped</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.170" end="01:05:42.829" style="s2">that&#39;s not even quite the right words</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.430" end="01:05:45.799" style="s2">symbols are only living to you they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.829" end="01:05:48.140" style="s2">only alive in you when they are bound up</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.799" end="01:05:50.000" style="s2">with when they are affording and are</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.140" end="01:05:54.410" style="s2">bound up with processes of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.000" end="01:05:58.099" style="s2">transformation and so I think that what</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.410" end="01:06:02.839" style="s2">symbols do sort what myths do are create</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.099" end="01:06:08.089" style="s2">stories that put together dramas of</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.839" end="01:06:11.480" style="s2">ritual and symbol that actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.089" end="01:06:14.569" style="s2">transform our cognitive cultural grammar</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.480" end="01:06:17.410" style="s2">so that we can aspire so that we can uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.569" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">that we can engage in self transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.410" end="01:06:22.190" style="s2">so that we can come to a more fuller</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:23.720" style="s2">form of interest psychic communication</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.190" end="01:06:26.750" style="s2">between the conscious and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.720" end="01:06:30.710" style="s2">unconscious mind that&#39;s why I take myth</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.750" end="01:06:33.710" style="s2">so deeply seriously when I even wonder</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.710" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">about the possibility of post narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.710" end="01:06:39.890" style="s2">or trans narrative myth myth that</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.839" end="01:06:43.369" style="s2">doesn&#39;t rely on narrative structures the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.890" end="01:06:46.099" style="s2">work that Sally mukbang does on parables</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.369" end="01:06:47.900" style="s2">and the way a parable looks like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.099" end="01:06:49.640" style="s2">narrative and it draws you into</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.900" end="01:06:51.829" style="s2">narrative thinking and then it blows it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.640" end="01:06:55.819" style="s2">apart and undermines it it explodes it</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.829" end="01:06:57.349" style="s2">so that you move into a trans narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.819" end="01:07:00.920" style="s2">transformation like the myth of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.349" end="01:07:03.259" style="s2">prodigal son they&#39;re very Sufi myths I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.920" end="01:07:07.069" style="s2">very interested in the possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.259" end="01:07:09.980" style="s2">myth might not be necessarily tied to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.069" end="01:07:13.400" style="s2">narrative but typically it has been</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.980" end="01:07:15.769" style="s2">typically it has been so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.400" end="01:07:18.259" style="s2">that&#39;s my answer to that question</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.769" end="01:07:19.820" style="s2">excellent question and like I say there</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.259" end="01:07:22.130" style="s2">is a lot more discussion</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.820" end="01:07:24.770" style="s2">both in the series later episodes of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.130" end="01:07:27.080" style="s2">series in the plane the zombie book in</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.770" end="01:07:30.830" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing with Chris Christopher</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.080" end="01:07:33.140" style="s2">Master Pietro on this topic of myth it</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.830" end="01:07:37.550" style="s2">is an inexhaustible topic as it rightly</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.140" end="01:07:40.340" style="s2">should be well thank you so much once</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.550" end="01:07:42.680" style="s2">again for another great Q&amp;A the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.340" end="01:07:45.530" style="s2">questions were all great and your answer</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.680" end="01:07:47.120" style="s2">is obviously just as engaging as ever</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.170" end="01:07:58.070" style="s2">community and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.180" end="01:08:00.170" style="s2">that is false modesty I mean it I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:08:06.080" end="01:08:10.820" style="s2">expected pressing the hope that I can</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.270" end="01:08:13.220" style="s2">sort of live up to the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.820" end="01:08:15.260" style="s2">responsibility I have to how rich</p>
