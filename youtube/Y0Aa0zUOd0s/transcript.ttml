<p begin="00:00:07.460" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">hi my name is Andrew Sweeney and welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.379" end="00:00:17.360" style="s2">to my podcast today I&#39;d like to speak</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">about one of my personal heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.360" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">somebody who greatly affected me in my</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:29.810" style="s2">life especially I think in the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:33.829" style="s2">years but also all through my adult life</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.810" end="00:00:38.690" style="s2">and that is Leonard Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.829" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">so one letter Cohen passed last year</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.690" end="00:00:44.390" style="s2">around the same time Trump was elected I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">spend about a few months writing about</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.390" end="00:00:49.710" style="s2">his music in his words miss lyrics in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:55.380" style="s2">his poetry and so I&#39;m gonna read you</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.710" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">some of what I wrote so this one I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.380" end="00:01:00.180" style="s2">called meditations on Leonard Cohen and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">I called the entire project my landlord</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.180" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">because I very briefly lived in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">building owned by Leonard Cohen back in</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:15.359" style="s2">Montreal in the late 90s meditations on</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:17.039" style="s2">Leonard Cohen number one I want to write</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.359" end="00:01:20.340" style="s2">a different kind of book about Leonard</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.039" end="00:01:22.469" style="s2">Cohen nothing biographical or academic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.340" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">but something that that would emulate</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.469" end="00:01:30.179" style="s2">and mirror the music so what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">book would that be well certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.179" end="00:01:35.689" style="s2">words would have to be well chosen the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:39.200" style="s2">meaning compressed the form tight</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.689" end="00:01:41.539" style="s2">there&#39;d have to be a good simple melody</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.200" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">it would have to be minimalistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.539" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">suggests more than it reveals it would</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">be highly enjoyable and yet at the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:55.369" style="s2">time provocative it would not fear to</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:58.579" style="s2">enter dark landscapes of the soul</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.369" end="00:02:02.840" style="s2">it&#39;s philosophical pessimism would evoke</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.579" end="00:02:05.329" style="s2">hope and goodwill from the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.840" end="00:02:10.879" style="s2">that Things Fall Apart would arise a</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:27.049" style="s2">work in other words written without</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:31.489" style="s2">promise of money but for sheer love of a</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.170" end="00:02:42.079" style="s2">meant to be like a song and prose rather</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.079" end="00:02:52.099" style="s2">and suggestive tune much is left unsaid</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.849" end="00:02:54.140" style="s2">and unspoken and much is implied again I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.099" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">think this is harmonious with Leonard&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:14.750" style="s2">as much as I&#39;m the fan I aspire to meet</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.260" end="00:03:18.799" style="s2">mr. Cohen as a fellow songwriter and</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.260" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">freedom I skipped the Hollywood gossip</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.099" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">and go straight for the gold his works</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:37.190" style="s2">these essays are my way of humming along</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:40.760" style="s2">with the songs but they also seek to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.190" end="00:03:42.890" style="s2">prose songs in themselves as a</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.310" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">these are a series of unrequited love</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:04.819" style="s2">Cohen said somewhere that he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.579" end="00:04:08.299" style="s2">consider himself precisely a poet but a</p>

<p begin="00:09:15.010" end="00:09:20.830" style="s2">the Cohens music is brightly colored</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.430" end="00:09:31.330" style="s2">notice just how deep that smile goes a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:33.160" style="s2">thousand kisses deep perhaps Leonard</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.330" end="00:09:35.290" style="s2">Cohen didn&#39;t make serious music until he</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.160" end="00:09:37.810" style="s2">was over 30 so it&#39;s normal that his</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.810" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">in permanent adolescence he was always</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">considered more European than American</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:49.529" style="s2">in Europe older artists are beloved and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:52.510" style="s2">the cult of youth is not so pronounced</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.529" end="00:09:54.630" style="s2">American pop culture sacrifices its</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.660" end="00:10:03.010" style="s2">Cohen was a little different firstly</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.940" end="00:10:05.640" style="s2">because he was Canadian and already</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.010" end="00:10:08.650" style="s2">quite mature when he was first noticed</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.640" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">he had already lived so much and avoided</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.650" end="00:10:16.120" style="s2">many deathly traps that fame provides a</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.110" end="00:10:32.740" style="s2">unlike pop music which privileges</p>

<p begin="00:10:43.750" end="00:10:48.329" style="s2">Cohen is on another level</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.660" end="00:10:51.610" style="s2">he is detached enough to make you laugh</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.329" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">engaged enough to cut you to pieces he</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">knows he is putting on a show and how</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.680" end="00:10:57.910" style="s2">did he know &#39;he&#39;s how to make it real at</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:11:00.339" style="s2">the same time that is why there is no</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.910" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">better vocal music to put on after</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.770" end="00:11:14.290" style="s2">to artists and critics when talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.990" end="00:11:16.030" style="s2">about other artists Bob Dylan was the</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.000" end="00:11:23.020" style="s2">right he noticed that while people talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.770" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">about Cohen&#39;s words all the time they</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.020" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">missed the brilliance of his melody and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:31.210" style="s2">understated his quality as a musician</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.470" end="00:11:33.640" style="s2">the melodies are deep and subtle which</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.210" end="00:11:35.860" style="s2">explains our lasting power and unlike</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.640" end="00:11:37.690" style="s2">most singers Cohen&#39;s voice became richer</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.860" end="00:11:41.950" style="s2">and fuller over time as those</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.690" end="00:11:44.050" style="s2">unnecessary high notes fell away some</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.950" end="00:11:45.700" style="s2">people say that Cohen has no voice but</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.050" end="00:11:48.580" style="s2">they don&#39;t notice how deep in the belly</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:57.910" style="s2">again it&#39;s no surprise that when Leonard</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.960" end="00:12:01.570" style="s2">Cohen was a young man he was a master at</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.910" end="00:12:04.350" style="s2">hypnosis he is hypnotic but also highly</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.570" end="00:12:07.330" style="s2">wakeful and connected to the heart</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.350" end="00:12:09.510" style="s2">Cohen songs contain that 3:00 in the</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.740" end="00:12:17.560" style="s2">I may be uniquely qualified to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.120" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">something about Leonard Cohen&#39;s music</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.560" end="00:12:21.790" style="s2">for a couple of reasons for one thing I</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.430" end="00:12:39.490" style="s2">was a Zen temple at the time for a few</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.060" end="00:12:54.640" style="s2">that I received the same degree as Cohen</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.640" end="00:13:01.180" style="s2">parallels are striking in my choice of</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.290" end="00:13:13.020" style="s2">in fact when I met him in the 1990s I</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.780" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">had little idea of his effect on me I</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.020" end="00:13:18.360" style="s2">was even surprised when her reviewer</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:20.190" style="s2">described my first album called monotone</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.730" end="00:13:35.280" style="s2">grew on me over the years oh how well I</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.530" end="00:14:01.560" style="s2">there was a lively scene there Cohen has</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.070" end="00:20:19.400" style="s2">those songs anew every single night this</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.450" end="00:20:21.770" style="s2">was different than in the early days of</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.400" end="00:20:24.920" style="s2">his career when his performances</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.770" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">appeared painful assimilation a</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.100" end="00:20:35.420" style="s2">taught Cohen to perform from the zero</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.420" end="00:20:40.340" style="s2">moment perhaps that is why every concert</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.500" end="00:20:52.670" style="s2">about those last tours was to see an</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.930" end="00:20:56.060" style="s2">elderly man reached the summit of his</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.670" end="00:20:58.580" style="s2">spiritual powers so late in life usually</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.060" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">such power is spent and wasted on youth</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.580" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">but Cohen actually seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:06.590" style="s2">experienced a second life or a spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.050" end="00:21:21.559" style="s2">in those shows there was a sense that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.580" end="00:21:24.170" style="s2">worshipped his audience as intensely as</p>
