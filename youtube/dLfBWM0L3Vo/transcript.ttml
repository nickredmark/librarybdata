<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">so they&#39;re noisy and committed and so</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:27.810" style="s2">too much on the radical left let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">although I certainly face the majority</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.810" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">of my opposition from the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">but the radical right types are not very</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:37.369" style="s2">fond of me either there was a new book</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.399" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">the vagaries of Twitter pylons but</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.299" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">what&#39;s directed at you is at a whole</p>

<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:18.840" style="s2">how do you as an individual take or</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:21.050" style="s2">channel that hatred to good and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.840" end="00:02:23.850" style="s2">imagine it affects your family as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.050" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">well part of it is that I have a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.850" end="00:02:28.200" style="s2">solid family you know I have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:33.060" style="s2">people behind me like my wife is firmly</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.200" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">behind me without hesitation my children</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.060" end="00:02:37.830" style="s2">are behind me and they&#39;re smart and</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">mature and my parents are behind me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.830" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">I have a good set of friends and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:47.370" style="s2">generally I try not to talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:51.870" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know something about which</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.370" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">also helps yeah so and I&#39;m not impressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.870" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">with the sorts of ideological positions</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">that have been put forth especially by</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">the left-wing radical types in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:03.300" style="s2">universities and I understand what</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and why reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.300" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">and I feel that whatever vitriol happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">to be directed at me is trivial in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">of its danger in comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.690" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">overwhelming social danger that these</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">ideologies are producing and so better</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">to do something about it now than to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">wait also in a social media world that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">is dominated by extremism and hatred and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">vitriol people I know who have have</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:38.610" style="s2">watched you are literally dumbstruck by</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">your ability to remain civil and to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.610" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">engage in debate without getting angry</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">at those who who often absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:46.860" style="s2">lambaste you I think I&#39;ve only seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:50.040" style="s2">there was a debate you did with Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.860" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">Fry where an American pastor had to go</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.040" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">and I think I saw some fire there I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:03:56.580" style="s2">think you were genuinely upset but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">seem to have a remarkable remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.580" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">ability to play the ball not the man or</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">well that debate the Munk debate that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.209" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about mostly I was upset</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.310" end="00:04:12.120" style="s2">about the foolishness you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">person I was debating with call owed me</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.120" end="00:04:20.900" style="s2">an angry white man and it just struck me</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">is so so rhetorically foolish and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.900" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">inflammatory and unnecessary all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:27.639" style="s2">those things at the same time first of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:29.439" style="s2">all he was in Canada and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.639" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">not in the United States and those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.439" end="00:04:33.969" style="s2">of statements actually don&#39;t go over</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:35.830" style="s2">very well in Canada and my race had</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.969" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">absolutely nothing to do with what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.830" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">were talking about and so it was just</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">the kind of troublemaking statement that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">does nothing but make things worse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">I&#39;m never happy when I see people</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:53.050" style="s2">behaving in a manner that only makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:55.629" style="s2">things worse and so that that and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.050" end="00:04:57.490" style="s2">even it&#39;s a funny thing I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.629" end="00:04:59.770" style="s2">exactly felt bad for him but I thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:01.990" style="s2">it was so foolish of him to undermine</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.770" end="00:05:04.889" style="s2">his own credibility in that manner it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.990" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">was just the sort of performance that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.889" end="00:05:09.969" style="s2">removes all patience you know a bad</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:12.430" style="s2">rhetorical statement and unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.969" end="00:05:14.219" style="s2">racist comment a rhetorical flourish</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.430" end="00:05:16.180" style="s2">that had nothing but counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.219" end="00:05:19.539" style="s2">consequences as you can see by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.180" end="00:05:21.460" style="s2">YouTube commentary added nothing at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.539" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">that was productive to the debate didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.460" end="00:05:27.219" style="s2">address the issues at hand was a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">method of scoring points a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.219" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">playing victim I mean it was altogether</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:37.180" style="s2">a second great performance and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">because he had academic pretensions was</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.180" end="00:05:41.979" style="s2">a professor I have a lot less patience</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:44.589" style="s2">for professors and professional</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.979" end="00:05:46.629" style="s2">journalists than I do for you know other</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.589" end="00:05:48.460" style="s2">people because well because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.629" end="00:05:50.080" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to well that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.460" end="00:05:52.779" style="s2">profession I thought Stephen Fry was</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.819" style="s2">brilliant in that debate and he started</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.779" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">out soggy didn&#39;t agree with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.819" end="00:05:59.289" style="s2">what you said but he was gonna stand</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:01.539" style="s2">next to you and fight you aside and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.289" end="00:06:03.639" style="s2">also said I&#39;m the world would be a much</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.539" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">better place if everyone was less</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.639" end="00:06:07.689" style="s2">convinced of how right they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">yeah well Stephen Fry is really</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.689" end="00:06:11.349" style="s2">something it was a pleasure to meet him</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:13.300" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s quite the remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.349" end="00:06:15.490" style="s2">person so that was one of the very good</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.300" end="00:06:17.050" style="s2">things about that evening we&#39;re gonna</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.510" end="00:07:00.250" style="s2">of their accusations I didn&#39;t think he</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:10.600" style="s2">many people have watched it but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.290" end="00:07:12.580" style="s2">listened to it but I suspect quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.600" end="00:07:18.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s no wonder because it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.580" end="00:07:20.980" style="s2">a real feat of journalistic persistence</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.520" end="00:07:24.820" style="s2">I would say on your part you didn&#39;t let</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.990" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">for the last two years it&#39;s really quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.930" end="00:07:39.400" style="s2">appalling and that what seems to happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:41.290" style="s2">generally in the journalistic sphere on</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.400" end="00:07:44.169" style="s2">the negative side for me is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.290" end="00:07:46.810" style="s2">a list of epithets that are it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.810" end="00:07:50.950" style="s2">epithets that are sort of at hand maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.240" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">they have them on a little sticky on</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.950" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">their computer misogynist homophobe</p>

<p begin="00:08:09.070" end="00:08:13.750" style="s2">that comes up now and then and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.800" end="00:08:15.400" style="s2">seems to be that if you don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.750" end="00:08:17.500" style="s2">what someone says that you just lay out</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.400" end="00:08:19.090" style="s2">the longest possible list of pejoratives</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.500" end="00:08:21.610" style="s2">that your imagination your collective</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.610" end="00:08:26.380" style="s2">one of them is sufficiently true in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.130" end="00:08:29.710" style="s2">sense because of something you once said</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.380" end="00:08:32.349" style="s2">that it sticks and you&#39;re done and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.710" end="00:08:34.150" style="s2">it&#39;s getting downright dull I mean well</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.349" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">I decide that it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.150" end="00:08:38.080" style="s2">liberal journalists throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:42.070" style="s2">Western world have been lining up to try</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:43.659" style="s2">and take you down yeah well I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.070" end="00:08:46.030" style="s2">had a fair number of journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.659" end="00:08:48.370" style="s2">being supportive supportive of me now</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.030" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">whether or not they are on the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.370" end="00:08:52.390" style="s2">side they&#39;re certainly not on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">radical left side yes this has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.390" end="00:08:57.399" style="s2">happening pretty much non-stop for too</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:59.500" style="s2">years and they&#39;re basically out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.399" end="00:09:02.050" style="s2">insults as far as I can tell which in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.500" end="00:09:03.790" style="s2">some sense disarms them but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.050" end="00:09:06.220" style="s2">actually getting rather dull to read</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.790" end="00:09:08.079" style="s2">because it&#39;s always the same old thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.220" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">although the person you interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.079" end="00:09:12.790" style="s2">yesterday did have a new twist which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">greatest threat to the civilization of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.790" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">New Zealand which was really quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:20.829" style="s2">impressive as far as pejoratives went</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:23.170" style="s2">alright so we&#39;ve dealt with Auckland</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.829" end="00:09:27.490" style="s2">piece action I know you&#39;re in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.170" end="00:09:30.760" style="s2">now has the if you like the violent</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.490" end="00:09:32.709" style="s2">opposition to you for whatever reason is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.760" end="00:09:34.510" style="s2">it starting to subside and I know they</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.709" end="00:09:37.450" style="s2">haven&#39;t been protests as I understand so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.510" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">far in Australia there was a few in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.450" end="00:09:43.390" style="s2">Adelaide but about twenty five and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:46.209" style="s2">and they it wasn&#39;t exactly clear what</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.390" end="00:09:50.279" style="s2">they were protesting they seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.209" end="00:09:53.860" style="s2">more concerned about homosexual rights</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.279" end="00:09:55.779" style="s2">which I don&#39;t really know what that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.860" end="00:09:58.260" style="s2">to do with me but it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.779" end="00:10:00.760" style="s2">whatever they were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.260" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">protesting but there was nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.760" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">Melbourne at all though there was quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:06.459" style="s2">a large police presence at the venue</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:08.380" style="s2">while there were a lot of people there</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.459" end="00:10:10.810" style="s2">was about 5,500 people but there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.380" end="00:10:15.190" style="s2">a single protester and I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.810" end="00:10:18.190" style="s2">yes overall the virulence and also the</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.190" end="00:10:21.699" style="s2">frequency of the hit pieces in the media</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.190" end="00:10:24.579" style="s2">is has declined rather precipitously in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.699" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">the last three or four months and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.579" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s because well because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:33.399" style="s2">become dreadfully repetitious and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:35.470" style="s2">because no smoking pistol of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.399" end="00:10:37.959" style="s2">has emerged you know people have gone</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.470" end="00:10:39.850" style="s2">over virtually everything I&#39;ve said to</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.959" end="00:10:43.720" style="s2">students for the last 20 years because</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.850" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">almost all of it is recorded and scoured</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.720" end="00:10:50.170" style="s2">my twitter feed and my facebook and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:52.390" style="s2">know all the social media platforms that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.170" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">are usable and haven&#39;t been able to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.390" end="00:10:59.110" style="s2">anything so far that&#39;s of sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:11:02.110" style="s2">reprehensibility to take my reputation</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.110" end="00:11:04.750" style="s2">out but the dot so that we had Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.110" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">come on yellow yeah well it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.750" end="00:11:09.170" style="s2">bit weird it&#39;s it&#39;s very weird but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.170" end="00:11:17.959" style="s2">something I were absent</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:20.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say alright um I want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.959" end="00:11:22.760" style="s2">two years and in many ways I look at you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.839" end="00:11:24.620" style="s2">and if I was gonna put you in a fable</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.760" end="00:11:27.589" style="s2">you&#39;re the guy who said the emperor has</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.269" end="00:11:36.589" style="s2">feminism did you plan two years ago to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">be where you are now a cultural for not</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.589" end="00:11:42.889" style="s2">global cultural phenomenon was it all</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:45.800" style="s2">part of some some clever manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.889" end="00:11:48.620" style="s2">you know modern social media or did you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.800" end="00:11:52.220" style="s2">just stand up and say I&#39;m not gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.620" end="00:11:54.290" style="s2">this well I mean I was writing a book</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.220" end="00:11:56.810" style="s2">and I was hoping it would be successful</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.290" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">so there was that and you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.810" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">been experimenting quite substantially</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:05.630" style="s2">with with YouTube putting my my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:07.160" style="s2">from the University on YouTube and some</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:10.040" style="s2">lectures that I had done for a small</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.160" end="00:12:11.750" style="s2">television show and they were developing</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.040" end="00:12:15.290" style="s2">a certain following so I had about a</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">was that if you did that that you would</p>

<p begin="00:17:51.630" end="00:17:57.240" style="s2">what what elevates the financial</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:17:59.580" style="s2">productivity of companies is quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.240" end="00:18:01.620" style="s2">trade conscientiousness which is a</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.179" end="00:18:20.580" style="s2">reason for that and this is the non</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:22.770" style="s2">racist and non sexist way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.580" end="00:18:26.490" style="s2">the world by the way is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.770" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">far more difference between individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.490" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">within groups than there are between</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:36.059" style="s2">groups because look the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:38.280" style="s2">racist sexist ethnocentric proposition</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.059" end="00:18:40.049" style="s2">is that there are more differences</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.280" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">between groups of people then there are</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:46.409" style="s2">yes that&#39;s essentially the racist</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:47.850" style="s2">doctrine yeah and so we need some black</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.409" end="00:18:50.010" style="s2">people because you know all those black</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.850" end="00:18:52.650" style="s2">people are the same and unless we have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.010" end="00:18:57.559" style="s2">voice or two from a black person then we</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.650" end="00:19:01.620" style="s2">don&#39;t have that set of identity issues</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.559" end="00:19:04.890" style="s2">represented well it&#39;s just simply not</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.620" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">the case because most of the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.890" end="00:19:08.340" style="s2">comes at the level of individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">personality and temperament and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:12.270" style="s2">literature on that is crystal clear you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:14.429" style="s2">know these these these are pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.270" end="00:19:15.750" style="s2">intellectual claims made by people on</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.750" end="00:19:20.220" style="s2">dangerous because they&#39;re easily shifted</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.150" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">into the sorts of things that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.220" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">radical right likes to enjoy which is oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:29.159" style="s2">I see there are immutable differences</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:32.130" style="s2">between gender sexes and the races and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.159" end="00:19:37.020" style="s2">they&#39;re of substantial import and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.130" end="00:19:40.770" style="s2">we we we we need to take them into</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.020" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">account would we&#39;re what what would you</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.770" end="00:19:43.740" style="s2">say formulating such things as</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.740" end="00:19:48.120" style="s2">so no there&#39;s no evidence that those</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.140" end="00:19:50.159" style="s2">claims are correct and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.120" end="00:19:52.710" style="s2">counter evidence for much of it for so</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.159" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">example in in Scandinavia and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.710" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">this is as close to psychological fact</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.650" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">which means you open the doors for more</p>

<p begin="00:20:05.580" end="00:20:10.230" style="s2">with regards to sex and and that&#39;s had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:11.790" style="s2">big effect because of course there&#39;s far</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.790" end="00:20:17.040" style="s2">than there once was you increase the</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.650" end="00:20:23.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety of reasons for that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.570" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">least a dozen and they&#39;re all important</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.790" end="00:20:29.160" style="s2">one of which is that women especially</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:32.610" style="s2">once they hit their 30s prefer to work</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.160" end="00:20:34.740" style="s2">part time and that&#39;s not bad or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.610" end="00:20:38.910" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly not an indication of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.740" end="00:20:41.550" style="s2">systemic sexism so the the radical types</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.910" end="00:20:43.860" style="s2">like to have one explanation everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.550" end="00:20:46.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly the same with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:49.110" style="s2">outcome therefore the system is a</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.110" end="00:20:53.400" style="s2">learn that in one minute in a in a</p>

<p begin="00:20:53.400" end="00:20:57.660" style="s2">you have an answer for every problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.620" end="00:20:59.850" style="s2">that ever besets you politically for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.660" end="00:21:02.700" style="s2">rest of your life and there&#39;s no excuse</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.850" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">for it it&#39;s appalling scholarship I want</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.700" end="00:21:06.930" style="s2">to come back to that point the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:09.690" style="s2">thing bill proposed bill we have before</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.930" end="00:21:11.820" style="s2">our Parliament is the idea of six</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.820" end="00:21:17.180" style="s2">for people to alter their birth</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.540" end="00:21:29.400" style="s2">legislation well the first thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:31.170" style="s2">say it might be useful to really assess</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.400" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">some important problems that would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.170" end="00:21:35.910" style="s2">the first thing you&#39;re dealing with an</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:37.770" style="s2">absolutely tiny minority of people not</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.910" end="00:21:39.750" style="s2">that that&#39;s completely without import</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.770" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">but the second thing is it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.750" end="00:21:46.920" style="s2">thought through and it&#39;s not I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been followed we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.920" end="00:21:51.720" style="s2">just having a little hiccup there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.460" style="s2">we&#39;re talking to dr. Jordan B Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.720" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">who&#39;s joining us from Scott from Sydney</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.460" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">Jordan we were talking about sir sex</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:00.180" style="s2">self-identification changes or proposed</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:02.730" style="s2">reforms and New Zealand you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.180" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">fiercely it&#39;s a tiny number of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.730" end="00:22:08.700" style="s2">affected and secondly you say we need to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.220" end="00:22:09.990" style="s2">think it through and what way well one</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.700" end="00:22:12.780" style="s2">of the things that&#39;s happened for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.990" end="00:22:15.420" style="s2">example so really what this is is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.780" end="00:22:20.010" style="s2">attempt by a certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:23.429" style="s2">ideological movement to to put forth the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.010" end="00:22:25.770" style="s2">insistence that sex is only a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.429" end="00:22:28.530" style="s2">sociological construct that it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.770" end="00:22:31.380" style="s2">something learned and so that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.530" end="00:22:33.240" style="s2">changed at whim which is also a strange</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.380" end="00:22:35.850" style="s2">thing because if it&#39;s learned it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.240" end="00:22:37.860" style="s2">really be changed at whim and also if</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.850" end="00:22:39.090" style="s2">it&#39;s learned it could be unlearned which</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.860" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">is something that the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.090" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">putting this legislation forward aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:45.450" style="s2">really thinking through because that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.570" end="00:22:48.210" style="s2">opens up the opportunity for people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.450" end="00:22:51.210" style="s2">would like to reform people who would</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.210" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">like to change their gender back to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.210" end="00:22:55.590" style="s2">normative behavior because if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:58.290" style="s2">learned it can be unlearned but more</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.590" end="00:23:01.020" style="s2">importantly sex roles are not only</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.290" end="00:23:03.419" style="s2">learned they&#39;re partly learned and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.020" end="00:23:06.030" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of biological differences</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.419" end="00:23:07.950" style="s2">between men and women and there and many</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.030" end="00:23:09.630" style="s2">of them aren&#39;t trivial like men and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.950" end="00:23:11.870" style="s2">women are more the same than they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.630" end="00:23:14.880" style="s2">different but the differences are quite</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.870" end="00:23:16.830" style="s2">market at the extremes and so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.880" end="00:23:19.860" style="s2">seeing partly as a consequence of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.830" end="00:23:22.410" style="s2">now is the movement of say trans women</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.860" end="00:23:24.090" style="s2">into female sports you saw this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.410" end="00:23:29.340" style="s2">Minnesota just the other day I think it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.090" end="00:23:32.580" style="s2">was Minnesota where a newly transition</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.340" end="00:23:35.040" style="s2">trans woman has been shattering though</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.049" end="00:23:43.950" style="s2">Commonwealth Games competitor it was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.179" end="00:23:45.929" style="s2">form of mine it&#39;s absolutely insane you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.950" end="00:23:47.880" style="s2">know I mean first the fact that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.929" end="00:23:49.740" style="s2">allowed to begin with is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.880" end="00:23:52.429" style="s2">comprehension it&#39;s a real sign of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:53.850" style="s2">cultural insanity and the second is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.429" end="00:23:57.330" style="s2">psychologically it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.850" end="00:24:01.260" style="s2">incomprehensible I can&#39;t imagine how you</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.330" end="00:24:03.299" style="s2">could be a man who transformed himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.260" end="00:24:06.110" style="s2">into a woman in all the ways that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.299" end="00:24:10.049" style="s2">possible and then decided to go compete</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.110" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">in it high level sports arena with women</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.049" end="00:24:14.669" style="s2">who&#39;ve been training their whole lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:18.090" style="s2">to hit the peak of their ability and</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.669" end="00:24:20.610" style="s2">then to absolutely bloody demolish them</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.090" end="00:24:23.400" style="s2">say after a year of work and then to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.610" end="00:24:25.800" style="s2">tout that as some sort of victory for</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.400" end="00:24:28.860" style="s2">the oppressed it&#39;s completely what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.800" end="00:24:31.769" style="s2">narcissistic beyond comprehension and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.860" end="00:24:34.409" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s well it&#39;s a sign of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.769" end="00:24:37.080" style="s2">happens when you don&#39;t carefully think</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.409" end="00:24:39.480" style="s2">things through all sorts of unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.080" end="00:24:41.490" style="s2">consequences tend to manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.480" end="00:24:44.039" style="s2">and you see the same thing happening now</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.490" end="00:24:46.830" style="s2">with rapid onset gender dysphoria and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.039" end="00:24:49.140" style="s2">the treatment of very young people with</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.830" end="00:24:51.990" style="s2">very powerful hormonal and surgical</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.519" end="00:25:02.580" style="s2">way in 15 years when these kids grow up</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:04.769" style="s2">and hit adulthood and start tossing out</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.580" end="00:25:06.809" style="s2">lawsuits as they certainly will and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.769" end="00:25:08.789" style="s2">should where we&#39;re going to look back</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.809" end="00:25:11.940" style="s2">and wonder just exactly what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.789" end="00:25:14.220" style="s2">was wrong with us so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.940" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">well it&#39;s Jeff I&#39;ve been by this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.220" end="00:25:18.720" style="s2">ideology that that&#39;s been formulated by</p>

<p begin="00:25:18.720" end="00:25:23.669" style="s2">insist because they have no biological</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.159" end="00:25:39.210" style="s2">look at the Millennial Generation</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.019" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">they get a bit of stick here they called</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.210" end="00:25:43.620" style="s2">snowflakes they seem to get outraged not</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">only on their own behalf but on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.620" end="00:25:49.230" style="s2">of others at the drop of a hat and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:51.809" style="s2">use social media as elsewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:55.139" style="s2">world to call out the things they find</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.809" end="00:25:57.870" style="s2">offensive or that their feelings do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.139" end="00:26:00.059" style="s2">think there is a collective generational</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.630" end="00:26:08.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if the millennial</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.179" end="00:26:20.190" style="s2">and experimented you know crazily with</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:22.590" style="s2">psychedelic drugs and a wild lifestyle</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.190" end="00:26:25.590" style="s2">and promiscuous sex and all of those</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.590" end="00:26:32.309" style="s2">are any worse or any better I do think</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.990" end="00:26:35.570" style="s2">that there is a small subset of them who</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.559" end="00:31:01.559" style="s2">and and the more responsibility I take</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.429" end="00:33:39.570" style="s2">yeah well the thing is you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.110" end="00:33:41.549" style="s2">why that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.570" end="00:33:43.500" style="s2">what I tried to do with my lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.549" end="00:33:45.539" style="s2">partly because I&#39;m a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.500" end="00:33:48.840" style="s2">psychologist it&#39;s like we have all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.539" end="00:33:51.649" style="s2">more rules and and people are told the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.840" end="00:33:54.120" style="s2">rules but they&#39;re very seldom given a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.649" end="00:33:57.480" style="s2">multi-dimensional explanation of why the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.120" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">rules are necessary you know it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.480" end="00:34:00.509" style="s2">you should do it because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:02.129" style="s2">people do or that&#39;s because you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.509" end="00:34:04.139" style="s2">that&#39;s what good people do or it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.129" end="00:34:07.620" style="s2">responsibility and all those things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.139" end="00:34:10.530" style="s2">true but it&#39;d be an explanation of why</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.620" end="00:34:12.629" style="s2">it&#39;s true and how it&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.530" end="00:34:15.270" style="s2">responsibility that gives your life</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.629" end="00:34:17.490" style="s2">meaning and also improves the world your</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.270" end="00:34:19.290" style="s2">family and the community that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.490" end="00:34:21.720" style="s2">often lacking and so that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:24.270" style="s2">trying to provide and it&#39;s clear and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.720" end="00:34:27.780" style="s2">and and in English as clear as I could</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.270" end="00:34:29.550" style="s2">manage it and so you know it I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.780" end="00:34:32.280" style="s2">to make it practical and useful for</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.550" end="00:34:34.619" style="s2">people and I&#39;m really very very happy to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.280" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">hear that it&#39;s worked for you and for</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.619" end="00:34:39.349" style="s2">your family I&#39;m thrilled to hear it as I</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:42.510" style="s2">always am when I hear a story like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.349" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">Peter joins us now welcome Peter how you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.510" end="00:34:52.379" style="s2">doing yeah yeah hello how are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.060" end="00:34:55.109" style="s2">Peter very very well hey um have you in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.379" end="00:34:58.319" style="s2">a moment of self-reflection had a look</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.109" end="00:35:01.680" style="s2">back on this amazing and astounding</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.319" end="00:35:03.660" style="s2">following you created and and wondered</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.680" end="00:35:06.089" style="s2">where it&#39;s going to end up because at</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.660" end="00:35:08.160" style="s2">the risk of sounding oxymoronic you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.089" end="00:35:13.560" style="s2">probably the closest thing particularly</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.160" end="00:35:16.440" style="s2">manatees to a messiah well I thought</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.560" end="00:35:19.109" style="s2">about that I wouldn&#39;t say precisely in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.440" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">those terms I mean one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.109" end="00:35:23.069" style="s2">did learn from studying Carl Jung years</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:25.500" style="s2">ago was that if you&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.069" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">about archetypal stories which I do all</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.500" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">the time that you have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:32.940" style="s2">careful not to confuse yourself with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:36.599" style="s2">archetype you know and so I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:37.590" style="s2">very cognizant of the danger of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.599" end="00:35:40.170" style="s2">of popular</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.590" end="00:35:42.090" style="s2">that I&#39;m experiencing and and I do mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.170" end="00:35:44.970" style="s2">the danger because the higher you fly</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.090" end="00:35:46.980" style="s2">the faster you can fall and and you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.970" end="00:35:50.790" style="s2">to be very careful to ensure that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.980" end="00:35:53.910" style="s2">not increasing the probability of that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.790" end="00:35:56.300" style="s2">try to make sure that I credit other</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.910" end="00:35:58.980" style="s2">people with many of the ideas that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.300" end="00:36:01.080" style="s2">formulated and because I&#39;ve learned a</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.980" end="00:36:04.350" style="s2">lot from reading the great clinicians</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.080" end="00:36:06.690" style="s2">and and philosophers of the last say 150</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.350" end="00:36:09.090" style="s2">years and from my clinical practice and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.690" end="00:36:12.090" style="s2">so on and so and I think of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.090" end="00:36:13.830" style="s2">endeavor not as something that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.090" end="00:36:16.500" style="s2">but as something that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.830" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">collectively engaged in because I know</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.500" end="00:36:21.840" style="s2">that you know that there&#39;s an old idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:24.360" style="s2">that every person is a center of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.840" end="00:36:27.120" style="s2">world and that the weight of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.360" end="00:36:29.220" style="s2">for better or worse weighs upon the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.120" end="00:36:30.300" style="s2">shoulders of each person and I really</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.220" end="00:36:33.120" style="s2">believe that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.300" end="00:36:35.940" style="s2">and so if you know that then it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.120" end="00:36:39.000" style="s2">the egotism and the arrogance down</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.940" end="00:36:41.160" style="s2">partly out of sheer terror and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.000" end="00:36:43.740" style="s2">it much more effective to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.160" end="00:36:45.690" style="s2">people like when I&#39;m lecturing in front</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.740" end="00:36:48.840" style="s2">of an audience I&#39;m not lecturing to them</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.690" end="00:36:50.870" style="s2">you know I&#39;m lecturing with them talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.840" end="00:36:53.820" style="s2">about problems that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.870" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">including me and aims that we all all</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.820" end="00:36:58.380" style="s2">need to develop including me and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:37:00.270" style="s2">have to include yourself so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.380" end="00:37:02.280" style="s2">among the sinners and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.270" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">reprehensible types in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.280" end="00:37:08.190" style="s2">communicate with people properly and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:10.500" style="s2">do my best to ensure that I&#39;m starkly</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.190" end="00:37:13.790" style="s2">aware of my shortcomings and faults at</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.500" end="00:37:16.530" style="s2">every moment I can possibly manage and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.790" end="00:37:19.410" style="s2">have family and friends who also help</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.530" end="00:37:20.850" style="s2">keep what I&#39;m doing in check and and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.410" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">make sure that it&#39;s not going sideways</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.850" end="00:37:24.750" style="s2">in some manner that&#39;s you know where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">taking things for granted or becoming</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.750" end="00:37:30.780" style="s2">arrogant or any of that and so so far</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:33.900" style="s2">that&#39;s worked out well and hopefully it</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.780" end="00:37:37.590" style="s2">will continue to JA welcome to the</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.430" end="00:37:50.040" style="s2">Zealand and one of the problems were one</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:51.810" style="s2">of the obsessions I would say we have in</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.040" end="00:37:58.120" style="s2">universities is a Ferguson</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.810" end="00:38:00.670" style="s2">race and gender so I&#39;m I would call it a</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.120" end="00:38:03.550" style="s2">centrist position somewhat liberal</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.670" end="00:38:07.780" style="s2">minded but what advice would you give a</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.550" end="00:38:10.090" style="s2">young academic pushing against what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.780" end="00:38:13.900" style="s2">see is the far less the gender of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.090" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">universities well the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.900" end="00:38:18.670" style="s2">would say is they&#39;re a lot more moderate</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:20.710" style="s2">types of your sort than you think and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.670" end="00:38:23.020" style="s2">if you&#39;re a careful person and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.710" end="00:38:25.330" style="s2">thinking things through and you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.020" end="00:38:28.090" style="s2">things to object to you can be sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.330" end="00:38:31.530" style="s2">virtually sure that a majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.090" end="00:38:37.660" style="s2">agree with you even though they&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.530" end="00:38:40.060" style="s2">cowed let&#39;s say to to speak up I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.660" end="00:38:42.070" style="s2">say get your thoughts in order you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.060" end="00:38:44.950" style="s2">so you know what you stand for and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.070" end="00:38:46.660" style="s2">I would also say don&#39;t agree with</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.660" end="00:38:51.580" style="s2">because all that&#39;ll happen and you&#39;re a</p>
