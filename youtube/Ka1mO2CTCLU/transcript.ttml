<p begin="00:00:26.279" end="00:00:38.430" style="s2">good to see all of you so first question</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.199" end="00:00:40.379" style="s2">well I guess I could catch you up on</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.430" end="00:00:43.589" style="s2">what&#39;s been happening first in case</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.379" end="00:00:45.900" style="s2">you&#39;re vaguely interested most of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.589" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">probably know or some of you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.900" end="00:00:51.720" style="s2">anyways about what happened at Wilfrid</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">Laurier University this week or two</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.720" end="00:00:58.979" style="s2">weeks ago teaching assistant named</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:01:02.610" style="s2">Lindsey Shepherd was interrogated I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.979" end="00:01:04.949" style="s2">would say by the typical suspects the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.610" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">kind of postmodern neo-marxist that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.949" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">been talking about hauled her into an</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">inquisition and proceeded to rake her</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">over the coals for having the gall to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">show a video that featured me about a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">year ago on a Canadian TV show called</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">the agenda they accused her of violating</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:34.050" style="s2">the criminal code essentially and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:36.120" style="s2">Canadian Human Rights Code under the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.050" end="00:01:38.120" style="s2">provisions of Bill c16 which was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.120" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">bill I warned about last year and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.120" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">accused her of transphobia and making an</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">unsafe environment and then they accused</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">me of being Hitler which was really</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:49.190" style="s2">quite interesting because I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:54.470" style="s2">been accused about being Hitler so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.190" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">modified my my Kermit puppet here which</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.470" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">see you can probably see that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">and I&#39;ve done a response video which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:06.330" style="s2">going to launch pretty soon so this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">Hitler the Frog and the spokes frog by</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.330" end="00:02:17.909" style="s2">the way and he well this is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:19.980" style="s2">come to so all right let&#39;s answer some</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.909" end="00:02:23.159" style="s2">questions I&#39;m going to start with pigeon</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.980" end="00:02:25.110" style="s2">hole which is the site that allows</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.159" end="00:02:26.909" style="s2">people to vote on questions and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.110" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">top flouted question is how do you I did</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.909" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">you testify a rejection of identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.830" style="s2">ism when a pillar of the neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:37.500" style="s2">strategy is to demographically replace</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.830" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">the indigenous people of Europe London</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.500" end="00:02:43.770" style="s2">it&#39;s less than half ethnically English</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:46.770" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s take that question apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.770" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">first of all it isn&#39;t self-evident to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.770" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">that it is specifically a neo-marxist</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:54.990" style="s2">strategy to demographically replace the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:57.150" style="s2">indigenous peoples of Europe and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.990" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">think that&#39;s the strategy anyways even</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">if that&#39;s the outcome because you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:03.960" style="s2">to distinguish between strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:06.090" style="s2">outcome the strategy and principle is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.960" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">bring in immigrants to balance out</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.090" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">declining birthrate now I&#39;m not saying I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:13.470" style="s2">agree with that I&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:16.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what the strategy is and then the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.470" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">next part of the question is predicated</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.710" end="00:03:22.980" style="s2">on the assumption that identitarian ISM</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:26.490" style="s2">is necessarily the answer to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.980" end="00:03:28.350" style="s2">of the problem that&#39;s being identified</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.490" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">which is characterized as excess</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.350" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">immigration first of all we&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">figure out exactly what identitarian is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">a means because it isn&#39;t clear if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.180" end="00:03:41.670" style="s2">means radical right-wing ethnic</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:44.489" style="s2">nationalism I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.670" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">going to be particularly constructive if</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.489" end="00:03:48.989" style="s2">it means having a sensible discussion</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:52.860" style="s2">about what the appropriate limits might</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.989" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">be on immigration and to think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.860" end="00:03:58.860" style="s2">that over the long run and also to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">a serious discussion about the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">which say Islam and and the West the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">values of Islam and the West are</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:13.110" style="s2">actually commensurate then that has to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">be obviously has to be done but so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.110" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">afraid that to answer that question I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:18.540" style="s2">have to know more about exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:20.280" style="s2">these terms were being were being</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.540" end="00:04:22.109" style="s2">defined especially with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.280" end="00:04:25.770" style="s2">identitarian ism because it&#39;s a vague</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.109" end="00:04:28.620" style="s2">word and so that&#39;s all I can do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.770" end="00:04:31.200" style="s2">that I lose my ability to think straight</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.620" end="00:04:34.140" style="s2">or intelligently in confrontational or</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.200" end="00:04:35.880" style="s2">unfriendly social situations any</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.140" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">suggestions for adaptation or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.880" end="00:04:42.810" style="s2">improvement well a couple I suppose one</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:44.340" style="s2">is is that when you get nervous in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.810" end="00:04:46.680" style="s2">kind of situation that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.340" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">what often happens to people is they</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.680" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">start paying attention to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">they get self-conscious so you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:53.879" style="s2">let&#39;s say I got self-conscious all of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:57.419" style="s2">sudden</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.879" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">this QA what would happen is that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.419" end="00:05:02.159" style="s2">start paying attention to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:04.259" style="s2">and the screen and what I&#39;m doing and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.159" end="00:05:06.209" style="s2">I&#39;d start paying attention to how I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.259" end="00:05:09.149" style="s2">feeling and to the nervousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.209" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">I&#39;d start to get aware that I was not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.149" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">responding properly and that would make</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.939" style="s2">me more nervous and then I would get</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:16.379" style="s2">more aware of that and that can just</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.939" end="00:05:17.909" style="s2">shut me down entirely and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.379" end="00:05:19.619" style="s2">happened to me now and then in a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.909" end="00:05:22.879" style="s2">and sometimes almost happened when I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.619" end="00:05:25.349" style="s2">talking to Sam Harris the first time I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.879" end="00:05:28.139" style="s2">paused for a long time and then became</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.349" end="00:05:29.789" style="s2">aware of the pause and then anyways what</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.139" end="00:05:32.339" style="s2">you have to do in a situation like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.789" end="00:05:34.649" style="s2">is it&#39;s not so much that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.339" end="00:05:36.659" style="s2">stop attending to yourself because if</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.649" end="00:05:38.759" style="s2">you start thinking I should stop</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.659" end="00:05:41.099" style="s2">attending to myself then you&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.759" end="00:05:45.229" style="s2">think about yourself more what you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.099" end="00:05:47.580" style="s2">to do instead is pay more attention to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.229" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">the situation and to the people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.580" end="00:05:51.179" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:55.080" style="s2">increase the degree to which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.179" end="00:06:00.959" style="s2">attending outwardly and that&#39;ll stop you</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.080" end="00:06:02.939" style="s2">from attending inwardly that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.959" end="00:06:04.769" style="s2">effective technique you can practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.939" end="00:06:06.089" style="s2">that generally speaking every time you</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.769" end="00:06:10.709" style="s2">get nervous start paying more attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.089" end="00:06:14.039" style="s2">and that&#39;ll that&#39;ll that&#39;ll help you out</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.709" end="00:06:16.759" style="s2">a lot yeah it&#39;s really good suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.039" end="00:06:19.979" style="s2">for social anxiety in general is that if</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.759" end="00:06:22.559" style="s2">you see most people but not everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.979" end="00:06:25.189" style="s2">most people have enough implicit social</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.559" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">skill because they were reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.189" end="00:06:29.639" style="s2">socialized when they were children so</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:31.469" style="s2">that they do know how to act in social</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.639" end="00:06:33.899" style="s2">situations but they get anxious and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.469" end="00:06:35.219" style="s2">that interferes with them implementing</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.899" end="00:06:37.949" style="s2">what they know just like if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.219" end="00:06:39.209" style="s2">pianist and you get anxious and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.949" end="00:06:41.219" style="s2">self-conscious while you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.209" end="00:06:43.229" style="s2">you&#39;ll forget what you know because</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.219" end="00:06:46.889" style="s2">while you&#39;ve activated a different part</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.229" end="00:06:48.539" style="s2">of your brain if you can remember to pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.889" end="00:06:50.129" style="s2">attention and you can direct your</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.539" end="00:06:52.199" style="s2">attention outward and you attend hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.129" end="00:06:53.819" style="s2">enough then what will happen and try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.199" end="00:06:57.300" style="s2">put the other person at ease and try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.819" end="00:06:59.879" style="s2">ask them questions then that&#39;ll kick in</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.300" end="00:07:01.800" style="s2">the automatic because you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.879" end="00:07:04.379" style="s2">attention to what the person is doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.800" end="00:07:06.900" style="s2">into their facial expressions and all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.379" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">that that will</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.900" end="00:07:13.410" style="s2">clue in the automatic and implicit</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">knowledge that you have and make things</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.410" end="00:07:22.139" style="s2">much more smooth and and and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:25.080" style="s2">free so attention really attention</p>

<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:50.639" style="s2">and I&#39;ve laid out a bunch of I&#39;ve laid</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:54.110" style="s2">out a philosophy of care and discipline</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.639" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">that&#39;s predicated partly on a French</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:08:00.060" style="s2">philosophical legal notion which is do</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:01.889" style="s2">not multiply rules beyond necessity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.060" end="00:08:04.620" style="s2">sort of like a legal equivalent talking</p>

<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:15.930" style="s2">but make sure that you properly enforce</p>

<p begin="00:08:20.130" end="00:08:23.729" style="s2">children the other thing you have to</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.729" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">and you know one of the aims that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.510" end="00:08:32.039" style="s2">have had most recently pushed by</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">clueless psychologists I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.039" end="00:08:38.729" style="s2">that you want children to have high self</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:41.909" style="s2">esteem and that&#39;s actually a large part</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.729" end="00:08:43.620" style="s2">trait neuroticism anyways but but and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.909" end="00:08:45.180" style="s2">can be modified to some degree Jerome</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.620" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">Kagan has done some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.180" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">work on that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.010" end="00:08:57.240" style="s2">the best thing to do I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.380" end="00:08:59.340" style="s2">thing to orient yourself towards with</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.240" end="00:09:02.370" style="s2">regards to children is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.340" end="00:09:04.260" style="s2">trying to make your child your children</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.370" end="00:09:07.320" style="s2">or help your children to be delightful</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.260" end="00:09:09.180" style="s2">in the eyes of others and so that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.320" end="00:09:10.890" style="s2">they have to be reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.180" end="00:09:12.930" style="s2">socialized and that really takes place</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.890" end="00:09:14.790" style="s2">between the ages of 2 &amp; 4 because what</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:16.740" style="s2">you want for your children is that when</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.790" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">they go out into public when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.740" end="00:09:20.760" style="s2">away from you or even with you for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:23.400" style="s2">matter what you want for your children</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.760" end="00:09:26.370" style="s2">is for other people to genuinely like</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.400" end="00:09:28.620" style="s2">them because if they behave reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.370" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">and they attend properly to adults and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.620" end="00:09:32.100" style="s2">they know how to play with other</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.610" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">children then wherever they go they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.100" end="00:09:37.830" style="s2">going to be um unless they encounter</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:39.840" style="s2">someone truly malevolent they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.830" end="00:09:41.540" style="s2">to be welcomed with smiles and open arms</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.840" end="00:09:44.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s not gonna be fake because</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.540" end="00:09:47.640" style="s2">almost every human being actually likes</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.400" end="00:09:50.700" style="s2">children if they&#39;re reasonably behaved</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.640" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">and so your job is to make your children</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:55.230" style="s2">highly socially desirable because that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:57.690" style="s2">opens up the world to them so there</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.230" end="00:10:00.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not a lecture series but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.690" end="00:10:03.030" style="s2">little lecture looking at myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.810" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">honestly John says I&#39;m deeply envious</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.030" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">and resentful of others happiness how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.430" end="00:10:11.790" style="s2">I turn this around well John I would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:15.330" style="s2">you&#39;ve started to turn it on around</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.790" end="00:10:16.650" style="s2">already because you have at least come</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.330" end="00:10:18.270" style="s2">to the conclusion that you&#39;re deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.650" end="00:10:19.770" style="s2">envious and resentful of others</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.270" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">happiness so you do have the damn</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.770" end="00:10:24.690" style="s2">problem diagnosed so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">you might do is figure out what you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.690" end="00:10:29.310" style="s2">would like instead like how would you</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:31.050" style="s2">like to feel about the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.310" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">because you&#39;re implying that being</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.050" end="00:10:36.600" style="s2">deeply envious and resentful isn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">the best so let&#39;s assume that you would</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.600" end="00:10:43.620" style="s2">rather be pleased about other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:45.390" style="s2">successes and not envious well you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.620" end="00:10:48.030" style="s2">the first thing you might think is well</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.390" end="00:10:51.090" style="s2">maybe you have to do some writing or at</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.030" end="00:10:53.220" style="s2">least some thinking it&#39;s like maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.090" end="00:10:55.770" style="s2">alternative would be to happy be happy</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.220" end="00:10:57.260" style="s2">about others success and happiness well</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.770" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">maybe you should start by thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.260" end="00:11:01.860" style="s2">why you might be happy about their</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:03.770" style="s2">happiness it&#39;s not like happiness is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.860" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">zero-sum game you know it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.770" end="00:11:06.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not and I believe me I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:08.670" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.810" end="00:11:10.380" style="s2">seriously and I think that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.670" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">saying characterizes plenty of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.380" end="00:11:16.200" style="s2">and I think that you&#39;re being deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">honest noticing it happiness isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.200" end="00:11:21.810" style="s2">zero-sum game you know lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:23.130" style="s2">can be happy at the same time and do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.810" end="00:11:25.650" style="s2">really want to live in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.130" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">other people are less happy would in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.650" end="00:11:29.730" style="s2">what possible manner would that be</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:32.430" style="s2">useful and good for you in the medium to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.730" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">long term it might make you feel you</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.430" end="00:11:39.900" style="s2">know grudgingly satisfied you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:41.970" style="s2">dark way temporarily but it&#39;s not a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.900" end="00:11:43.200" style="s2">good long term strategy so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.970" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">you got to think it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.200" end="00:11:47.460" style="s2">you know what how is it that you would</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:50.670" style="s2">like to view the world how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.460" end="00:11:52.710" style="s2">that would be best for you I mean as if</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.670" end="00:11:54.510" style="s2">you were taking care of yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.710" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">you like you&#39;re someone who deserves to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.510" end="00:11:58.710" style="s2">be taken care of think about how you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:00.810" style="s2">like to have the world how you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.710" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">view the world and one of the ways you</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.810" end="00:12:05.880" style="s2">can do that too is to think about some</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:07.560" style="s2">people that you admire and try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.880" end="00:12:10.140" style="s2">out how they look at the world or even</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.560" end="00:12:12.510" style="s2">ask them you know because maybe then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.140" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">can find out what it is about your</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.510" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">thought patterns that are driving you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:25.350" style="s2">down this sort of dark road so why are</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.589" style="s2">question and I&#39;m trying to keep it up</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:14.190" style="s2">I&#39;m actually feeling quite a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.589" end="00:14:16.440" style="s2">I was actually happy today and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.190" end="00:14:18.240" style="s2">so rare for the last while that I could</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.440" end="00:14:21.779" style="s2">hardly even recognize what it felt like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.240" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">so but I&#39;m definitely feeling better I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.779" end="00:14:25.949" style="s2">getting some energy in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:31.110" style="s2">so I I&#39;m really happy about that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.949" end="00:14:32.459" style="s2">thanks anyways I appreciate it thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.110" end="00:14:34.709" style="s2">on the radical left and their</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.459" end="00:14:36.870" style="s2">superficial view belief and value on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:38.670" style="s2">environment how is this influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.870" end="00:14:40.500" style="s2">their own raw emotions inviting</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.670" end="00:14:43.050" style="s2">questionable immoral and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.500" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">actions despite good intentions well I</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.050" end="00:14:46.410" style="s2">don&#39;t really buy the whole good</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">intentions thing I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.410" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to have good intentions</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:55.890" style="s2">like John the question I just answered</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:57.630" style="s2">you know John said looking at myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.890" end="00:14:59.940" style="s2">honestly I&#39;m deeply envious and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.630" end="00:15:02.790" style="s2">resentful of others happiness well if</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.940" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">you listen to the Lindsey Shepherd</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.790" end="00:15:08.490" style="s2">recording at Wilfred Laurier University</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:10.410" style="s2">and you listen to the professor&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.490" end="00:15:14.069" style="s2">that the administrators I think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.410" end="00:15:15.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s absurd to start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.069" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">the presupposition that they have good</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.839" end="00:15:21.240" style="s2">intentions I don&#39;t think they have good</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:22.889" style="s2">intentions at all so but you know we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.240" end="00:15:25.380" style="s2">could give the devil let&#39;s do and say</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.889" end="00:15:27.449" style="s2">that there are people on the left end of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.380" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">the spectrum like like there are on all</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.449" end="00:15:31.829" style="s2">parts of the spectrum who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:33.750" style="s2">do good things but having good</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.829" end="00:15:36.570" style="s2">intentions and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.750" end="00:15:39.780" style="s2">do well in the world our good intentions</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:42.890" style="s2">are only the beginning and people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.780" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">always influenced by raw emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.890" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">fuzzy thinking and it&#39;s hard to think</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:50.600" style="s2">critically and it&#39;s hard to plan</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">strategically and it&#39;s hard to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.600" end="00:15:54.540" style="s2">intervene in the world in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.860" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cause trouble which is partly</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.540" end="00:16:00.420" style="s2">why I recommend to people that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:02.280" style="s2">start local you know you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.420" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">trust your own good intentions to some</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.280" end="00:16:06.510" style="s2">degree because you have to test out what</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">you do when you have good intentions and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.510" end="00:16:12.360" style="s2">see if it actually produces the result</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:15.780" style="s2">that&#39;s intended but I wouldn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.360" end="00:16:17.460" style="s2">case to begin with that especially on</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.780" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">the radical end of the left I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.460" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">unbelievably motivated by resentment so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.620" end="00:16:28.950" style="s2">how does one save a marriage when it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.150" end="00:16:30.510" style="s2">seems that there is no longer attraction</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.950" end="00:16:31.950" style="s2">both physically and intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.510" end="00:16:33.480" style="s2">there are kids involved which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.950" end="00:16:37.620" style="s2">main reason for wanting to save the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.480" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">marriage huh well alright I know a</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.620" end="00:16:43.230" style="s2">couple of things about that I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:45.750" style="s2">first thing I would say is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.230" end="00:16:47.130" style="s2">haven&#39;t had any intimate interaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.750" end="00:16:50.730" style="s2">with one another for quite a long period</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.130" end="00:16:53.550" style="s2">of time that can put both people into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.730" end="00:16:56.370" style="s2">stagnant state where desire starts to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.550" end="00:16:58.710" style="s2">slip away what what sex therapists</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.370" end="00:17:01.530" style="s2">recommend under such conditions is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.710" end="00:17:03.660" style="s2">well essentially start in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.530" end="00:17:05.069" style="s2">start dating again so you could ask your</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.660" end="00:17:07.380" style="s2">partner to go out to a movie or</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.069" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">something like that and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.380" end="00:17:14.130" style="s2">when you come home you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:16.199" style="s2">neck for a little while like teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.130" end="00:17:18.839" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a word that no one uses</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.199" end="00:17:22.230" style="s2">anymore but kind of pull back and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.839" end="00:17:25.620" style="s2">gotta agree say not to engage in full</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.230" end="00:17:27.569" style="s2">sexual activity for a while but to tease</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.620" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">each other and to play a bit even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.569" end="00:17:32.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not attracted you have to act act</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:34.770" style="s2">it out for a while and hopefully you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.700" end="00:17:37.860" style="s2">get the motor running again the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.770" end="00:17:40.050" style="s2">thing I would say is that you guys might</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.860" end="00:17:43.950" style="s2">want to sit down and make a joint plan</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.050" end="00:17:46.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like what because a marriage is</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.950" end="00:17:47.460" style="s2">like a story that two people are acting</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.560" end="00:17:50.809" style="s2">out simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.460" end="00:17:54.419" style="s2">and you have to have shared goals and</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.809" end="00:17:56.490" style="s2">because you&#39;re both rowing the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.419" end="00:18:00.059" style="s2">let&#39;s say and if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.490" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">destination in mind then well maybe your</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.059" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">rowing in circles or maybe you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:07.440" style="s2">standing still so I would say work hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">to put some romance back in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.440" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">relationship you know you could say to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">each other look let&#39;s try this for six</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">months and just see how it goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:17.309" style="s2">we&#39;ll have two dates a week for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:19.860" style="s2">first month we won&#39;t have any sex but</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.309" end="00:18:21.929" style="s2">we&#39;ll play around and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.860" end="00:18:25.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll see how that goes and and but</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.929" end="00:18:28.110" style="s2">we&#39;ll try it out for them for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.010" end="00:18:30.090" style="s2">for the whole six months there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.110" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">reasons to save a marriage I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.090" end="00:18:33.929" style="s2">hard on kids divorce is really hard on</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:40.440" style="s2">kids and it&#39;s hard on the adults</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.929" end="00:18:43.590" style="s2">involved too so what I would say you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.440" end="00:18:45.330" style="s2">have to negotiate an agreement and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.590" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">you know you could try the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.330" end="00:18:48.870" style="s2">authoring program both of you what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:50.610" style="s2">would recommend for example is that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.870" end="00:18:53.159" style="s2">each do the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.610" end="00:18:54.809" style="s2">separately so that&#39;s at self authoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.159" end="00:18:56.789" style="s2">com because then you both have a life</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.809" end="00:18:59.940" style="s2">plan and then you could sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.789" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">read each other&#39;s future authoring plans</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.940" end="00:19:03.720" style="s2">and see if you have some things in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:06.090" style="s2">common and then see if you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:08.130" style="s2">out how to support each other with</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.090" end="00:19:08.789" style="s2">regards to each of you obtaining what</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.130" end="00:19:13.140" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.789" end="00:19:15.330" style="s2">so Paul Moloney asks you edited out a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.140" end="00:19:18.149" style="s2">disagreement with Camille Paglia what</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.330" end="00:19:19.890" style="s2">was it no no that&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.149" end="00:19:21.299" style="s2">there was a piece added it out but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.890" end="00:19:23.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t because there was a disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.299" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">it was because there was some glitch in</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.220" end="00:19:27.630" style="s2">the video or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">generally speaking and you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.630" end="00:19:32.610" style="s2">say this with absolute certainty but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:34.710" style="s2">do and so does my crew do everything we</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.610" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">possibly can to leave the videos alone</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.710" end="00:19:38.970" style="s2">except for getting rid of things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.149" style="s2">would be of no interest to anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.970" end="00:19:43.590" style="s2">are mistakes so there was no</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.149" end="00:19:45.570" style="s2">disagreement are you interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.590" end="00:19:47.279" style="s2">coming to Australia yes I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.570" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">invited a couple of times but it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.279" end="00:19:53.220" style="s2">worked out yet but my book will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.340" end="00:19:56.549" style="s2">published in Australia I think sometime</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.220" end="00:19:58.889" style="s2">in January as well and I imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.549" end="00:20:00.840" style="s2">all be coming there at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.889" end="00:20:06.270" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.840" end="00:20:07.830" style="s2">talk about my book and so on Trey says</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.270" end="00:20:09.510" style="s2">how can a person go through the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.830" end="00:20:11.340" style="s2">authoring process of imagining a future</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.510" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">for yourself as though you or someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.340" end="00:20:14.190" style="s2">you care about when you barely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:20.940" style="s2">care about yourself or even hate</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.190" end="00:20:23.190" style="s2">yourself yeah well I would say that go</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.940" end="00:20:26.580" style="s2">through the exercise anyways and and act</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.190" end="00:20:28.740" style="s2">as like try to extend to yourself some</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.580" end="00:20:31.140" style="s2">courtesy you know sometimes you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.740" end="00:20:33.960" style="s2">act something out before you can start</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:38.429" style="s2">to believe it and so I would say sit</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.960" end="00:20:40.830" style="s2">down and pretend that you&#39;re your friend</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.429" end="00:20:42.950" style="s2">you know Trey the probability that</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.419" end="00:22:01.500" style="s2">very very serious about that the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.820" end="00:22:05.010" style="s2">regarded themselves as National</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.500" end="00:22:07.710" style="s2">Socialists you know so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.010" end="00:22:09.419" style="s2">free-market capitalist let&#39;s say so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.710" end="00:22:11.309" style="s2">certainly weren&#39;t right-wingers in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.419" end="00:22:12.630" style="s2">way that free-market capitalists are</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.309" end="00:22:14.820" style="s2">right wingers even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.630" end="00:22:17.190" style="s2">probably more sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.820" end="00:22:18.990" style="s2">they differed from the International</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.190" end="00:22:20.940" style="s2">Socialists which were the Marxists</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.990" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">because they were much more concerned</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:27.660" style="s2">identity and to the degree that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:30.810" style="s2">regard nationalism and racial identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:32.940" style="s2">as primarily right-wing views then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.810" end="00:22:35.490" style="s2">Nazis would have been right-wing so</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.940" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">let&#39;s say that they maybe they pulled</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.490" end="00:22:40.290" style="s2">from the worst of both extreme something</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:42.930" style="s2">like that but I do think it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.290" end="00:22:44.900" style="s2">to note that their extreme nationalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.930" end="00:22:47.340" style="s2">and ethnocentrism and racial identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.900" end="00:22:49.620" style="s2">probably has more in common with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.340" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">radical right than it does with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.620" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">radical left which tends to be utopian</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:58.710" style="s2">Universal so one of the things I thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:00.540" style="s2">would be an interesting research project</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.710" end="00:23:02.760" style="s2">would be to take like a hundred Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.540" end="00:23:06.180" style="s2">policies and to turn them into a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.760" end="00:23:08.070" style="s2">questionnaire and ask people either how</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.180" end="00:23:09.780" style="s2">much they agree with them after I</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.070" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">figured out whether they were left or</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.780" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">right wing to begin with or whether they</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:15.990" style="s2">thought the policies were representative</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:17.610" style="s2">of the left or the right because that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.990" end="00:23:19.410" style="s2">could be studied empirically and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.610" end="00:23:21.930" style="s2">think anyone&#39;s done it but that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.410" end="00:23:24.930" style="s2">a very interesting that would be a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.930" end="00:23:27.540" style="s2">interesting research project he&#39;s left</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.930" end="00:23:31.020" style="s2">for helgesson a probably Matt Matt</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.540" end="00:23:32.790" style="s2">massacred that name says who has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.020" end="00:23:35.790" style="s2">higher IQ a really gifted mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.790" end="00:23:39.860" style="s2">or a really gifted painter very</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.790" end="00:23:42.780" style="s2">difficult to say but I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.860" end="00:23:44.670" style="s2">gifted method because if they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.780" end="00:23:46.650" style="s2">gifted they both have high IQs you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.670" end="00:23:49.140" style="s2">be certain of that it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.650" end="00:23:51.990" style="s2">to do anything that&#39;s truly gifted say</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.140" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">above the average above the norm without</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.990" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">being without having a very high IQ and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:59.130" style="s2">in a creative realm I mean you hear</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:01.260" style="s2">about these idiot savants who have like</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.130" end="00:24:03.780" style="s2">one area of extreme expertise but</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.260" end="00:24:05.340" style="s2">generally in those cases it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.780" end="00:24:07.590" style="s2">much that they have one area of extreme</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.340" end="00:24:10.440" style="s2">expertise it&#39;s that they have one area</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.590" end="00:24:11.880" style="s2">of above-average expertise that really</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.440" end="00:24:14.610" style="s2">contrasts with the rest of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.880" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">impairments but they rarely if ever make</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.610" end="00:24:20.730" style="s2">it into the you know the very short list</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:23.250" style="s2">of true geniuses mathematicians are kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.730" end="00:24:25.230" style="s2">of an odd Bunch though because you they</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.250" end="00:24:27.070" style="s2">peak really really early like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.230" end="00:24:29.500" style="s2">going to be a mathematician and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.070" end="00:24:32.530" style="s2">gifted then you&#39;re going to show signs</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.500" end="00:24:35.530" style="s2">of that when you&#39;re like 17 to 20</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.530" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">something like that whereas painters can</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.530" end="00:24:41.710" style="s2">can be creative through it their entire</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">lifespan I would say probably on average</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.710" end="00:24:46.120" style="s2">I would guess this is a guess that if</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">you took a hundred really gifted</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.120" end="00:24:49.570" style="s2">mathematicians and a hundred really</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:54.460" style="s2">gifted painters that the mathematicians</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.570" end="00:24:56.560" style="s2">would have far higher nonverbal IQs but</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.460" end="00:24:59.800" style="s2">the painters might have higher verbal</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.560" end="00:25:03.910" style="s2">IQs so that also complicates things see</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.800" end="00:25:06.580" style="s2">with IQ also you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.910" end="00:25:09.490" style="s2">this factor called the G factor which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.580" end="00:25:11.830" style="s2">the central element of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.490" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">it seems to be associated with such</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.830" end="00:25:15.940" style="s2">things as head size and brain size</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:18.550" style="s2">relative to body and neural conduction</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.940" end="00:25:21.970" style="s2">speed and simple reaction time like</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.550" end="00:25:25.540" style="s2">really basic physiological markers and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.970" end="00:25:28.450" style="s2">it&#39;s a pretty tight single factor say as</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.540" end="00:25:30.100" style="s2">opposed to the personality dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.450" end="00:25:33.130" style="s2">main where there&#39;s five quite clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.100" end="00:25:35.890" style="s2">factors but I think it was Earl hunts</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.130" end="00:25:38.350" style="s2">research indicated that as people get</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.890" end="00:25:40.630" style="s2">smarter and smarter the variability</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.630" end="00:25:44.200" style="s2">intelligence starts to increase so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.550" end="00:25:45.940" style="s2">sort of like there&#39;s a lot of ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.200" end="00:25:50.380" style="s2">really smart but there&#39;s only one way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.940" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">be not very smart so that&#39;s another</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.790" end="00:26:28.020" style="s2">question well look you&#39;re not under any</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.840" end="00:27:44.550" style="s2">relationship and if you&#39;re not then</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.310" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">assume that if going into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.550" end="00:27:49.140" style="s2">relationship your basic goal is honesty</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:53.180" style="s2">that you&#39;ll handle it appropriately when</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.140" end="00:27:53.180" style="s2">the situation comes up so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.260" end="00:28:03.550" style="s2">how would you address accusations that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.050" end="00:28:05.680" style="s2">you are creating another ideological</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.550" end="00:28:07.690" style="s2">group identity which is equal in its</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.680" end="00:28:11.740" style="s2">capacity for destruction to postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.690" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">Neel Marxism well I would address it the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.740" end="00:28:17.110" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been addressing it for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:19.480" style="s2">whole last year which is that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.110" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">trying to produce a group identity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.480" end="00:28:24.910" style="s2">any sort I&#39;m trying to get people to act</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:27.490" style="s2">locally in the confines of their own</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.910" end="00:28:29.860" style="s2">environment and to sort things out that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.490" end="00:28:32.590" style="s2">are under their direct control so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.860" end="00:28:34.180" style="s2">it&#39;s an elaboration of one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.590" end="00:28:36.130" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.180" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">which is that you should take the log</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.130" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">out of your own eye before you worry</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.100" style="s2">about the dust speck in your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:44.230" style="s2">eye which i think is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.100" end="00:28:46.120" style="s2">general maxim and so there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.230" end="00:28:50.800" style="s2">about that that&#39;s associated with group</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.120" end="00:28:54.550" style="s2">identity now people have tried to what</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.800" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">would you call it a tribute to me some</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.550" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">identity with the right or the alt right</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">or even the far right more recently even</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.200" end="00:29:04.150" style="s2">Hitler which is what came up in at</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:09.850" style="s2">wilfred laurier but i think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.150" end="00:29:12.490" style="s2">for that is is twofold one is look if</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.850" end="00:29:14.050" style="s2">you&#39;re imagine that there&#39;s a radical</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.490" end="00:29:15.940" style="s2">left that&#39;s not very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.050" end="00:29:20.200" style="s2">imagine and then imagine that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.940" end="00:29:23.170" style="s2">to the right of the radical left is are</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.200" end="00:29:24.820" style="s2">all in opposition to the radical left so</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.170" end="00:29:27.430" style="s2">then you have a group and the group is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.820" end="00:29:29.710" style="s2">all those in opposition to the radical</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.430" end="00:29:31.990" style="s2">left and that will include people on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.710" end="00:29:33.700" style="s2">radical right and so then when you look</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:36.220" style="s2">at that entire group so let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.700" end="00:29:38.110" style="s2">thousand people are 1500 people come in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.220" end="00:29:40.690" style="s2">here a talk that I give on free speech</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.110" end="00:29:42.670" style="s2">that happened on November 11th first of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.690" end="00:29:44.980" style="s2">all if there&#39;s 1,500 people in a room</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.670" end="00:29:46.120" style="s2">like 15 of them are gonna be completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.980" end="00:29:48.460" style="s2">out of their mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.120" end="00:29:51.850" style="s2">probably more like 30 but at least 15</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.460" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s just base rate and so to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.850" end="00:29:55.270" style="s2">demonstrate that the group was somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:57.310" style="s2">pathological you&#39;d have to show that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.270" end="00:29:58.690" style="s2">base rate of pathology was higher in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.310" end="00:30:00.400" style="s2">group than it would be in a randomly</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.690" end="00:30:03.460" style="s2">selected group and I&#39;ve seen no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.400" end="00:30:05.950" style="s2">of that but also even if there are a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.460" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">number of people say on the far right in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.950" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">that group that doesn&#39;t indicate at all</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:12.190" style="s2">that that&#39;s characteristic of the group</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s very hard to distinguish that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.190" end="00:30:15.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:17.560" style="s2">what tends to happen is that a group is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.040" end="00:30:22.120" style="s2">defined by the most egregious behavior</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.560" end="00:30:24.940" style="s2">of its most extreme members so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.120" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">the other way I did rest the accusation</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.940" end="00:30:28.510" style="s2">is that and I have done this as well and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:30.580" style="s2">I think it&#39;s what really protected me</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.510" end="00:30:33.610" style="s2">this whole year is that I have all these</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.580" end="00:30:37.120" style="s2">YouTube videos online you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.610" end="00:30:41.790" style="s2">600 hours of them and the message is</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.120" end="00:30:45.130" style="s2">pretty stable that then more the newer</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.790" end="00:30:47.290" style="s2">manifestation is you know a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.130" end="00:30:49.060" style="s2">focused critique of the university which</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.290" end="00:30:52.660" style="s2">i think is entirely justified but</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.060" end="00:30:54.550" style="s2">everything around that is focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.660" end="00:30:56.230" style="s2">individual and the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.550" end="00:30:58.660" style="s2">individual and the responsibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.230" end="00:31:01.720" style="s2">individual and so I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.660" end="00:31:08.860" style="s2">that is an ideological group identity so</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.720" end="00:31:12.390" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would address it so alright</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.860" end="00:31:12.390" style="s2">let&#39;s see what else we&#39;ve got here</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.420" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">what is the evolutionary reason for</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.700" end="00:31:37.490" style="s2">having consciousness I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:40.140" style="s2">Toby who asked that God Only Knows</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.490" end="00:31:42.300" style="s2">that&#39;s been a problem that people have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.140" end="00:31:44.490" style="s2">been hammering on for a long time I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.300" end="00:31:47.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the so-called zombie problem that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.490" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">David Chalmers has described which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.100" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">something like how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:54.510" style="s2">other people aren&#39;t exactly like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2">except acting in a completely determined</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.510" end="00:31:59.970" style="s2">manner and devoid of consciousness I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the evolutionary reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.970" end="00:32:04.020" style="s2">is for consciousness I mean I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.770" end="00:32:09.180" style="s2">speculate like what consciousness seems</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.020" end="00:32:12.060" style="s2">to be at least in part is a mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.180" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">repair so a lot of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.060" end="00:32:16.170" style="s2">do are unconscious you know like when</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:19.410" style="s2">you&#39;re driving if you&#39;re an expert</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.170" end="00:32:21.390" style="s2">driver you&#39;re you&#39;re using your eyes to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.410" end="00:32:25.170" style="s2">watch the road and your eyes are moving</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:26.940" style="s2">your hands and your arms but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.170" end="00:32:28.290" style="s2">really thinking about what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.940" end="00:32:30.330" style="s2">you&#39;re not attending to it consciously</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.290" end="00:32:32.430" style="s2">because you&#39;ve built circuitry already</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.330" end="00:32:35.670" style="s2">specialized circuitry that handles all</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.430" end="00:32:36.870" style="s2">those tasks now what happens when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.670" end="00:32:39.240" style="s2">driving let&#39;s say that you make a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.870" end="00:32:41.100" style="s2">mistake well then what happens is you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.240" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">consciously attend to the mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.100" end="00:32:47.010" style="s2">you attempt to revise the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.030" end="00:32:49.170" style="s2">automatic structure that produced the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.010" end="00:32:50.370" style="s2">error so imagine this imagine you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.170" end="00:32:55.110" style="s2">playing the piano and you&#39;re playing a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.370" end="00:32:56.730" style="s2">very complicated sequence and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.110" end="00:32:58.380" style="s2">stumble over part of it so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.730" end="00:33:00.300" style="s2">zooming along and you stumble over part</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.380" end="00:33:03.390" style="s2">of it and then you attend to that you go</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.300" end="00:33:06.030" style="s2">back and you slow down and you move your</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.390" end="00:33:08.460" style="s2">fingers slowly and you try to reprogram</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.030" end="00:33:10.740" style="s2">those little automatic units that have</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.460" end="00:33:12.690" style="s2">handled that part of it you repair them</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.740" end="00:33:14.280" style="s2">and and reprogram them and you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.690" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">faster and faster out it as they</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.280" end="00:33:18.050" style="s2">automatize and then you go so</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:21.270" style="s2">consciousness seems to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.050" end="00:33:23.730" style="s2">watches what you do automatically checks</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.270" end="00:33:26.430" style="s2">for errors and then repairs it and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.730" end="00:33:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s its function now you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.430" end="00:33:31.290" style="s2">why a repair mechanism like that would</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.920" end="00:33:34.380" style="s2">have to be associated with awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.290" end="00:33:36.630" style="s2">answer that is not only do I not know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.380" end="00:33:39.450" style="s2">don&#39;t think anyone knows if I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.630" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">speculating and which I&#39;ve done I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.450" end="00:33:43.809" style="s2">consciousness actually plays an intake</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">role in being itself because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.809" end="00:33:48.940" style="s2">convinced that there would be any being</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:50.769" style="s2">of any recognizable sort without a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.940" end="00:33:54.220" style="s2">conscious observer so I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.769" end="00:33:57.370" style="s2">consciousness is actually like a center</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.220" end="00:33:59.049" style="s2">point of the cosmos in some sense and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.370" end="00:34:02.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s because of ideas like that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.049" end="00:34:04.539" style="s2">that the grand archetypal idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.710" end="00:34:08.649" style="s2">soul has emerged and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.539" end="00:34:11.639" style="s2">correct so but how to precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.649" end="00:34:15.730" style="s2">integrate that with evolutionary theory</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.639" end="00:34:17.849" style="s2">apart from the description that already</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.730" end="00:34:24.690" style="s2">provided I just don&#39;t I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.849" end="00:34:24.690" style="s2">so let&#39;s see what else have we got here</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.990" end="00:34:29.560" style="s2">would you consider a more official</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.490" end="00:34:32.859" style="s2">consultancy role with Andrew sheers</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.560" end="00:34:34.780" style="s2">conservative party it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.859" end="00:34:36.839" style="s2">to say what I would consider it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.780" end="00:34:39.879" style="s2">obvious to me that Andrew Shearer would</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.839" end="00:34:42.909" style="s2">particularly like to have me as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.879" end="00:34:45.639" style="s2">official consultant I&#39;m kind of what</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.639" end="00:34:50.260" style="s2">that&#39;s the word right now and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.399" end="00:34:52.060" style="s2">know it&#39;s funny though because I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.260" end="00:34:56.290" style="s2">making this new video today which I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.060" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">alluded to earlier using good old what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.290" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2">this character here Hitler the Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:08.050" style="s2">the spokes frog and I I went back and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:10.030" style="s2">looked at my comments on Bill c16 last</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.050" end="00:35:12.369" style="s2">year which which were the comments that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.030" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">originally got me in hot water and had</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.369" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">me accused of all the things I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">accused of transphobia bigotry racism</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.660" end="00:35:23.050" style="s2">what else Oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.349" end="00:35:25.329" style="s2">fascism being on the far-right and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.050" end="00:35:27.670" style="s2">finally and to top it all off Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.329" end="00:35:30.700" style="s2">himself and one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.670" end="00:35:32.290" style="s2">realized was that that I was really calm</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.700" end="00:35:32.980" style="s2">during that video you couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.290" end="00:35:34.900" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.980" end="00:35:38.050" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t have offered a more</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.900" end="00:35:41.410" style="s2">mild-mannered criticism of Bill c16 and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.050" end="00:35:42.970" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty funny because you know this</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.410" end="00:35:46.359" style="s2">scandal that engulfed wilfred laurier</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.970" end="00:35:49.780" style="s2">this week is the worst scandal that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.359" end="00:35:54.599" style="s2">remember involving a university in in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.780" end="00:35:54.599" style="s2">my memory going back to the 1970s and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.619" end="00:35:58.099" style="s2">happened at Laurie it was exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.450" end="00:36:01.180" style="s2">predicted would happen except it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.099" end="00:36:05.480" style="s2">actually worse because they did accuse</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.480" end="00:36:09.529" style="s2">specifically and of contravening the</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.529" end="00:36:16.549" style="s2">know for all I know she might have done</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.240" end="00:36:19.130" style="s2">so we&#39;re at this situation where a TA</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.549" end="00:36:22.999" style="s2">showing a video of someone discussing</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.130" end="00:36:25.910" style="s2">pronouns in Canada can now be termed a</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.910" end="00:36:31.329" style="s2">federally and like all the usual</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.130" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">suspects have come out of their caves</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.329" end="00:36:36.829" style="s2">let&#39;s say like Brenda Cosman the lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.539" style="s2">I debated last year and said well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.829" end="00:36:41.420" style="s2">real stretch to assume that what Lynn&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.420" end="00:36:46.819" style="s2">sufficiently reprehensible to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.140" end="00:36:49.390" style="s2">constitute a violation of the Ontario</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.390" end="00:36:57.019" style="s2">policies it&#39;s a stretch so I guess we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.089" end="00:36:59.089" style="s2">supposed to feel good about that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.019" end="00:37:03.489" style="s2">probably a little bit too hot right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.089" end="00:37:06.799" style="s2">to serve in any official consultant role</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.489" end="00:37:11.329" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that I wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.799" end="00:37:13.039" style="s2">happy to speak to you know political</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.329" end="00:37:15.109" style="s2">figures who might be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.039" end="00:37:16.910" style="s2">speaking with me because you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.109" end="00:37:20.989" style="s2">generally speak to people who asked me</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.910" end="00:37:25.400" style="s2">to speak to them so as reprehensible as</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.989" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">that might be recently moved up and was</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.400" end="00:37:29.210" style="s2">promoted and not liking it because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:30.859" style="s2">have to adjust massively is there a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.210" end="00:37:32.329" style="s2">difference between liking your job and</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.859" end="00:37:34.789" style="s2">the lack of discipline to perform a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.329" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">change are there are they connected yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.789" end="00:37:40.670" style="s2">well they&#39;re definitely connected it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:43.279" style="s2">tough one the first thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.670" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">that if it was a real radical change you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.279" end="00:37:47.839" style="s2">know it takes people unless they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.710" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">young it takes people about a year to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.839" end="00:37:54.170" style="s2">adjust to a really radical change like</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:55.759" style="s2">to move to a new city to to adjust to</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.170" end="00:37:58.869" style="s2">being married that can take longer than</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.759" end="00:38:02.299" style="s2">a year to adjust to having a new baby to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.869" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">to getting over a relatively serious</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.299" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">loss like a death in the family a year</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2">you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:12.220" style="s2">the first thing you might ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.940" end="00:38:13.269" style="s2">is are there things that are good about</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.220" end="00:38:16.779" style="s2">the promotion</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.269" end="00:38:19.240" style="s2">the second is do you have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.779" end="00:38:20.829" style="s2">to do the job or to learn how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.240" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">you could talk to someone about that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.829" end="00:38:25.210" style="s2">then the third thing is have you given</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:27.279" style="s2">yourself enough time to adjust because</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.210" end="00:38:28.269" style="s2">one of the things I often recommend to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.279" end="00:38:30.519" style="s2">people when they&#39;ve made a radical</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.269" end="00:38:32.349" style="s2">change like going leaving home and going</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.519" end="00:38:35.079" style="s2">to university is don&#39;t pay any attention</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.349" end="00:38:37.089" style="s2">to how you feel for a year because</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.079" end="00:38:38.759" style="s2">everything is so much up in the air that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.089" end="00:38:41.410" style="s2">you can&#39;t really trust your own judgment</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.759" end="00:38:44.470" style="s2">so you have to give yourself time to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.410" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">adapt and you can&#39;t expect that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.470" end="00:38:48.339" style="s2">going to happen overnight it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">not and to put that expectation on</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.339" end="00:38:53.640" style="s2">yourself increases the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:53.640" style="s2">you&#39;re going to feel bad about it so</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.119" end="00:38:57.299" style="s2">let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.869" end="00:39:02.740" style="s2">atomic Carlos says my IQ is north of</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.670" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">1:30 yet I question my own intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.740" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">all the time I feel big cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:09.220" style="s2">dissonance between what people expect of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:12.099" style="s2">me and what I consider myself capable to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.220" end="00:39:14.170" style="s2">do well you know Carlos what I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.099" end="00:39:15.579" style="s2">recommend there is that if if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.170" end="00:39:17.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t done it just go do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.579" end="00:39:19.559" style="s2">personality test that understand myself</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.230" end="00:39:22.809" style="s2">calm because what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.559" end="00:39:25.269" style="s2">sounds very much like high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.809" end="00:39:27.039" style="s2">negative emotionality or neuroticism and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.269" end="00:39:29.470" style="s2">you might want to find out if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.039" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">case because if you&#39;re much higher than</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.470" end="00:39:33.849" style="s2">average in neuroticism then you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:35.410" style="s2">to be questioning yourself all the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.849" end="00:39:38.019" style="s2">and you might want to figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.410" end="00:39:39.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a trait and if it is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.019" end="00:39:40.869" style="s2">trait well then that gives you an</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.400" end="00:39:43.900" style="s2">explanation of it and then you might</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.869" end="00:39:46.359" style="s2">also note that your levels of negative</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.900" end="00:39:48.940" style="s2">emotion are not well matched to your</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.359" end="00:39:51.130" style="s2">likely skill now that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.940" end="00:39:53.739" style="s2">necessarily help you learn to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.130" end="00:39:55.029" style="s2">it but sometimes identifying the reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.739" end="00:39:56.890" style="s2">is usefull and there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.029" end="00:39:58.509" style="s2">possibility - is that your mood is</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.890" end="00:40:01.739" style="s2">dysregulated and that you&#39;re depressed</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.509" end="00:40:04.930" style="s2">so that&#39;s another thing to consider if</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.739" end="00:40:06.489" style="s2">you if you do find that you have high</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.930" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">levels of neuroticism but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.489" end="00:40:10.569" style="s2">depressed then one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:12.309" style="s2">might do is write down all the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.569" end="00:40:15.099" style="s2">like really think them out you know I</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.309" end="00:40:17.259" style="s2">mean really get serious about this write</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.099" end="00:40:19.269" style="s2">down all the reasons why you might give</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.259" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">yourself more credit for intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.269" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">than you have and part about could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:26.590" style="s2">like a really deep reconsideration of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:30.010" style="s2">successes you&#39;ve had in the past with</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.590" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">complex intellectual issues because</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.010" end="00:40:33.700" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re serving as your own</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">defense attorney against a very critical</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.700" end="00:40:38.340" style="s2">part of your mind that can help a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:40.840" style="s2">that can help</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.340" end="00:40:41.800" style="s2">Marlene [ __ ] says my little girl loves</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.840" end="00:40:45.040" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.800" end="00:40:49.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s good I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.040" end="00:40:54.369" style="s2">could say hi to her for me I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.720" end="00:40:56.530" style="s2">she has a great little life so give her</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.369" end="00:40:58.869" style="s2">a pat on the head and tell her that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.530" end="00:41:02.609" style="s2">think that little kids are the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.869" end="00:41:02.609" style="s2">thing on earth so</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.270" end="00:41:19.600" style="s2">that cognizant of the modern art scene</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.550" end="00:41:25.390" style="s2">so it isn&#39;t easy to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.600" end="00:41:27.430" style="s2">how to answer that question so I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.390" end="00:41:29.080" style="s2">been thinking also about art for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.430" end="00:41:30.750" style="s2">long time because I&#39;ve been so engaged</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.080" end="00:41:33.940" style="s2">in all this political and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.750" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">material so but music as far as music</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.940" end="00:41:43.180" style="s2">goes I really like the last recordings</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:47.020" style="s2">of Johnny Cash who else springs to mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.180" end="00:41:51.510" style="s2">I like a very large variety of a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.950" end="00:42:11.770" style="s2">for agreeableness yeah well it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:14.110" style="s2">91 and 1 aren&#39;t ordinary numbers they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.840" end="00:42:58.510" style="s2">proper literature you&#39;d look up how to</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:08.290" style="s2">the percentiles into z-scores you some</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.580" end="00:43:10.210" style="s2">the z-scores and then you re convert</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.290" end="00:43:13.450" style="s2">them into percentiles and so if you take</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.210" end="00:43:16.150" style="s2">the z-score for naught for compassion 91</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.450" end="00:43:18.280" style="s2">and the z-score for politeness 1 add</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.150" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">them divide them into Andry convert them</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.280" end="00:43:22.010" style="s2">to a percentile you&#39;ll get 35 I know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s weird but that&#39;s that&#39;s how it</p>

<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:52.130" style="s2">towards cops lately</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.820" end="00:43:56.530" style="s2">maybe maybe majoring in law and grad</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.130" end="00:43:59.930" style="s2">school instead advice please Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.530" end="00:44:01.580" style="s2">well if you&#39;re if you&#39;re gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.930" end="00:44:03.950" style="s2">police officer you should be very</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.580" end="00:44:06.980" style="s2">emotionally stable so low in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.950" end="00:44:10.790" style="s2">and very high in conscientiousness if</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.980" end="00:44:12.859" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be a lawyer you better be</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.790" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">very bright first you you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.859" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">extremely bright verbally in particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:19.580" style="s2">you need to be extremely conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:21.410" style="s2">you need to be emotionally stable and</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.580" end="00:44:23.210" style="s2">you need to be fairly disagreeable</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.410" end="00:44:26.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what characterizes lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.210" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re high in openness in creativity</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.359" end="00:44:33.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say I would say neither cop nor</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:36.619" style="s2">law is a good occupation for you so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.080" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t worry about the culture not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.619" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">being too favorable towards cops that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really any worse than</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not as bad as it was in</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.460" end="00:44:47.510" style="s2">the sixties and I don&#39;t think that it&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.510" end="00:44:51.800" style="s2">should let that stop you because you</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.540" end="00:44:53.240" style="s2">know the police have their own</p>

<p begin="00:44:57.530" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">say you should think more about what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.510" end="00:45:04.130" style="s2">want then how other people view the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:06.670" style="s2">occupation I know that&#39;s relevant but</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.130" end="00:45:09.560" style="s2">you should think about what you want and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.670" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">think of see if you can figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.560" end="00:45:12.740" style="s2">the life of a policeman would actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:14.300" style="s2">interest you or the life of a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.740" end="00:45:15.500" style="s2">like lots of people go into law and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.300" end="00:45:18.680" style="s2">don&#39;t like it you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.500" end="00:45:20.660" style="s2">argumentative you have to really be</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.680" end="00:45:22.340" style="s2">literate because there&#39;s so much reading</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.660" end="00:45:23.990" style="s2">and writing you have to be able to write</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.340" end="00:45:26.180" style="s2">you have to be able to lay out clear</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.990" end="00:45:28.310" style="s2">arguments you have to be really orderly</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.180" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">and detail-oriented because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.310" end="00:45:32.510" style="s2">many things to keep track of so you got</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.670" end="00:45:35.569" style="s2">to make sure you got the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.510" end="00:45:38.089" style="s2">temperament for that so you can try the</p>

<p begin="00:45:38.089" end="00:45:43.880" style="s2">myself like I said the good lawyers are</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.849" end="00:45:47.140" style="s2">high in conscientiousness low in</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.880" end="00:45:49.249" style="s2">neuroticism pretty disagreeable and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.140" end="00:45:50.749" style="s2">extraversion helps to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.249" end="00:45:51.999" style="s2">because it makes you better in the court</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.749" end="00:45:55.249" style="s2">and it also makes you better at</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.999" end="00:45:57.499" style="s2">generating sales leads which you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.249" end="00:45:59.749" style="s2">growing your business which is super</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.499" end="00:46:01.940" style="s2">important if you&#39;re a lawyer like lots</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.979" end="00:47:47.930" style="s2">this story so I was walking along the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.719" end="00:47:49.130" style="s2">cliffs near I think it was San Diego</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.930" end="00:47:53.119" style="s2">where la I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.130" end="00:47:55.730" style="s2">I think it&#39;s probably I think it was it</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.119" end="00:47:57.349" style="s2">I think it was San Diego anyways I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.730" end="00:47:59.960" style="s2">walking along there with some friends</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.349" end="00:48:01.670" style="s2">and and a brother of a friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.960" end="00:48:03.529" style="s2">who was quite a tall guy is about six</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.670" end="00:48:05.210" style="s2">foot five something like that and he was</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.529" end="00:48:07.460" style="s2">walking along the path on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.210" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">the cliff kind of sandy and with with</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.460" end="00:48:13.250" style="s2">scrub pine around overlooking the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">Pacific Ocean and it was March I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.250" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">so was warm but not too warm we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:19.609" style="s2">walking along and all of a sudden his</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:23.119" style="s2">little girl who I think was like four or</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.609" end="00:48:25.369" style="s2">five I saw she was walking in front of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.119" end="00:48:26.390" style="s2">him and in front of me and I guess we</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.369" end="00:48:27.950" style="s2">were going round a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.390" end="00:48:30.950" style="s2">corner and all of a sudden she jumped</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.950" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">right up on his shoulders which I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.950" end="00:48:34.640" style="s2">never seen a child do that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:37.099" style="s2">watching you know if you if a cat sleep</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.640" end="00:48:39.710" style="s2">in you and you and you go at it it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.099" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">like jump up and puff out its hair and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.710" end="00:48:43.730" style="s2">can jump straight up well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:46.670" style="s2">this kid did and there was a rattlesnake</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.730" end="00:48:50.029" style="s2">out the side of the of the path now it</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.670" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">was cold which was probably good but you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.029" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">know there&#39;s a guy named uh-oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:59.269" style="s2">oh I carry he wrote a great book on fear</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.079" end="00:49:00.650" style="s2">it&#39;ll come to me it&#39;ll come to me it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.269" end="00:49:04.849" style="s2">book that I should have on my book list</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.650" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">actually and he showed that there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.849" end="00:49:09.769" style="s2">circuits in your brain there reflex</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:12.710" style="s2">circuits so this had been demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.769" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">to some degree much earlier that map so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.710" end="00:49:16.339" style="s2">imagine that a snake is a pattern and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:18.230" style="s2">then imagine that there&#39;s a pattern on</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.339" end="00:49:20.180" style="s2">your retina that constitutes the snake</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.230" end="00:49:22.279" style="s2">and then imagine that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.180" end="00:49:24.619" style="s2">transformed into another pattern which</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.279" end="00:49:27.109" style="s2">is a muscular output pattern and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.619" end="00:49:31.640" style="s2">muscular output pattern is to jump you</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.109" end="00:49:33.859" style="s2">in the air so your eyes make your your</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.640" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">make your muscles move in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.859" end="00:49:37.940" style="s2">way in and that happens before you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:40.009" style="s2">the snake and before you&#39;re afraid and</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.940" end="00:49:41.809" style="s2">the reason for that is that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.009" end="00:49:44.180" style="s2">there are not many neural connections</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.809" end="00:49:46.849" style="s2">between snake detection and leaping in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.180" end="00:49:49.609" style="s2">the air and that&#39;s because if you waited</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.849" end="00:49:51.589" style="s2">to feel fear and waited to see the snake</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.609" end="00:49:53.900" style="s2">that would take between a quarter and</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.589" end="00:49:55.970" style="s2">half a second something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.900" end="00:49:57.799" style="s2">the snake would have already bitten you</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.970" end="00:49:59.720" style="s2">so unless you had those really short</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.799" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">neural pathways that have been conserved</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.720" end="00:50:05.060" style="s2">in the evolutionary process since</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">the beginning of time anything super</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.060" end="00:50:07.430" style="s2">fast and simple would be able to kill</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:10.940" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.430" end="00:50:13.580" style="s2">so now so let&#39;s say that you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.940" end="00:50:15.740" style="s2">encounter something unexpected well</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.580" end="00:50:17.360" style="s2">first you have these bodily reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.740" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">that are really fast and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.360" end="00:50:20.780" style="s2">thing that happens generally speaking is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:22.820" style="s2">that you feel an emotion like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.780" end="00:50:25.100" style="s2">you&#39;re frozen so if you hear a real</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.820" end="00:50:26.600" style="s2">growl behind you you&#39;ll freeze and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.100" end="00:50:30.230" style="s2">you&#39;ll feel fear and that&#39;ll keep you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.600" end="00:50:33.170" style="s2">frozen and so the the fear is a an</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.230" end="00:50:35.990" style="s2">indication of that physiological state</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.170" end="00:50:39.160" style="s2">and then only after that will you start</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.990" end="00:50:42.200" style="s2">to think and strategize and so you need</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.160" end="00:50:44.300" style="s2">reactions at multiple levels of temporal</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.200" end="00:50:46.070" style="s2">resolution in order to keep you safe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.300" end="00:50:48.020" style="s2">the world and the fast reactions are</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.070" end="00:50:49.700" style="s2">muscular and reflexive and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.020" end="00:50:52.190" style="s2">ones generally speaking or something</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.700" end="00:50:54.470" style="s2">like emotions and they&#39;re low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.190" end="00:50:56.330" style="s2">but quick you know like if you&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.470" end="00:50:59.270" style="s2">it means there&#39;s something that may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.330" end="00:51:00.740" style="s2">dangerous it&#39;s vague it&#39;s not till you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.270" end="00:51:02.450" style="s2">explore it that you know exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.740" end="00:51:04.550" style="s2">the danger is but the fear is a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.450" end="00:51:07.810" style="s2">enough initial category so you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.550" end="00:51:10.850" style="s2">think about feelings as instinctual</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.810" end="00:51:13.370" style="s2">categories things to love things to eat</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.850" end="00:51:15.500" style="s2">things to run away from things to run</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.370" end="00:51:17.750" style="s2">towards they&#39;re low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.500" end="00:51:19.460" style="s2">categories and that&#39;s how animals</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:21.050" style="s2">categorize the world they use emotion</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.460" end="00:51:23.390" style="s2">and motivation to categorize the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.050" end="00:51:25.610" style="s2">so we have them to keep ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.390" end="00:51:27.530" style="s2">properly oriented in the world and to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.610" end="00:51:34.190" style="s2">react quickly and so that we can stay</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.530" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2">alive so okay let&#39;s see here what else</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.190" end="00:51:41.560" style="s2">have we got recently I took a job</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:44.180" style="s2">working at a camp with at risk boys</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.560" end="00:51:45.680" style="s2">where well there I will live and work as</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.180" end="00:51:47.420" style="s2">a counselor in a house with the kids</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:53.990" style="s2">any advice for working with young people</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.420" end="00:51:56.540" style="s2">with behavioral issues yeah it depends</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.990" end="00:51:59.240" style="s2">what the behavioral issues are so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.540" end="00:52:01.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know what out risk means but so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.240" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">can&#39;t be too specific but what I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.820" end="00:52:07.370" style="s2">tell you is that almost nothing beats</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">listening you know like take a kid for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.370" end="00:52:10.700" style="s2">walk</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:13.030" style="s2">let him talk like listen to them ask him</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.700" end="00:52:15.500" style="s2">questions you know because most</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.030" end="00:52:16.109" style="s2">disturbed people and maybe even most</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.500" end="00:52:18.239" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.109" end="00:52:21.869" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have anyone they can talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.239" end="00:52:23.940" style="s2">to and they need to talk first of all to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.869" end="00:52:25.650" style="s2">find out that someone actually cares</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.940" end="00:52:27.660" style="s2">enough to listen so it&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.650" end="00:52:29.910" style="s2">validation of the fact that they exist</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.660" end="00:52:32.309" style="s2">and second so that they can sort out</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.910" end="00:52:34.650" style="s2">their own thoughts so as a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.309" end="00:52:36.539" style="s2">counselor the best thing you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.650" end="00:52:38.099" style="s2">listen you don&#39;t want to give advice</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.539" end="00:52:40.140" style="s2">really you know because what you want</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.099" end="00:52:42.359" style="s2">you can ask questions that might lead</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.140" end="00:52:44.729" style="s2">someone in an advisable direction but</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.359" end="00:52:47.009" style="s2">the problem with giving advice is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.729" end="00:52:48.779" style="s2">people are much more likely to remember</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.009" end="00:52:50.969" style="s2">something and to implement it if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.779" end="00:52:52.469" style="s2">thought it up in their own words I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.969" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">that actually produces a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.469" end="00:52:57.150" style="s2">neurological transformation the idea has</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:59.369" style="s2">to be engendered from within it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.150" end="00:53:00.959" style="s2">the prime dicta of of psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.369" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">theory for example and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.959" end="00:53:06.089" style="s2">really good one so yeah when and with</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:08.009" style="s2">regards so Brendon crystal says trippy</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.089" end="00:53:12.959" style="s2">snakes and retinas yeah like it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.009" end="00:53:14.729" style="s2">specific so this woman named no I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.959" end="00:53:17.099" style="s2">probably can&#39;t remember her name II any</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.729" end="00:53:21.660" style="s2">either she she wrote a book about trees</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.099" end="00:53:23.400" style="s2">and serpents she&#39;s a UCLA professor the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.660" end="00:53:25.410" style="s2">fruit the tree and the serpent I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.400" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">it&#39;s called she showed quite clearly</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.410" end="00:53:29.219" style="s2">that not only do our retinas say</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.390" end="00:53:31.289" style="s2">directly detect snakes but they do a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.219" end="00:53:32.940" style="s2">better job in the bottom half of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.289" end="00:53:36.390" style="s2">retina and that we&#39;re really good at</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.940" end="00:53:37.829" style="s2">detecting the camouflage patterns that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.390" end="00:53:39.779" style="s2">are characteristic of snakes - snakes</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.829" end="00:53:41.640" style="s2">have these like diamond patterns which</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.779" end="00:53:43.829" style="s2">are very very rare and we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.640" end="00:53:45.749" style="s2">specialized circuitry for detecting</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.829" end="00:53:48.539" style="s2">those and there was recent research</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.749" end="00:53:50.369" style="s2">conducted that showed that children 6</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.539" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">months old who had never been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.369" end="00:53:54.779" style="s2">anything even resembling a snake had an</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:58.619" style="s2">automatic response to snakes and so it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.779" end="00:54:00.809" style="s2">actually seems to be innate not just not</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.619" end="00:54:04.489" style="s2">just easily learned so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.809" end="00:54:04.489" style="s2">quite interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.060" end="00:54:18.350" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go back to the pigeonhole</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.610" end="00:54:21.430" style="s2">thing here how do you clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.350" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">when your spouse doesn&#39;t share that goal</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.430" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:28.730" style="s2">well that&#39;s another one of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:30.650" style="s2">questions that&#39;s really hard to answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.730" end="00:54:32.570" style="s2">because I don&#39;t have the details you</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.650" end="00:54:35.900" style="s2">know how do you clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.570" end="00:54:39.050" style="s2">what goals does your spouse have that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.900" end="00:54:40.850" style="s2">the first thing I mean do is there some</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.050" end="00:54:42.620" style="s2">commonality I mean it might be maybe</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.850" end="00:54:44.180" style="s2">you&#39;re a spouse is much more disorderly</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.620" end="00:54:46.070" style="s2">than you or less conscientious or</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.180" end="00:54:48.650" style="s2">irritated at you for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.070" end="00:54:53.030" style="s2">reasons you know the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.650" end="00:54:55.340" style="s2">could do is try to lead by example and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.030" end="00:54:57.980" style="s2">see how that works but you may have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.340" end="00:55:01.130" style="s2">argue and fight it out you know break it</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.980" end="00:55:04.070" style="s2">down into subtasks and and see if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.130" end="00:55:06.430" style="s2">can distribute the the tasks and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.070" end="00:55:10.100" style="s2">negotiate you have to negotiate and</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.430" end="00:55:11.660" style="s2">without further information I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.100" end="00:55:13.220" style="s2">much more than that you know you can say</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.660" end="00:55:15.350" style="s2">why you&#39;re doing it what you think the</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.220" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">goal were and goal was and that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.350" end="00:55:18.860" style="s2">like some help and maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:21.080" style="s2">something you could offer in return</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.860" end="00:55:22.370" style="s2">if you can&#39;t negotiate it all with your</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.080" end="00:55:24.470" style="s2">spouse then you have a much broader</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.370" end="00:55:26.270" style="s2">problem then how do you clean your room</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.470" end="00:55:28.100" style="s2">when your spouse doesn&#39;t share that goal</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.270" end="00:55:30.260" style="s2">cuz the real problem would be how do you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.100" end="00:55:32.150" style="s2">learn to negotiate with your spouse I</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.260" end="00:55:34.250" style="s2">could talk about that a little bit I</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.150" end="00:55:36.170" style="s2">mean the first thing that you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.250" end="00:55:40.340" style="s2">if you want to negotiate with someone is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.170" end="00:55:42.740" style="s2">be able to say no the second thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.340" end="00:55:45.650" style="s2">have something to offer the third thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.740" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">is to find out what they want and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.650" end="00:55:50.660" style="s2">know what you want you know because</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:51.980" style="s2">often people especially with people that</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.660" end="00:55:53.990" style="s2">love them they say well if you really</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.980" end="00:55:55.820" style="s2">knew if you really loved me then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.990" end="00:55:58.190" style="s2">know what I want it&#39;s like no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.820" end="00:55:59.840" style="s2">just wrong the person that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.190" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">love with or that living with isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.840" end="00:56:03.500" style="s2">smarter than you and so you pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.660" style="s2">always have to tell people straight out</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.500" end="00:56:07.640" style="s2">what you want and then you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.660" end="00:56:09.050" style="s2">them be really stupid about giving it to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.640" end="00:56:12.290" style="s2">you for quite a while you know so</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.050" end="00:56:14.270" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;ve recommended to my clients</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.290" end="00:56:15.620" style="s2">that they take their wife or husband out</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.270" end="00:56:17.990" style="s2">on a date and of course they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.620" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">skeptical about that and cynical about</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.990" end="00:56:21.830" style="s2">it and then they go on a date and they</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:23.840" style="s2">have a terrible time and they come back</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.830" end="00:56:26.150" style="s2">and say I told you that was a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.840" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">idea and I tell them a lot that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.150" end="00:56:29.330" style="s2">then a you&#39;re not gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:31.220" style="s2">anything romantic with your spouse for</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.330" end="00:56:33.980" style="s2">the next 40 years that&#39;s your plan</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.220" end="00:56:36.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the plan is it it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.980" end="00:56:38.600" style="s2">might have to go out to a movie after</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.740" end="00:56:40.340" style="s2">you have it been good to each other for</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.600" end="00:56:42.890" style="s2">like five years you might have to go out</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.340" end="00:56:45.140" style="s2">to a movie ten times movie and dinners</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.890" end="00:56:47.480" style="s2">say before it starts to become fun again</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.140" end="00:56:50.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s hard to do that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.480" end="00:56:52.900" style="s2">thing right you know people think those</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.180" end="00:56:57.980" style="s2">things are easy and they&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.900" end="00:57:01.340" style="s2">anyways you have to you have to learn to</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.980" end="00:57:05.270" style="s2">negotiate with your spouse and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.340" end="00:57:07.010" style="s2">very difficult thing to do so figuring</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.270" end="00:57:17.900" style="s2">out what you want is a good way to start</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.010" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">so okay what advice would you give the</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.900" end="00:57:22.430" style="s2">parent of an only child well make sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">that the child your child has lots of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.430" end="00:57:27.380" style="s2">time for free play with other kids and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.010" end="00:57:29.390" style="s2">by free play I mean play with no</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.380" end="00:57:32.620" style="s2">electronic gadgets not sitting in front</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.390" end="00:57:36.710" style="s2">of the TV the kids have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.620" end="00:57:39.230" style="s2">learn how to amuse themselves and and to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.710" end="00:57:41.870" style="s2">especially to engage in pretend play say</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.230" end="00:57:45.350" style="s2">if they&#39;re between three and probably 11</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.870" end="00:57:47.660" style="s2">damn near that time with other kids is</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.350" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">extremely important and kids don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.660" end="00:57:51.320" style="s2">enough time for free play so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:54.980" style="s2">I would say is get them around other</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.320" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">kids as much as you can and not under</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.980" end="00:57:58.220" style="s2">situations where the parents are going</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:00.170" style="s2">to just sit them in front of the TV or</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.220" end="00:58:01.400" style="s2">something like that to amuse them so</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.170" end="00:58:03.020" style="s2">they don&#39;t make too much noise</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.400" end="00:58:04.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.020" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">with seeing them and letting them watch</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.250" end="00:58:08.330" style="s2">a movie but there&#39;s nothing wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.650" end="00:58:10.580" style="s2">the movie but there is something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.330" end="00:58:13.100" style="s2">with not giving the kids enough time to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.580" end="00:58:13.880" style="s2">engage in spontaneous play it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.100" end="00:58:18.680" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.880" end="00:58:19.400" style="s2">so how is the grandpa going I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.680" end="00:58:21.650" style="s2">going pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.400" end="00:58:24.530" style="s2">I it&#39;s quite a lot of fun to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.650" end="00:58:28.580" style="s2">little baby around again I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.530" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">like most men I&#39;m somewhat nonplussed</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.580" end="00:58:34.700" style="s2">let&#39;s say by infants it&#39;s easier for me</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">to deal with kids after they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.700" end="00:58:38.470" style="s2">once they get mobile a once I can sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:40.300" style="s2">of throw them around a bit</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.470" end="00:58:44.020" style="s2">or then I know what to do with them once</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.300" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">I can play with them but it&#39;s really fun</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.020" end="00:58:48.340" style="s2">to watch my daughter be a mother she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:51.640" style="s2">really good at it and it&#39;s good to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.340" end="00:58:54.280" style="s2">another young thing in the family and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.640" end="00:58:56.140" style="s2">you know because babies are very they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.280" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">kind of like fire you you can&#39;t help but</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.140" end="00:59:05.470" style="s2">watch them and it&#39;s great it&#39;s great and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.910" end="00:59:07.840" style="s2">she seems healthy and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.470" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">she&#39;s cute as can be of course babies</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.840" end="00:59:15.270" style="s2">are sneaky that way but it&#39;s working so</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:18.070" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s really going well so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.270" end="00:59:20.530" style="s2">constantly cannot verbalize my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.070" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">written and vocal regardless of topic</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.530" end="00:59:24.280" style="s2">and my level of knowledge tips for</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:27.580" style="s2">verbalizing thoughts to get them into</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.280" end="00:59:30.730" style="s2">writing and therefore speech well what I</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.580" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">would say Lauren is do this like read</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.730" end="00:59:38.140" style="s2">something put a decide try to summarize</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:39.820" style="s2">it in writing and talk while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.140" end="00:59:42.369" style="s2">doing it and then write down what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.820" end="00:59:43.750" style="s2">say and don&#39;t edit while you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.369" end="00:59:45.700" style="s2">that see one of the problems that people</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.750" end="00:59:48.580" style="s2">have when they&#39;re trying to write is</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.700" end="00:59:50.380" style="s2">they try to write a good sentence they</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.580" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">not only try to write a sentence but</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.380" end="00:59:53.170" style="s2">they try to write a good sense and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:55.990" style="s2">can&#39;t do that you have to write a</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.170" end="00:59:58.869" style="s2">sentence that&#39;s hard enough and then you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.990" end="01:00:01.630" style="s2">have to edit it so allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.869" end="01:00:04.540" style="s2">write badly I&#39;m dead serious about this</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.630" end="01:00:08.170" style="s2">like write a bad bad bad first draft and</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.540" end="01:00:09.910" style="s2">then edit it if you get rid of 70% of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.170" end="01:00:11.470" style="s2">so what that&#39;s exactly what should</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.910" end="01:00:13.630" style="s2">happen so like if you want to write a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.470" end="01:00:16.060" style="s2">thousand word essay you should start by</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.630" end="01:00:18.070" style="s2">writing a really bad two thousand word</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.060" end="01:00:20.410" style="s2">essay and then you should get rid of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.070" end="01:00:23.740" style="s2">worst 50% you can do that iteratively</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.410" end="01:00:27.220" style="s2">I have a document online it&#39;s it&#39;s if</p>

<p begin="01:01:21.170" end="01:01:28.220" style="s2">could and I don&#39;t think they will I do</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:30.620" style="s2">have it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.220" end="01:01:32.990" style="s2">I do have most of my videos on Vimeo I</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.620" end="01:01:35.000" style="s2">think I haven&#39;t had I did try to do that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.990" end="01:01:37.190" style="s2">I set up an automated service to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.000" end="01:01:39.020" style="s2">duplicate them I&#39;ve never checked to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.190" end="01:01:47.750" style="s2">if it work which is probably stupid but</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.020" end="01:01:50.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve been so overwhelmed with with this</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.750" end="01:01:53.270" style="s2">with with this surreal position that I</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.570" end="01:01:59.540" style="s2">found myself in that I haven&#39;t been able</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.270" end="01:02:01.940" style="s2">to be sufficiently diligent so how to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.540" end="01:02:03.950" style="s2">less afraid of death hmm I have a better</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.940" end="01:02:07.310" style="s2">suggestion you should be more afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.950" end="01:02:11.030" style="s2">not living properly I don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.310" end="01:02:13.820" style="s2">can be less afraid of death exactly but</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.030" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">I think that here&#39;s a hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.820" end="01:02:19.270" style="s2">this is a Socratic hypothesis I write</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:22.460" style="s2">about this in my book too by the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.270" end="01:02:24.980" style="s2">maybe if you live your life thoroughly</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.460" end="01:02:26.870" style="s2">thoroughly right you take use of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.980" end="01:02:28.340" style="s2">Advanta just make use of the advantages</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.870" end="01:02:30.950" style="s2">that are put in front of you make use of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.340" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">your talents say yes to things tell the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.950" end="01:02:37.070" style="s2">truth like stand up and get out it</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">assuming that you can do that you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.070" end="01:02:41.330" style="s2">because some people are very ill and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:44.390" style="s2">hurt and but assuming you can do that I</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.330" end="01:02:47.540" style="s2">think the only way to combat fear of</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.390" end="01:02:49.610" style="s2">death is to live fully and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.540" end="01:02:51.230" style="s2">that might actually work I kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.610" end="01:02:52.880" style="s2">wonder I&#39;ve talked about this with my</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.230" end="01:02:55.250" style="s2">father - who&#39;s getting pretty old you</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.880" end="01:02:57.740" style="s2">know I&#39;ve asked him if for example if he</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.250" end="01:02:59.780" style="s2">could be transformed back into an 18</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.740" end="01:03:02.090" style="s2">year old knowing what he knows now would</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.780" end="01:03:03.560" style="s2">he do it and he was ambivalent about</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.090" end="01:03:06.050" style="s2">that you know he didn&#39;t say no but he</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.560" end="01:03:08.570" style="s2">didn&#39;t say yes and we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.050" end="01:03:12.470" style="s2">this idea that if you lived your life</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.570" end="01:03:14.600" style="s2">fully you know maybe that would be good</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.470" end="01:03:18.680" style="s2">enough because you know I loved having</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.600" end="01:03:22.700" style="s2">kids but I don&#39;t feel that I would have</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.680" end="01:03:24.980" style="s2">kids again you know because in some</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.700" end="01:03:28.640" style="s2">sense I&#39;ve already done that and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.980" end="01:03:30.590" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a set number of adventures</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.640" end="01:03:32.450" style="s2">that you have to go on in your life</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.590" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have to be married you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.450" end="01:03:36.440" style="s2">have to have kids you have to have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:38.330" style="s2">career you have to have friends you have</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.440" end="01:03:40.370" style="s2">to have something useful to do with your</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.330" end="01:03:41.690" style="s2">time outside of work all those are all</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.370" end="01:03:44.000" style="s2">things that are covered in the future</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.690" end="01:03:45.980" style="s2">authoring program by the way maybe if</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.000" end="01:03:47.840" style="s2">you do all those it&#39;s like that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.980" end="01:03:50.990" style="s2">enough you&#39;ve had your life and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.840" end="01:03:52.910" style="s2">that&#39;s enough I mean I don&#39;t know ten</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.990" end="01:03:57.260" style="s2">years ago I thought you know if I could</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.910" end="01:04:01.370" style="s2">extend my life radically then I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.260" end="01:04:05.860" style="s2">and I&#39;m not so sure about that now then</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.370" end="01:04:05.860" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m 55 you know I&#39;m getting older I</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.950" end="01:04:12.170" style="s2">kind of have a suspicion that you might</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.500" end="01:04:14.390" style="s2">come to an end you know that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.170" end="01:04:19.130" style="s2">looks like I mean I don&#39;t want that to</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.390" end="01:04:21.290" style="s2">be soon but maybe you exhaust yourself</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.130" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">in your life you know maybe you can so</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.290" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing left of you really</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.600" end="01:04:33.550" style="s2">it&#39;s a good goal anyways so okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.740" end="01:04:36.530" style="s2">find out let&#39;s go back to this other</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.550" end="01:04:38.300" style="s2">doctor Peterson I have an interview for</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.530" end="01:04:40.940" style="s2">medicine coming up very soon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.300" end="01:04:43.310" style="s2">structured in the MMI format and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.940" end="01:04:49.460" style="s2">intensely competitive any tips on how to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.310" end="01:04:53.570" style="s2">stand out from the rest well the only</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.460" end="01:04:55.970" style="s2">thing I could say is that two things one</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.570" end="01:04:58.370" style="s2">is really pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.970" end="01:04:59.630" style="s2">interviewers right super attention like</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.370" end="01:05:02.570" style="s2">don&#39;t glare at them like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.630" end="01:05:05.390" style="s2">aggressively paranoid but like make sure</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.570" end="01:05:08.150" style="s2">you&#39;re focused on them and then the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.390" end="01:05:08.780" style="s2">other thing I would say is say what you</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.150" end="01:05:12.230" style="s2">really think</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.780" end="01:05:13.610" style="s2">like tell the truth it&#39;ll make you first</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.230" end="01:05:16.130" style="s2">of all if you tell the truth and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.610" end="01:05:18.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work then you know maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.130" end="01:05:20.539" style="s2">not the school for you that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.620" end="01:05:22.279" style="s2">to really think about</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.539" end="01:05:23.989" style="s2">and if it doesn&#39;t work anywhere and you</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.279" end="01:05:25.429" style="s2">tell the truth maybe medicine isn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.989" end="01:05:28.249" style="s2">you and I know that might be a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.429" end="01:05:31.130" style="s2">shock but let&#39;s assume that you are</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.249" end="01:05:33.799" style="s2">genuinely properly motivated to study</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.130" end="01:05:36.319" style="s2">medicine then tell them what you think</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.799" end="01:05:39.139" style="s2">you know so many people when they go</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.319" end="01:05:40.939" style="s2">into an interview try and they do this</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.139" end="01:05:42.859" style="s2">when they write essays to is try to tell</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.939" end="01:05:44.389" style="s2">the interviewers what you think they</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.859" end="01:05:45.859" style="s2">want to hear but you can bloody well be</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.389" end="01:05:49.099" style="s2">sure that virtually everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.859" end="01:05:50.839" style="s2">being interviewed is gonna do that and I</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.099" end="01:05:53.569" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s very advisable</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.839" end="01:05:56.659" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t manifest yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.569" end="01:05:58.819" style="s2">the way you are then there&#39;s no way that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.659" end="01:06:01.009" style="s2">the path that&#39;s proper for you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.819" end="01:06:02.449" style="s2">reveal itself I know that sounds sort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.009" end="01:06:05.569" style="s2">mystical but I don&#39;t know how to put it</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.449" end="01:06:08.599" style="s2">any better the best way to stand out in</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.569" end="01:06:09.799" style="s2">an interview always assuming you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.599" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">competent and that you&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.799" end="01:06:14.209" style="s2">preparation you know and that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:17.419" style="s2">living a lie is to actually say what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.209" end="01:06:19.999" style="s2">think and hopefully what will happen is</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.419" end="01:06:21.829" style="s2">that there will be other people on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.999" end="01:06:25.009" style="s2">panel that&#39;s that&#39;s that are looking at</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.829" end="01:06:27.409" style="s2">you who are of the same type and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.009" end="01:06:28.759" style="s2">would characterize a good position for</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.409" end="01:06:30.829" style="s2">you a good place to be if there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.759" end="01:06:33.049" style="s2">people like that and they&#39;ll note what</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.829" end="01:06:34.880" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and that will that would</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.049" end="01:06:37.099" style="s2">then they&#39;ll think you know that person</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.880" end="01:06:38.869" style="s2">you know they&#39;re there they&#39;d be good</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.099" end="01:06:41.479" style="s2">they&#39;re straightforward they&#39;re honest</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.869" end="01:06:43.609" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re tough they&#39;re they can</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.479" end="01:06:45.109" style="s2">say what they think and if there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.609" end="01:06:46.339" style="s2">people like that on the panel then I</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.109" end="01:06:48.769" style="s2">would say you probably don&#39;t want to go</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.339" end="01:06:51.979" style="s2">there anyways so that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.769" end="01:06:53.809" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would do the true to</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.979" end="01:06:56.329" style="s2">yourself you know but that also assumes</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.809" end="01:06:57.799" style="s2">that you&#39;ve done your homework and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.329" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">you&#39;re prepared and all of that because</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.799" end="01:07:02.029" style="s2">if you&#39;re a useless jackass and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:05.689" style="s2">yourself well obviously that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.029" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">work so good luck good luck with your</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.689" end="01:07:09.409" style="s2">interview</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:10.789" style="s2">but I always think that like the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.409" end="01:07:13.669" style="s2">thing too is don&#39;t treat the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.789" end="01:07:15.709" style="s2">interviewers as enemies you know if</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.669" end="01:07:17.929" style="s2">that&#39;s hard because if you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.709" end="01:07:20.659" style="s2">petrified about the potential outcome</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.929" end="01:07:22.189" style="s2">and you feel intense judgement then</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.659" end="01:07:25.189" style="s2">you&#39;re likely to go in there kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.189" end="01:07:29.809" style="s2">afraid and nervous and and and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.189" end="01:07:31.309" style="s2">even resentful it&#39;s like you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.809" end="01:07:33.290" style="s2">done enough so that you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.309" end="01:07:35.000" style="s2">interviewed so</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.290" end="01:07:36.710" style="s2">in some sense the interviewers are</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.000" end="01:07:38.810" style="s2">hoping that you&#39;ll be great</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.710" end="01:07:40.190" style="s2">already you know there might be the odd</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.810" end="01:07:43.100" style="s2">cynic in there who&#39;s trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.190" end="01:07:46.160" style="s2">out a reason to give you an X and check</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.100" end="01:07:47.480" style="s2">you off the list but most of the people</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.160" end="01:07:49.790" style="s2">sitting there if they have a clue are</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.480" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">going to be looking for good candidates</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.790" end="01:07:54.020" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna assume that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:07:54.020" end="01:07:57.590" style="s2">like they&#39;re not on your side and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.210" end="01:07:59.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to keep in mind too</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.590" end="01:08:02.810" style="s2">you&#39;re not going in there to face a</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.600" end="01:08:04.940" style="s2">panel of enemies you&#39;re going in there</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.810" end="01:08:07.130" style="s2">to face a panel of the sort of people</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.940" end="01:08:08.330" style="s2">that you&#39;re likely to be in ten years so</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.130" end="01:08:10.070" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.330" end="01:08:15.350" style="s2">useful to keep in mind with interviews</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.070" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">in general I would say so okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.350" end="01:08:19.609" style="s2">many of my friends sing the wonders of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:22.700" style="s2">diversity I try to tell them diversity</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.609" end="01:08:24.290" style="s2">isn&#39;t a moral good but I end up looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.700" end="01:08:26.359" style="s2">like some terrible racist why isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.290" end="01:08:30.049" style="s2">diversity a moral good well diversity is</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.359" end="01:08:32.210" style="s2">a moral good but you can&#39;t diversity by</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.049" end="01:08:34.549" style="s2">race doesn&#39;t produce diversity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.210" end="01:08:36.770" style="s2">that&#39;s called racism that idea or</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.549" end="01:08:38.420" style="s2">diversity of gender doesn&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.770" end="01:08:42.560" style="s2">diversity unless that&#39;s how you define</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.420" end="01:08:44.540" style="s2">diversity look let&#39;s say that you get</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.560" end="01:08:46.940" style="s2">diversity partly as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.540" end="01:08:49.609" style="s2">personality which is a good way of</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.940" end="01:08:53.180" style="s2">looking at it there is more diversity</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.609" end="01:08:55.370" style="s2">within groups of people than between so</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.180" end="01:08:57.049" style="s2">like men and women differ to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.370" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">in their personalities but there&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.049" end="01:09:01.850" style="s2">more difference between men within the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.230" style="s2">male group and women within the male</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.850" end="01:09:06.710" style="s2">group than there is between the average</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.230" end="01:09:08.660" style="s2">or typical male and female so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.710" end="01:09:11.990" style="s2">stupid wait let&#39;s assume that what you</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.660" end="01:09:14.810" style="s2">want the organization is pursuing a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.990" end="01:09:17.240" style="s2">complex goal and you want a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.810" end="01:09:19.640" style="s2">skills that would be suited to that goal</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.240" end="01:09:22.580" style="s2">then you want there to be enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.640" end="01:09:24.620" style="s2">diversity of ability within the group so</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.580" end="01:09:29.120" style="s2">that the goal can be achieved in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.620" end="01:09:32.770" style="s2">efficient and and and inexpensive manner</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.120" end="01:09:34.910" style="s2">right because what do you want</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.770" end="01:09:39.140" style="s2">unofficial tanned expensive obviously</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.910" end="01:09:41.960" style="s2">not so there&#39;s a presumption that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.140" end="01:09:43.730" style="s2">get diversity by using identity politics</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.960" end="01:09:47.500" style="s2">categories but there&#39;s absolutely no</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.730" end="01:09:51.109" style="s2">evidence for that whatsoever so</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.500" end="01:09:54.259" style="s2">that&#39;s why diversity defined by race or</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.109" end="01:09:56.500" style="s2">ethnicity or gender is not only not a</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.259" end="01:09:59.270" style="s2">moral good it&#39;s actually a moral evil</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.500" end="01:10:01.190" style="s2">because it dispenses with the whole idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.270" end="01:10:03.500" style="s2">of the individual dispenses with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.190" end="01:10:05.840" style="s2">idea of competence it just replaces it</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.500" end="01:10:07.580" style="s2">with the assumption that if you randomly</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:09.950" style="s2">select from the population because</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.580" end="01:10:12.230" style="s2">that&#39;s how you would get real equity you</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.950" end="01:10:14.390" style="s2">randomly select from the population that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.230" end="01:10:17.150" style="s2">that gives you the best qualified group</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.390" end="01:10:18.740" style="s2">of people well that&#39;s just that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.150" end="01:10:20.810" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do that to select the Plumber</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.740" end="01:10:23.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the stupidest possible way of</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.810" end="01:10:25.760" style="s2">selecting for anything randomly you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.930" end="01:10:28.850" style="s2">there&#39;s no difference between selecting</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:33.410" style="s2">randomly and selecting accidentally so</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.850" end="01:10:35.900" style="s2">it&#39;s moral diversity defined properly is</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.410" end="01:10:38.300" style="s2">a moral good diversity based on identity</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.900" end="01:10:41.540" style="s2">politics categories is a positive evil</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.300" end="01:10:43.250" style="s2">you know true to our prime ministers</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.540" end="01:10:47.030" style="s2">great example of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.250" end="01:10:48.740" style="s2">so back I think it was in 2015 he</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.030" end="01:10:51.290" style="s2">announced that half of his cabinet was</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.740" end="01:10:54.260" style="s2">going to be women because it was 2015 or</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.290" end="01:10:57.740" style="s2">some like muddle-headed virtue Signori</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.260" end="01:11:01.670" style="s2">signaling excuse for not thinking I</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.740" end="01:11:04.250" style="s2">think only 20% or 25% of the elected MPs</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.670" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">were female so the proper balance on</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.250" end="01:11:09.380" style="s2">average would it be 25 percent female 75</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:12.620" style="s2">percent male what he should have done</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.380" end="01:11:14.930" style="s2">was figured out who what qualities would</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.620" end="01:11:16.670" style="s2">make for a confident cabinet minister</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.930" end="01:11:18.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s actually quite important to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.670" end="01:11:21.920" style="s2">have competent cabinet ministers and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.440" end="01:11:24.350" style="s2">then selected from among his people for</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.920" end="01:11:26.390" style="s2">nothing other than competence but he</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.350" end="01:11:28.280" style="s2">could virtue signal and then he set up</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.390" end="01:11:31.580" style="s2">the most important board let&#39;s say of</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.280" end="01:11:32.240" style="s2">the entire country on a quasi random</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.580" end="01:11:34.850" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.240" end="01:11:38.240" style="s2">Jesus how pathetic he should have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.850" end="01:11:40.670" style="s2">pilloried by Canadians for that but</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.240" end="01:11:42.350" style="s2">we&#39;re so clued out and and also in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.670" end="01:11:45.260" style="s2">situation that you described it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.350" end="01:11:47.780" style="s2">if I say well 50% of Trudeau&#39;s cabinet</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.260" end="01:11:50.120" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have been women it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.780" end="01:11:53.090" style="s2">you&#39;re a misogynist it&#39;s like no only</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.120" end="01:11:54.590" style="s2">25% of the elected officials were women</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.090" end="01:11:56.930" style="s2">now you might say well it would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.590" end="01:11:58.940" style="s2">better if 50% of them were elected it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.930" end="01:11:59.930" style="s2">like maybe it would be better but it</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.940" end="01:12:03.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.930" end="01:12:05.600" style="s2">so you can&#39;t you can&#39;t fix it at the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.260" end="01:12:08.060" style="s2">top-end it was appalling</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.600" end="01:12:11.270" style="s2">so it&#39;s a hard argument to make you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.060" end="01:12:12.770" style="s2">because you need to know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.270" end="01:12:14.450" style="s2">more difference within groups than</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.770" end="01:12:16.940" style="s2">between them in order to be able to come</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.450" end="01:12:22.310" style="s2">up with a credible argument you know and</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.940" end="01:12:23.750" style="s2">then so yeah yeah how does one</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.310" end="01:12:26.180" style="s2">distinguish a statement coming from</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.750" end="01:12:28.910" style="s2">oneself rather than from ideology hey I</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.180" end="01:12:31.670" style="s2">got a good hint about that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.910" end="01:12:34.550" style="s2">saying something that almost anyone else</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.670" end="01:12:38.330" style="s2">could say then it&#39;s likely to be either</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.550" end="01:12:40.190" style="s2">cliched or ideological where is if</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.330" end="01:12:42.590" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking from yourself then in</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.190" end="01:12:44.480" style="s2">some sense you&#39;re the only person who</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.590" end="01:12:46.220" style="s2">could be saying that and so what that</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.480" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">means in some sense is that you&#39;ve taken</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.220" end="01:12:52.970" style="s2">ideas philosophical even ideological and</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:55.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve made them personal so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.970" end="01:12:56.720" style="s2">speaking from a position that only you</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.070" end="01:12:59.420" style="s2">can speak from and then then you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.720" end="01:13:01.400" style="s2">something original to offer in</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.420" end="01:13:03.860" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn school like archipelago he</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.400" end="01:13:05.750" style="s2">talked about like radical communists who</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.860" end="01:13:08.150" style="s2">were thrown into the gulag and they used</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.750" end="01:13:10.370" style="s2">to play comrade with them it was a game</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.150" end="01:13:13.160" style="s2">and what they would do is bait them into</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.370" end="01:13:15.590" style="s2">making continual propagandistic</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.160" end="01:13:17.140" style="s2">communist statements was an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.590" end="01:13:20.750" style="s2">try to educate them out of their</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.140" end="01:13:22.490" style="s2">possession but it&#39;s a good see if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.750" end="01:13:24.740" style="s2">can predict what someone is going to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.490" end="01:13:27.890" style="s2">on the basis of their set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.740" end="01:13:29.360" style="s2">then they&#39;re not speaking the ideology</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.890" end="01:13:30.620" style="s2">is speaking and if the ideology is</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.360" end="01:13:31.790" style="s2">speaking you don&#39;t even have to listen</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.620" end="01:13:34.250" style="s2">to them you could just read about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.790" end="01:13:36.920" style="s2">ideology and make up your own mind now</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.250" end="01:13:40.610" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the what would</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.920" end="01:13:42.520" style="s2">you call it that&#39;s the objective view of</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.610" end="01:13:45.050" style="s2">this the subjective view is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.520" end="01:13:46.520" style="s2">statements come from yourself that come</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.050" end="01:13:47.780" style="s2">from yourself I think first of all</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.520" end="01:13:49.700" style="s2">frightened you to some degree because</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.780" end="01:13:52.250" style="s2">you actually open yourself up to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.700" end="01:13:55.490" style="s2">world by saying something genuine but</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.250" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">they also make you stronger they make</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.490" end="01:13:59.090" style="s2">you feel stronger but because I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:01.730" style="s2">you&#39;re confronting your vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.090" end="01:14:03.050" style="s2">properly you know because if I tell you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.730" end="01:14:05.060" style="s2">something that I really don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.050" end="01:14:07.100" style="s2">and you criticize it&#39;s like who cares</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.060" end="01:14:08.870" style="s2">because I don&#39;t really believe it</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.100" end="01:14:11.450" style="s2">anyways so maybe I have an ideology</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.870" end="01:14:13.230" style="s2">that&#39;s like a mask or a persona which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.450" end="01:14:15.390" style="s2">generally the case</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.230" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">sona&#39;s a union concept that means masks</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.390" end="01:14:19.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s often the thing that people</p>

<p begin="01:15:55.179" end="01:15:58.239" style="s2">these scores well okay so the first</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.649" end="01:16:00.489" style="s2">thing David you might want to think</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.239" end="01:16:02.889" style="s2">about is like if all of your scores were</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.489" end="01:16:04.329" style="s2">low then there&#39;s some possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.889" end="01:16:05.919" style="s2">you&#39;re being too hard on yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.329" end="01:16:08.649" style="s2">what I would recommend then is get a</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.919" end="01:16:11.530" style="s2">couple of friends to fill out the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.649" end="01:16:14.169" style="s2">questionnaire for for you to describe</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.530" end="01:16:15.639" style="s2">you and then see if first of all if</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.169" end="01:16:17.379" style="s2">there&#39;s any agreement see if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.639" end="01:16:20.919" style="s2">they are easier on you than you are</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.379" end="01:16:22.659" style="s2">yourself so but let&#39;s assume that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.919" end="01:16:24.159" style="s2">are rather low in conscientiousness the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.659" end="01:16:25.899" style="s2">next question would be well how young</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.159" end="01:16:27.519" style="s2">are you because younger people tend to</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.899" end="01:16:30.070" style="s2">be lower in conscientiousness so if</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.519" end="01:16:32.530" style="s2">you&#39;re like 16 well that&#39;s low but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.070" end="01:16:34.629" style="s2">not catastrophic if you&#39;re like 40 and</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.530" end="01:16:39.159" style="s2">you&#39;re not depressed then 0th is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.629" end="01:16:40.839" style="s2">know that&#39;s low anyways if you are that</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.159" end="01:16:43.809" style="s2">low in conscientiousness one of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.839" end="01:16:47.050" style="s2">things I would recommend is a make a</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.809" end="01:16:49.119" style="s2">plan and B learn how to use a schedule a</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.050" end="01:16:50.739" style="s2">calendar and do it badly to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.119" end="01:16:52.659" style="s2">like an electronic calendar like Google</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.739" end="01:16:54.729" style="s2">Calendar that&#39;s the best thing I know of</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.659" end="01:16:57.280" style="s2">to improve conscientiousness make a plan</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.729" end="01:17:01.539" style="s2">so that you&#39;ve got something to aim at</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:04.780" style="s2">and use a scheduler and maybe you have</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.539" end="01:17:07.030" style="s2">to you know talk to someone to help keep</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.780" end="01:17:09.249" style="s2">you on track now the other question</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.030" end="01:17:10.689" style="s2">would be do you have other personality</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.249" end="01:17:12.459" style="s2">traits that are really high like</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.689" end="01:17:14.409" style="s2">openness because if you&#39;re really high</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.459" end="01:17:16.780" style="s2">and openness then it might be that</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.409" end="01:17:19.179" style="s2">you&#39;re more inclined towards being</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.780" end="01:17:20.949" style="s2">motivated by spontaneous interest and in</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.179" end="01:17:22.239" style="s2">the artistic direction and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.949" end="01:17:23.439" style="s2">really high an extraversion then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.239" end="01:17:26.469" style="s2">going to be motivated by being around</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.439" end="01:17:28.269" style="s2">people you know so it also may be that</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.469" end="01:17:30.070" style="s2">in order to be conscientious about</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.269" end="01:17:32.229" style="s2">something you have to pick a domain that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.070" end="01:17:34.899" style="s2">you&#39;re suited to like socializing or</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.229" end="01:17:37.570" style="s2">artistic endeavor and try to work on</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.899" end="01:17:42.300" style="s2">being conscientious in those domains so</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.570" end="01:17:42.300" style="s2">that&#39;s it so</p>

<p begin="01:24:06.140" end="01:24:11.390" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of surprised that people want</p>

<p begin="01:24:11.390" end="01:24:14.930" style="s2">kind of scratchy at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.770" end="01:24:17.930" style="s2">but I&#39;m looking forward to it I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:24:17.930" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">her to sleep at night hopefully that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.090" end="01:24:28.930" style="s2">not because of the book she does get</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:28.930" style="s2">quite tired at night so let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.050" end="01:24:33.500" style="s2">would you ever consider having a dialog</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.580" end="01:24:35.540" style="s2">with legitimate Muslim scholar yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.500" end="01:24:37.420" style="s2">absolutely and I know a number of them</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.540" end="01:24:41.150" style="s2">and I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;ll get to that</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.420" end="01:24:43.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a big thing to take on you know and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.150" end="01:24:45.200" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to deal with this biblical</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.010" end="01:24:46.490" style="s2">lecture series and with well all the</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.200" end="01:24:49.100" style="s2">other things that I&#39;m involved in</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.490" end="01:24:50.870" style="s2">including starting to lay the groundwork</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.100" end="01:24:53.210" style="s2">for this online university which is</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.870" end="01:24:55.610" style="s2">which and I&#39;ve started looking for an</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.210" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">office where a team could work on that</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.610" end="01:25:00.200" style="s2">and we&#39;ve sketched out some of the ideas</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:02.510" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use competitive writing</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.200" end="01:25:04.130" style="s2">exercises to help teach people to write</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.510" end="01:25:09.560" style="s2">which I think would really be fun so one</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.130" end="01:25:10.880" style="s2">idea is so imagine and remember this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.560" end="01:25:12.380" style="s2">just the outline of idea imagine we</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.880" end="01:25:14.960" style="s2">present you with a paragraph that</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.380" end="01:25:16.580" style="s2">someone else wrote and then you have the</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.960" end="01:25:17.870" style="s2">opportunity to do a better job of</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.580" end="01:25:19.730" style="s2">writing it and then people get the</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.870" end="01:25:21.680" style="s2">opportunity to vote on whose is better</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.730" end="01:25:23.540" style="s2">you can see that the paragraphs could</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.680" end="01:25:25.250" style="s2">compete and that you could get academic</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.540" end="01:25:30.290" style="s2">points based on the quality of your</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.250" end="01:25:32.090" style="s2">writing anyways that&#39;s all to say</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.290" end="01:25:33.350" style="s2">especially also with this book coming</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.090" end="01:25:40.060" style="s2">out is that I&#39;m going to be very</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.350" end="01:25:43.250" style="s2">occupied and I want to start a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.060" end="01:25:44.420" style="s2">with legitimate Muslim scholars because</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.250" end="01:25:48.430" style="s2">I would also like to learn more about</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.420" end="01:25:50.250" style="s2">Islam so hopefully that&#39;ll happen in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.430" end="01:25:53.480" style="s2">in that relatively</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.250" end="01:25:53.480" style="s2">your future so</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.760" end="01:26:12.300" style="s2">Jake says I&#39;ve been incredibly inspired</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.860" end="01:26:13.949" style="s2">by you love what you do and would like</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.300" end="01:26:15.959" style="s2">to enlighten people in a similar manner</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.949" end="01:26:18.119" style="s2">be careful what you wish for</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.959" end="01:26:23.209" style="s2">it is is it appropriate to aim to have</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.119" end="01:26:27.150" style="s2">as much as an impact as you or more so I</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.209" end="01:26:33.090" style="s2">think it&#39;s the ideas formulated wrong in</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.150" end="01:26:37.429" style="s2">some sense I think I mean it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.090" end="01:26:41.010" style="s2">have people that you admire let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.429" end="01:26:43.409" style="s2">who can serve as models and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.010" end="01:26:44.789" style="s2">claiming that I&#39;m necessarily in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.409" end="01:26:47.789" style="s2">category but it&#39;s good to have people</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.789" end="01:26:50.309" style="s2">like that but what you want to figure</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.789" end="01:26:52.380" style="s2">out to do to do to do is how to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.309" end="01:26:53.909" style="s2">the ideal within the confines of your</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.380" end="01:26:56.969" style="s2">own life right because you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.909" end="01:26:59.159" style="s2">particular sort of person and so the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.969" end="01:27:01.849" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to live your life best</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.159" end="01:27:04.499" style="s2">it&#39;s very unlikely that it would be</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.849" end="01:27:06.179" style="s2">associated in any important way with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.499" end="01:27:08.190" style="s2">way that I&#39;ve chosen to live my life be</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.179" end="01:27:09.809" style="s2">unless we have very similar temperaments</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.190" end="01:27:13.650" style="s2">which is possible but you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.809" end="01:27:14.880" style="s2">relatively unlikely because the odds</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.650" end="01:27:19.800" style="s2">against that are it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.880" end="01:27:21.360" style="s2">extraordinarily high the odds of any two</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.800" end="01:27:25.409" style="s2">people having the same temperament are</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.360" end="01:27:30.059" style="s2">very are very high so what you can do is</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.409" end="01:27:31.829" style="s2">aim to to orient yourself towards a high</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.059" end="01:27:33.479" style="s2">good that you can conceive up to</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.829" end="01:27:34.920" style="s2">discipline yourself to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.479" end="01:27:37.199" style="s2">and all of that and then what I would</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.920" end="01:27:38.999" style="s2">say is that as your life unfolds you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.199" end="01:27:41.249" style="s2">have the amount of influence that you</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.999" end="01:27:44.459" style="s2">should have whatever that happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.249" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">you know some people live pretty local</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.459" end="01:27:50.969" style="s2">lives like my life for example is much</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:52.829" style="s2">more public than my wife&#39;s life but that</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.969" end="01:27:54.659" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that her contribution is</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.829" end="01:27:56.489" style="s2">somehow lesser I mean she&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.659" end="01:27:58.440" style="s2">unbelievably good with her kids my</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.489" end="01:28:00.539" style="s2">daughter was very ill and my wife was</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.440" end="01:28:03.030" style="s2">extraordinarily good with her and was a</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.539" end="01:28:05.039" style="s2">great mother and it&#39;s been a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.030" end="01:28:07.650" style="s2">help to me as a very honest person and a</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.039" end="01:28:09.809" style="s2">wise person and you know that all has an</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.650" end="01:28:11.519" style="s2">impact it&#39;s just not as obvious because</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.809" end="01:28:13.289" style="s2">well the kids really loved her and now</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.519" end="01:28:15.090" style="s2">she&#39;s got grandkids and god only knows</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.289" end="01:28:18.869" style="s2">what the consequence of that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.090" end="01:28:20.459" style="s2">be across successive generations and you</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.869" end="01:28:22.030" style="s2">know she isn&#39;t interested in the public</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.459" end="01:28:23.980" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.030" end="01:28:25.570" style="s2">journalists have asked interviewer like</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.980" end="01:28:27.610" style="s2">quite recently about what the last</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.570" end="01:28:31.810" style="s2">year&#39;s been like and her preference is</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.610" end="01:28:34.030" style="s2">to not do that and and that&#39;s fine like</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.810" end="01:28:36.100" style="s2">she has her own destiny and and her own</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.030" end="01:28:38.560" style="s2">way of being in the world and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.100" end="01:28:39.940" style="s2">nothing to say that it&#39;s lesser in any</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.560" end="01:28:43.660" style="s2">sense of the word at all</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.940" end="01:28:45.190" style="s2">so should artists waste their time in</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.660" end="01:28:49.210" style="s2">art school no you shouldn&#39;t waste your</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.190" end="01:28:51.730" style="s2">time ever I think your question is is it</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.210" end="01:28:54.430" style="s2">necessarily a waste of time to go to art</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.730" end="01:28:57.100" style="s2">school and I would say it depends very</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.430" end="01:29:01.750" style="s2">much on the art school and on what you</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.100" end="01:29:04.390" style="s2">do while you&#39;re there if you go to art</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.750" end="01:29:06.430" style="s2">school and you really work at it like</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.390" end="01:29:07.450" style="s2">mad and you devote yourself to it and</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.430" end="01:29:09.520" style="s2">you&#39;re in the library and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.450" end="01:29:11.380" style="s2">studying the great masters and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.520" end="01:29:12.820" style="s2">crafting your technique and you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.380" end="01:29:16.390" style="s2">school where that&#39;s actually possible</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.820" end="01:29:17.860" style="s2">then you can educate yourself and going</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.390" end="01:29:20.890" style="s2">to art school can give you an identity</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.860" end="01:29:24.220" style="s2">that allows you to investigate that</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.890" end="01:29:26.170" style="s2">possibility free from undue social</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.220" end="01:29:28.090" style="s2">pressure for some period of time which</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.170" end="01:29:31.180" style="s2">is really the case with a an arts degree</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.090" end="01:29:33.730" style="s2">or something like that as well so if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.180" end="01:29:35.770" style="s2">can take advantage of it if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.730" end="01:29:38.670" style="s2">disciplined enough and if you can find a</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.770" end="01:29:41.470" style="s2">school that isn&#39;t completely appallingly</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.670" end="01:29:43.960" style="s2">postmodern and and social justice</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.470" end="01:29:45.790" style="s2">oriented instead of oriented towards art</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.960" end="01:29:47.530" style="s2">then I don&#39;t think it has to be a waste</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.790" end="01:29:54.970" style="s2">of time but I think there&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.530" end="01:29:56.800" style="s2">probability that it will so serious</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.970" end="01:29:58.510" style="s2">respectful question why did you have a</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.800" end="01:30:00.250" style="s2">problem with Lindsay Shepard being</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.510" end="01:30:02.470" style="s2">criticized for being non-critical but</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.250" end="01:30:07.960" style="s2">you criticized faith Goldie for being</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.470" end="01:30:11.490" style="s2">non-critical well the fundamental issue</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.960" end="01:30:14.470" style="s2">I really listened carefully to faiths</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.490" end="01:30:16.240" style="s2">interview the the interview that was</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.470" end="01:30:17.740" style="s2">conducted I think with the daily stormer</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.240" end="01:30:19.390" style="s2">I really listened to it and I sat down</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.740" end="01:30:24.940" style="s2">and listened to it with my son whose</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.390" end="01:30:26.590" style="s2">judgment I respect a lot and the thing</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.940" end="01:30:30.010" style="s2">that differentiates the two is that</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.590" end="01:30:33.730" style="s2">faith is a journalist and my sense was</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.010" end="01:30:34.900" style="s2">that in this situation that she found</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.730" end="01:30:38.500" style="s2">herself</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.900" end="01:30:42.790" style="s2">it was incumbent on her as a journalist</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.500" end="01:30:45.159" style="s2">to ask at least one or two probing</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.790" end="01:30:47.260" style="s2">questions given the nature of the people</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.159" end="01:30:48.730" style="s2">the known nature and the fact that she</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.260" end="01:30:51.820" style="s2">knew the nature of the people that she</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.730" end="01:30:54.580" style="s2">was talking to and I don&#39;t feel that she</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.820" end="01:30:56.920" style="s2">did it and you know I was obviously not</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.580" end="01:30:58.900" style="s2">alone in my assessment of that so her</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.920" end="01:31:00.969" style="s2">employer who was very favorably</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.900" end="01:31:04.330" style="s2">predisposed towards her also let her go</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.969" end="01:31:06.130" style="s2">as a consequence of that and so I know</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.330" end="01:31:08.020" style="s2">that and I&#39;ve been accused of being</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.130" end="01:31:10.150" style="s2">hypocritical as a consequence and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.020" end="01:31:13.420" style="s2">should also say that the decision to</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.150" end="01:31:16.300" style="s2">restructure the panel wasn&#39;t mine alone</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.420" end="01:31:18.159" style="s2">it was actually well it was divided up</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.300" end="01:31:22.929" style="s2">amongst the panel members essentially</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.159" end="01:31:25.510" style="s2">but that&#39;s what we decided that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.929" end="01:31:27.989" style="s2">we decided and you know faith herself</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.510" end="01:31:30.250" style="s2">had offered to bow out of the panel</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.989" end="01:31:33.880" style="s2">because she knew that her presence would</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.250" end="01:31:34.750" style="s2">be controversial in a way that might not</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.880" end="01:31:38.350" style="s2">be productive</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.750" end="01:31:41.140" style="s2">so whereas Lindsay was just a student</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.350" end="01:31:43.420" style="s2">you know and and she was doing what she</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.140" end="01:31:47.050" style="s2">was supposed to do now I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.420" end="01:31:50.880" style="s2">denigrate faith as a journalist in it</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.050" end="01:31:53.080" style="s2">some general sense but you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.880" end="01:31:57.370" style="s2">Charlottesville was very touchy and and</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.080" end="01:32:00.130" style="s2">it was and it required an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.370" end="01:32:03.400" style="s2">deft hand to go into that sort of rat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.130" end="01:32:06.429" style="s2">nest and come out unscathed and you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.400" end="01:32:07.719" style="s2">maybe we should thank kudos for her to</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.429" end="01:32:11.080" style="s2">her for having the courage to even</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.719" end="01:32:14.170" style="s2">attempt it but there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.080" end="01:32:16.210" style="s2">between it&#39;s not that easy to</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.170" end="01:32:21.699" style="s2">distinguish between brave and foolhardy</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.210" end="01:32:23.980" style="s2">and you know what they say well anyways</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.699" end="01:32:25.929" style="s2">like I said we thought about it a lot I</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.980" end="01:32:28.360" style="s2">listened to it a lot we made the</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.929" end="01:32:30.460" style="s2">decision we made I&#39;m not trying to say</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.360" end="01:32:32.560" style="s2">that you know it was right in some</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.460" end="01:32:34.630" style="s2">omniscient sense but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.560" end="01:32:37.030" style="s2">the situation that Lindsay Sheppard</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.630" end="01:32:40.080" style="s2">found herself in is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.030" end="01:32:44.580" style="s2">comparable to that of faith to make the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.080" end="01:32:47.949" style="s2">question to make the comparison</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.580" end="01:32:48.760" style="s2">fundamentally valid so Ethan beyond she</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.949" end="01:32:54.010" style="s2">says I&#39;m a Lib</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.760" end="01:32:56.380" style="s2">hi hey Ethan you know I&#39;ve considered</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.010" end="01:33:02.139" style="s2">myself a liberal for a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.380" end="01:33:04.449" style="s2">so welcome do you think I publicly</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.139" end="01:33:07.420" style="s2">disassociate yourself enough with my</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.449" end="01:33:09.280" style="s2">neo-nazi followers that you were that</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.420" end="01:33:11.800" style="s2">use your work as justification for</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.280" end="01:33:13.480" style="s2">violence and propaganda well you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.800" end="01:33:15.880" style="s2">what kind of question is that</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.480" end="01:33:18.460" style="s2">first of all you&#39;re you&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.880" end="01:33:22.389" style="s2">unwarranted assumption that I definitely</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.460" end="01:33:25.059" style="s2">have neo-nazi followers followers you</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.389" end="01:33:27.190" style="s2">know and that they use my work as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.059" end="01:33:29.110" style="s2">justification and that they&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.190" end="01:33:31.659" style="s2">in violence and propaganda it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.110" end="01:33:34.570" style="s2">about a specific example or how about</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.659" end="01:33:37.269" style="s2">ten specific examples you know I already</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.570" end="01:33:39.250" style="s2">pointed out that imagine that so thirty</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.269" end="01:33:41.800" style="s2">million people have watched my videos so</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.250" end="01:33:44.860" style="s2">let&#39;s and 500,000 of them are youtube</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.800" end="01:33:46.750" style="s2">subscribers so let&#39;s say I have 500,000</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.860" end="01:33:50.739" style="s2">followers just for the sake of argument</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.750" end="01:33:52.900" style="s2">okay like a thousand of them are going</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.739" end="01:33:55.210" style="s2">to be completely out of their minds</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.900" end="01:33:56.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s one in five hundred so</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.210" end="01:33:59.440" style="s2">what does that prove you know you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.920" end="01:34:02.380" style="s2">to demonstrate that there&#39;s a higher</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.440" end="01:34:05.409" style="s2">rate than average of Pathology among the</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.380" end="01:34:07.929" style="s2">people who claim in some manner to be my</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.409" end="01:34:13.119" style="s2">followers you know you have to do that</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.929" end="01:34:15.519" style="s2">because as I said everyone who&#39;s to the</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.119" end="01:34:17.079" style="s2">right of the radical left is a group and</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.519" end="01:34:18.760" style="s2">in that group there&#39;s going to be people</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.079" end="01:34:20.769" style="s2">on the far right that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.760" end="01:34:23.610" style="s2">everyone in the group of non radical</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.769" end="01:34:29.429" style="s2">leftists is a radical right winger</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.610" end="01:34:31.840" style="s2">obviously so anyways you know I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.429" end="01:34:33.699" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a loaded question</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.840" end="01:34:36.550" style="s2">I think it&#39;s loaded in a bunch of ways</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.699" end="01:34:40.630" style="s2">do you think you publicly dissociate</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.550" end="01:34:42.519" style="s2">yourself enough well that&#39;s a loaded</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.630" end="01:34:44.230" style="s2">question because the implication is is</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.519" end="01:34:46.210" style="s2">that I don&#39;t publicly dissociate myself</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.230" end="01:34:49.630" style="s2">enough then the next implication is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.210" end="01:34:52.719" style="s2">I have more neo-nazi followers than a</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.630" end="01:34:55.420" style="s2">random person with 500,000 followers</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.719" end="01:34:57.250" style="s2">would have and then the next like loaded</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.420" end="01:34:58.900" style="s2">bit is that they use my work as</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.250" end="01:35:00.699" style="s2">justification I&#39;d like to see that</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.900" end="01:35:02.230" style="s2">happened because I can&#39;t see it how it</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.699" end="01:35:04.180" style="s2">can possibly be used as just</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.230" end="01:35:06.130" style="s2">vacation and that they use it for as a</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.180" end="01:35:15.060" style="s2">justification for both propaganda and</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.130" end="01:35:18.520" style="s2">violence it&#39;s like really come on that</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.060" end="01:35:20.440" style="s2">you know maybe it&#39;s possible and if this</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.520" end="01:35:22.239" style="s2">is the case I apologize it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.440" end="01:35:24.430" style="s2">that you wrote that question because</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.239" end="01:35:26.080" style="s2">you&#39;re favorably disposed towards me and</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.430" end="01:35:28.060" style="s2">you know wanted to give me an</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.080" end="01:35:31.120" style="s2">opportunity to address that question and</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.060" end="01:35:33.010" style="s2">you know I can&#39;t tell but but it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.120" end="01:35:35.170" style="s2">definitely the kind of question that</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.010" end="01:35:37.300" style="s2">that the sort of journalists who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.170" end="01:35:38.739" style="s2">coming after me have been you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.300" end="01:35:40.720" style="s2">like have you stopped beating your wife</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.739" end="01:35:42.400" style="s2">yet it&#39;s like how are you gonna answer a</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.720" end="01:35:51.730" style="s2">question like that you&#39;re losing their</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.400" end="01:35:52.900" style="s2">way so okay well I think what I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.730" end="01:36:01.840" style="s2">do I&#39;m starting to run out of energy</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.900" end="01:36:03.880" style="s2">here so I&#39;m gonna read some of this okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.840" end="01:36:05.830" style="s2">all right what the hell address the</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.880" end="01:36:06.520" style="s2">Jewish Question that&#39;s a hell of a thing</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.830" end="01:36:08.650" style="s2">to ask</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.520" end="01:36:10.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s Jaqueline turn you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.650" end="01:36:12.610" style="s2">really that&#39;s a hell of a thing to ask</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.000" end="01:36:14.350" style="s2">but I will say something about it you</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.610" end="01:36:17.680" style="s2">know and I&#39;ve thought about this a lot</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.350" end="01:36:19.450" style="s2">so there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.680" end="01:36:21.940" style="s2">so those are Jews of European heritage</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.450" end="01:36:23.830" style="s2">have IQs that are about 15 points higher</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.940" end="01:36:25.690" style="s2">than the population average so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.830" end="01:36:27.250" style="s2">lot 15 points it&#39;s about the average</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.690" end="01:36:28.630" style="s2">difference between the typical high</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.250" end="01:36:31.570" style="s2">school student and the typical state</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.630" end="01:36:33.280" style="s2">college student it&#39;s a lot and one of</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.570" end="01:36:34.870" style="s2">the things that means is so imagine</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.280" end="01:36:38.250" style="s2">there&#39;s two distributions and that they</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.870" end="01:36:41.650" style="s2">overlap and that the Jewish one is is</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.250" end="01:36:43.510" style="s2">the the mean is as one fifteen so the</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.650" end="01:36:45.610" style="s2">whole distribution is shifted to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.510" end="01:36:49.330" style="s2">right what that means is if you go up</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.610" end="01:36:51.520" style="s2">into the higher IQ strata one 3145 way</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.330" end="01:36:53.560" style="s2">the hell up there that Jewish people are</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.520" end="01:36:55.780" style="s2">overwhelmingly over-represented at the</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.560" end="01:36:57.489" style="s2">high end of the IQ distribution now the</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.780" end="01:36:59.590" style="s2">price they pay for that is some</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.489" end="01:37:01.630" style="s2">increased propensity for neurological</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.590" end="01:37:03.850" style="s2">diseases that seems to be associated in</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.630" end="01:37:05.560" style="s2">some sense with that heightened IQ now</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.850" end="01:37:09.870" style="s2">you know the science on this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.560" end="01:37:12.790" style="s2">settled but but it&#39;s reasonably solid</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.870" end="01:37:16.080" style="s2">you know given the standards of such</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.790" end="01:37:17.950" style="s2">things okay so Jews are gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.080" end="01:37:20.620" style="s2">over-represented at the high end of</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.950" end="01:37:22.720" style="s2">cognitively complex disciplines so then</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.620" end="01:37:24.610" style="s2">I would say and that&#39;s the case like</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.720" end="01:37:26.620" style="s2">their way over-represented among like</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.610" end="01:37:29.230" style="s2">outstanding scientists and among Nobel</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.620" end="01:37:31.420" style="s2">Prize winners and and so forth and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.230" end="01:37:33.970" style="s2">you know people look and they think well</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.420" end="01:37:35.470" style="s2">why are there a disproportionate number</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.970" end="01:37:36.910" style="s2">of Jewish people in positions of</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.470" end="01:37:40.000" style="s2">authority and they say well it must be a</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.910" end="01:37:42.220" style="s2">conspiracy you know it must be systemic</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.000" end="01:37:44.560" style="s2">in some sense it&#39;s like no it can be</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.220" end="01:37:46.210" style="s2">simply accounted for by that relatively</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.560" end="01:37:48.760" style="s2">large IQ differential</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.210" end="01:37:51.460" style="s2">now the next criticism would be well</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.760" end="01:37:53.620" style="s2">don&#39;t the Jews tend to lean left</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.460" end="01:37:56.050" style="s2">well first you might say well you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.620" end="01:37:58.240" style="s2">given what happened in in Nazi Germany</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.050" end="01:37:59.890" style="s2">to the degree that that was right-wing</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.240" end="01:38:01.570" style="s2">as we discussed earlier that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.890" end="01:38:04.270" style="s2">nationalism and ethnocentrism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.570" end="01:38:06.100" style="s2">hardly surprising that they might you</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.270" end="01:38:08.680" style="s2">know in this historical period of time</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.100" end="01:38:11.950" style="s2">tend to move towards the left but more</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.680" end="01:38:14.410" style="s2">importantly than that IQ is associated</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.950" end="01:38:16.270" style="s2">with trade openness and trade openness</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.410" end="01:38:19.600" style="s2">is a strong predictor predictor of</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.270" end="01:38:20.980" style="s2">political liberalism so and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.600" end="01:38:24.790" style="s2">strongest predictor of political</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.980" end="01:38:26.410" style="s2">liberalism so you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.790" end="01:38:27.820" style="s2">difficult so that&#39;s what I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.410" end="01:38:30.430" style="s2">about that it&#39;s like and the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.820" end="01:38:33.250" style="s2">I would say is you know the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.430" end="01:38:35.140" style="s2">there&#39;s a population as sub population</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.250" end="01:38:38.200" style="s2">of people who are much smarter than</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.140" end="01:38:40.150" style="s2">average not on average right on average</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.200" end="01:38:42.460" style="s2">I&#39;ve you got to get that straight on</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.150" end="01:38:44.500" style="s2">average is actually of great benefit to</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.460" end="01:38:47.650" style="s2">the rest of us because what do you want</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.500" end="01:38:51.850" style="s2">fewer geniuses fewer people with IQs of</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.650" end="01:38:54.610" style="s2">145 or 160 that&#39;s and you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.850" end="01:38:56.920" style="s2">no conspiracy that puts people who are</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.610" end="01:38:58.510" style="s2">smarter higher up in competence</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.920" end="01:39:00.190" style="s2">hierarchies because IQs the best</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.510" end="01:39:03.340" style="s2">predictor of movement up in a complex</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.190" end="01:39:05.380" style="s2">called competence hierarchy so there</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.340" end="01:39:07.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve addressed the Jewish Question it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.380" end="01:39:11.230" style="s2">like it&#39;s a confusion between ethnicity</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.480" end="01:39:13.480" style="s2">and and IQ as far as I&#39;m concerned so</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.230" end="01:39:14.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll probably get like painted six</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.480" end="01:39:17.020" style="s2">different shades of black for that</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.980" end="01:39:18.610" style="s2">answer but it&#39;s I&#39;ve thought about a</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.020" end="01:39:24.610" style="s2">long time it&#39;s the best that I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.610" end="01:39:26.080" style="s2">manage so ok I&#39;m gonna read this oh one</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.610" end="01:39:28.540" style="s2">more huckleberry says should I start</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.080" end="01:39:29.530" style="s2">with past authoring if I am 40 I feel</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.540" end="01:39:31.389" style="s2">that I have so many</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.530" end="01:39:33.579" style="s2">solved issues from my past that prevents</p>

<p begin="01:39:38.320" end="01:39:41.949" style="s2">that indicates very clearly that you</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.599" end="01:39:44.159" style="s2">should do the past authoring first</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.949" end="01:39:47.199" style="s2">because you already know that you have</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.159" end="01:39:50.400" style="s2">unpleasant incidences incidents in your</p>

<p begin="01:39:57.280" end="01:40:04.659" style="s2">an illustration there I&#39;m gonna hold it</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.219" end="01:40:06.969" style="s2">up so that I can see it there&#39;s a lag so</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.659" end="01:40:17.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in focus so give me</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.969" end="01:40:17.730" style="s2">about ten seconds okay</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.630" end="01:40:27.810" style="s2">okay so this is chapter four rule four</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.950" end="01:40:33.090" style="s2">so the book has 12 rules in it the book</p>
