<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:45.890" style="s2">we know that an insight relevance</p>

<p begin="00:09:05.280" end="00:09:08.280" style="s2">thing where we&#39;re understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.360" end="00:09:10.200" style="s2">intelligence and we&#39;re seeing many</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.280" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">things just converting on converging on</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.200" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">the idea of being a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">solver and then we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing right</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">many instances already within that right</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:23.670" style="s2">once we get this notion of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:26.340" style="s2">come up with a general problem solver we</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.670" end="00:09:29.700" style="s2">see that that in turn right many</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.340" end="00:09:33.090" style="s2">different things are feeding into this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.700" end="00:09:36.390" style="s2">issue of relevance realization as what</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.090" end="00:09:38.340" style="s2">makes you capable of being a general</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.390" end="00:09:40.020" style="s2">problem solver so we have many things</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.340" end="00:09:43.140" style="s2">feeding into this and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.020" end="00:09:45.330" style="s2">analyzing so this right it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.140" end="00:09:47.130" style="s2">tremendous potential right I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.330" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">show you a plausibility structure many</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.130" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">converging lines of how we measure and</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:54.420" style="s2">to understanding intelligence as a</p>

<p begin="00:09:54.420" end="00:09:59.460" style="s2">starting to see that many of that many</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.060" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">lines of Investigation are converging on</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.460" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">what makes you generally intelligent is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">your capacity for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:10.580" style="s2">I want to continue this convergence I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:16.110" style="s2">want to make it quite powerful for you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.580" end="00:10:17.880" style="s2">right so presumably one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.110" end="00:10:19.830" style="s2">that contributes as I mentioned to your</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.880" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">capacity for being a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.830" end="00:10:26.400" style="s2">solver is your capacity for categorizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">things I already alluded to that when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.400" end="00:10:33.960" style="s2">just discussed this issue last time your</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:36.960" style="s2">ability to categorize things massively</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.960" end="00:10:40.020" style="s2">increases your ability to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.960" end="00:10:42.330" style="s2">world if I couldn&#39;t categorize things if</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.020" end="00:10:44.460" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t see these both as markers I</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.330" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">would have to treat each one as a raw</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.460" end="00:10:48.089" style="s2">individual that I&#39;m encountering for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:49.589" style="s2">first time kind of like we do when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.089" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">meet people and we treat them with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.589" end="00:10:54.210" style="s2">proper nouns so this would be Tom and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">then this would be Agni and meeting Tom</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.210" end="00:10:58.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell me anything about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:10:59.510" style="s2">Agnes is going to be like and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.440" end="00:11:03.590" style="s2">about this when we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.510" end="00:11:06.920" style="s2">categorical perception right</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.590" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">but if I can categorize them together I</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.920" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">can make predictions about how any</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:15.240" style="s2">member of this category will behave it</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:18.180" style="s2">massively speeds up my ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.240" end="00:11:25.050" style="s2">predictions to abstract important and</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.180" end="00:11:27.150" style="s2">potentially relevant information it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.050" end="00:11:28.920" style="s2">allows me to communicate I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.150" end="00:11:30.990" style="s2">communicate all of that categorical</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.920" end="00:11:36.440" style="s2">information with a with a common noun</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:38.580" style="s2">marker your ability to categorize is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.440" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">central to your ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.580" end="00:11:45.960" style="s2">intelligent so what is a category a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:48.000" style="s2">category isn&#39;t just any set of things a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.960" end="00:11:50.060" style="s2">category is a set of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.000" end="00:11:53.520" style="s2">sense belong together</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.060" end="00:11:55.730" style="s2">now we&#39;ve note we noted last time that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.520" end="00:11:58.470" style="s2">your sense of things belonging together</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.730" end="00:12:00.450" style="s2">right isn&#39;t necessarily because they</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.470" end="00:12:06.950" style="s2">share an essence that&#39;s the common</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.450" end="00:12:10.950" style="s2">mistake all right how is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.950" end="00:12:12.690" style="s2">categorize things how does this basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.950" end="00:12:15.690" style="s2">ability central to our intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.690" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">operate I&#39;m not going to try and fully</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.690" end="00:12:19.680" style="s2">explain that that&#39;s I don&#39;t know anybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">anyone that can do that right now all I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.680" end="00:12:23.550" style="s2">need to do is show you again how this</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:25.850" style="s2">issue of relevance realization is at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.550" end="00:12:25.850" style="s2">center</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.470" end="00:12:33.699" style="s2">the standard explanation the one that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.259" end="00:12:38.649" style="s2">works from common sense is the one you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.699" end="00:12:41.290" style="s2">see in Sesame Street right you know you</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.649" end="00:12:43.959" style="s2">you give that you give the child you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.290" end="00:12:46.899" style="s2">know here are three things three of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.959" end="00:12:48.550" style="s2">these things right you know here are</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.899" end="00:12:50.139" style="s2">three is these things they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.550" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">the same one of these things is not like</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.139" end="00:12:56.290" style="s2">the others three of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.620" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">kinda the same and you have to pick out</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.290" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">the one right and so these go together</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:02.589" style="s2">this one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:04.209" style="s2">these are categorized as markers that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.589" end="00:13:06.100" style="s2">the Sesame Street explanation what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.209" end="00:13:09.100" style="s2">explanation I noticed that these are</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.100" end="00:13:11.500" style="s2">similar right I noticed that this one is</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.100" end="00:13:13.689" style="s2">different I mentally group together the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.500" end="00:13:16.029" style="s2">things that are similar I keep the parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.689" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">that the things that are different</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.029" end="00:13:21.899" style="s2">mentally apart and that&#39;s how I form</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.899" style="s2">categories isn&#39;t that obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:30.430" style="s2">well again explaining how it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.089" end="00:13:33.670" style="s2">obvious to you and why how you make the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.430" end="00:13:37.480" style="s2">correct properties salient is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.670" end="00:13:40.569" style="s2">crucial thing why well this is a point</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">made famous by the philosopher Nelson</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.569" end="00:13:46.889" style="s2">Goodman great name what a great name</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:50.620" style="s2">Goodman what a great name right</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.889" end="00:13:52.600" style="s2">Nelson pointed out that we&#39;re often well</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.620" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use our language I think this</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.600" end="00:13:57.310" style="s2">is fair but we&#39;re often equivocating</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">when we invoke similarity and how</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.310" end="00:14:02.620" style="s2">obvious it is between a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:03.970" style="s2">sense and a logical sense and in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.620" end="00:14:07.000" style="s2">in that sense we&#39;re deceiving ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.970" end="00:14:09.790" style="s2">that we&#39;re offering an explanation so</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.000" end="00:14:13.740" style="s2">what do I mean well what does what does</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.790" end="00:14:13.740" style="s2">similarity mean and logical sets</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.300" end="00:14:24.370" style="s2">well remember the Sesame Street example</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:33.550" style="s2">kind of the same similarity is partial</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.370" end="00:14:36.190" style="s2">identity kinda the same okay but does</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.550" end="00:14:38.470" style="s2">partial identity mean well you share</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.190" end="00:14:40.690" style="s2">properties you share features and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.470" end="00:14:43.060" style="s2">more features you share the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.690" end="00:14:46.900" style="s2">identical you are the more similar you</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.060" end="00:14:50.080" style="s2">are there you go well that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.900" end="00:14:50.980" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty clear well Nelson once you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.080" end="00:14:52.390" style="s2">agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.980" end="00:14:57.130" style="s2">Nelson Goodman&#39;s gonna say well now you</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.390" end="00:15:01.470" style="s2">have a problem because any two objects</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.130" end="00:15:09.450" style="s2">are logically overwhelmingly similar</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.470" end="00:15:17.650" style="s2">because pick any two objects say a bison</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.450" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">right and a lawn mower all right all I</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.650" end="00:15:24.100" style="s2">have to do is list Lots that&#39;s to get an</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:25.570" style="s2">S I don&#39;t know what a by zhanna&#39;s I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.100" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">to pick properties that they share in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.570" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">common okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:36.760" style="s2">well they&#39;re both found on in North</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.910" end="00:15:39.910" style="s2">America neither one was found in North</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.760" end="00:15:43.540" style="s2">America 300 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.910" end="00:15:46.750" style="s2">both contain carbon both can kill you if</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.540" end="00:15:50.530" style="s2">not properly treated both have an odor</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.750" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">both weigh less than a ton neither one</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.530" end="00:15:55.690" style="s2">makes a particularly good weapon in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:59.050" style="s2">the number of things that I can say</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.640" end="00:16:10.630" style="s2">on and on and this is Goodman&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.540" end="00:16:14.950" style="s2">they share many many indefinitely large</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.630" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">number of properties now what you you I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.950" end="00:16:20.050" style="s2">imagine you&#39;re saying is yeah that&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.400" end="00:20:13.400" style="s2">it so one of the things a machine has to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.870" end="00:20:14.270" style="s2">do for example is avoid danger danger</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.040" end="00:20:48.910" style="s2">causes of danger what do they share how</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.130" end="00:20:52.430" style="s2">to use zero in on them</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.910" end="00:20:54.110" style="s2">you still say wow I sort of get that but</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.430" end="00:20:56.210" style="s2">still you know just moving around the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.110" end="00:20:58.940" style="s2">world finding your food okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.210" end="00:21:01.400" style="s2">do that let&#39;s try and make</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.900" end="00:21:06.560" style="s2">gonna be a cognitive agent looking for</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.030" style="s2">its food now because it&#39;s an electronic</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.560" end="00:21:09.890" style="s2">machine it&#39;s a robot we&#39;re gonna have it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.030" end="00:21:13.970" style="s2">look for batteries this is an example</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.890" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">from Daniel Dennett so here&#39;s my robot</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.970" end="00:21:19.700" style="s2">it&#39;s mobile it&#39;s got wheels right this</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.020" end="00:21:21.710" style="s2">appendage for grabbing stuff it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:23.660" style="s2">all these wonderful centers it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.710" end="00:21:27.020" style="s2">lots of computational power but needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.660" end="00:21:29.060" style="s2">you do to do okay so we know what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.020" end="00:21:32.150" style="s2">need to do in order to make it an agent</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.060" end="00:21:33.650" style="s2">a cognitive agent that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.150" end="00:21:35.180" style="s2">talking about from the very beginning it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.650" end="00:21:36.860" style="s2">has to be different from something</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.180" end="00:21:39.590" style="s2">merely something that generates behavior</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.860" end="00:21:41.330" style="s2">everything generates behavior that this</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.590" end="00:21:43.460" style="s2">behaves in a certain way this behaves in</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.330" end="00:21:46.010" style="s2">a certain way this behaves in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.460" end="00:21:47.300" style="s2">way what makes you an agent I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.010" end="00:21:49.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t all that makes you an agent this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:51.800" style="s2">is a philosophically complex problem but</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.670" end="00:21:54.380" style="s2">the crucial thing about what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.800" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">as an agent is the following you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.380" end="00:21:58.130" style="s2">determine the consequences of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:21:59.870" style="s2">behavior I&#39;m using that term very</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.130" end="00:22:02.540" style="s2">broadly you can determine the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.870" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">consequences of your behavior and change</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.540" end="00:22:07.130" style="s2">your behavior accordingly so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">ability to determine the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.130" end="00:22:12.020" style="s2">the effects of your behavior is crucial</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:14.150" style="s2">to being an agent so we build a machine</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.020" end="00:22:16.460" style="s2">that can do that it can determine the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.150" end="00:22:18.590" style="s2">consequences of its behavior now we give</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.460" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">it this problem very basic problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.590" end="00:22:26.540" style="s2">here&#39;s the right so here&#39;s a wagon right</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:33.530" style="s2">it has a nice handle and on it is a nice</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.540" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">juicy battery now the robot right will</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.530" end="00:22:41.300" style="s2">try and do what you and I do right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:43.970" style="s2">this this is also a Darwinian thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.300" end="00:22:45.560" style="s2">because for most creatures you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.970" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">not only find food you have to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.560" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">being food and so you don&#39;t just eat</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">your food where you first find it even</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.350" style="s2">powerful predators like leopards move</p>

<p begin="00:22:54.350" end="00:22:59.870" style="s2">it will get stolen they could get preyed</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.060" end="00:23:01.970" style="s2">upon etc you know each of food where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.870" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">first come across it and fast food</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.970" end="00:23:05.390" style="s2">restaurants are somewhat of an anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:06.770" style="s2">but you know like when you walk into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.390" end="00:23:08.390" style="s2">supermarket you just don&#39;t start eating</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.770" end="00:23:10.670" style="s2">you try and take your food to a more</p>

<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:21.690" style="s2">you want to share right you want to use</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.590" end="00:23:24.510" style="s2">food as a way of sharing experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.690" end="00:23:27.330" style="s2">bonding together so where the robot is</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.050" end="00:24:03.450" style="s2">handle is to bring the battery along so</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.840" end="00:24:04.920" style="s2">it pulls the wagon and it brings the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.450" end="00:24:07.350" style="s2">battery along because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.920" end="00:24:09.630" style="s2">intended effect right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.350" end="00:24:15.090" style="s2">consequence that it is determined is</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.630" end="00:24:17.370" style="s2">relevant to its goal okay but of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.090" end="00:24:21.320" style="s2">the bomb goes off and destroys the robot</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.370" end="00:24:25.170" style="s2">and we think Oh what did we do wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.320" end="00:24:28.980" style="s2">what did we do wrong there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.170" end="00:24:31.650" style="s2">missing and and then we realized ah you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.980" end="00:24:35.730" style="s2">know what we made the robot only look</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.650" end="00:24:38.220" style="s2">for the intended effects of its behavior</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.730" end="00:24:40.670" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have the robot check side</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.220" end="00:24:40.670" style="s2">effects</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.860" end="00:24:49.350" style="s2">and that&#39;s really important right every</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.340" end="00:24:52.409" style="s2">year this happens people fail to check</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.350" end="00:24:55.559" style="s2">side effects they go into a situation in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.409" end="00:24:59.549" style="s2">which they know flammable gas is diffuse</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.559" end="00:25:02.309" style="s2">but it&#39;s dark and so they strike a match</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.549" end="00:25:06.570" style="s2">because they want the intended effect of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.309" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">making light but it has the unintended</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.570" end="00:25:13.620" style="s2">effect of creating heat which sets off</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:19.230" style="s2">the gas and explodes and harms or kills</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.620" end="00:25:21.899" style="s2">them so ah we say ah we have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.230" end="00:25:24.450" style="s2">machine not only check the intended</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.899" end="00:25:27.570" style="s2">effects it has to check the side effects</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.450" end="00:25:29.519" style="s2">of its own behavior okay so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.570" end="00:25:32.130" style="s2">gonna do is we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna give</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.519" end="00:25:36.330" style="s2">it more computational power right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.130" end="00:25:38.490" style="s2">gonna write more more censors way more</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.330" end="00:25:40.409" style="s2">censors way more computational and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">also going to put a black box inside DES</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.409" end="00:25:44.250" style="s2">like they do in an airplane so that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:45.630" style="s2">can see what&#39;s going on inside the robot</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.250" end="00:25:47.220" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna put it into this</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.630" end="00:25:48.840" style="s2">situation because this is a great test</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.220" end="00:25:51.419" style="s2">situation because once we solve this</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.840" end="00:25:54.299" style="s2">simple Darwinian problem we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.419" end="00:25:58.019" style="s2">basically intelligent machine so we put</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.299" end="00:26:02.429" style="s2">it in this situation and it comes up to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.019" end="00:26:08.279" style="s2">the wagon and then and nothing happens</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.429" end="00:26:11.340" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t do anything and we go what</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.279" end="00:26:13.019" style="s2">the bomb goes off right why didn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.340" end="00:26:15.380" style="s2">just move away from the wagon or why</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.019" end="00:26:18.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t it try to lift the battery off</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.380" end="00:26:22.409" style="s2">well we take a look and we find that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.690" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">robot is doing what we programmed it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.409" end="00:26:28.110" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to determine all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:30.419" style="s2">possible side effects so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.110" end="00:26:32.789" style="s2">determining that if it pulls the handle</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.419" end="00:26:35.159" style="s2">that will make a squeaking noise if it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.789" end="00:26:37.320" style="s2">pulls the handle there front one right</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.159" end="00:26:39.299" style="s2">wheel right the front left wheel will go</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.320" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">through 30 degrees of Arc the fright</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.299" end="00:26:43.500" style="s2">without front right wheel will go</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:46.830" style="s2">through 30 degrees of our the back wheel</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.500" end="00:26:49.019" style="s2">same way back left wheel back right they</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.830" end="00:26:50.970" style="s2">that there&#39;ll be a slight wobbling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.019" end="00:26:53.309" style="s2">shifting in the wagon the grass</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.970" end="00:26:55.559" style="s2">underneath the wheels is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.309" end="00:26:57.220" style="s2">indented the position of the wagon with</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.559" end="00:27:00.039" style="s2">respect to Mars is</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.220" end="00:27:03.340" style="s2">being altered do you see what the issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.039" end="00:27:10.990" style="s2">is here the number of side effects is</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.340" end="00:27:20.650" style="s2">combinatorial explosive oh crap so what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.990" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">do we do right well we think we&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.650" end="00:27:25.000" style="s2">and this is something I&#39;m gonna argue</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:32.350" style="s2">later we can&#39;t do we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.000" end="00:27:33.490" style="s2">recipe a definition of relevance nobody</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.350" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">knows what that is I&#39;m going to in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.490" end="00:27:37.450" style="s2">argue later that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:40.510" style="s2">impossible and that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.450" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">crucial for understanding our response</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.510" end="00:27:44.950" style="s2">to the meaning crisis but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.870" style="s2">let&#39;s give the possibility we have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.950" end="00:27:50.200" style="s2">definition of relevance and that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.870" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll have the robot right</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.200" end="00:27:55.780" style="s2">determine right which side-effects are</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:59.140" style="s2">relevant or not know so that&#39;s great so</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.780" end="00:28:00.850" style="s2">we we add that new ability here we give</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.140" end="00:28:06.429" style="s2">it some extra computational power we put</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.850" end="00:28:08.770" style="s2">it in here and it goes up to the bomb</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.429" end="00:28:10.270" style="s2">and the the wagon and there the battery</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.770" end="00:28:12.429" style="s2">and the bomb goes off and it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.270" end="00:28:14.230" style="s2">just sits there calculating and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.429" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">going on and we notice we look inside</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.230" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s making two lists and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">know here&#39;s the wheel turning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:21.760" style="s2">irrelevant and it&#39;s judging you that</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:24.010" style="s2">that is irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.760" end="00:28:26.620" style="s2">oh here&#39;s the change in marker here too</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.010" end="00:28:28.690" style="s2">relevant and it&#39;s making a list and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.620" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">list is going and it&#39;s just yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.690" end="00:28:34.210" style="s2">correctly labeling each one of these is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:37.110" style="s2">irrelevant but the list keeps going and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.210" end="00:28:37.110" style="s2">going and going</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.830" end="00:28:49.179" style="s2">see this is gonna sound like a Zen Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.429" end="00:28:51.669" style="s2">you have to ignore the information not</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.179" end="00:28:54.429" style="s2">even check it the see relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.669" end="00:28:57.309" style="s2">realization isn&#39;t the application of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.429" end="00:29:00.330" style="s2">definition it is somehow intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.309" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">ignoring all the irrelevance and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.330" end="00:29:06.220" style="s2">zeroing in making the relevant stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:08.770" style="s2">salient standing out so that the actions</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.220" end="00:29:11.799" style="s2">that you should do are relevant to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.770" end="00:29:14.059" style="s2">are obvious to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.799" end="00:29:17.419" style="s2">this is the problem of the proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.059" end="00:29:20.869" style="s2">of side effects in behavior in action</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.419" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">this is called the frame problem now</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.869" end="00:29:24.230" style="s2">there&#39;s different aspects of the frame</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:26.090" style="s2">problem one was a technical aspect a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.230" end="00:29:28.700" style="s2">logical aspect in computational</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.090" end="00:29:30.499" style="s2">programming and shanahan and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.700" end="00:29:32.600" style="s2">it&#39;s correct that he and others have</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.499" end="00:29:35.210" style="s2">solved that technical problem but what</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.600" end="00:29:37.220" style="s2">Shanahan himself argues is once you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.210" end="00:29:39.710" style="s2">solve that technical version of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.220" end="00:29:42.590" style="s2">frame problem that this deeper problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.710" end="00:29:44.869" style="s2">remains and of course he calls this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.590" end="00:29:49.179" style="s2">deeper problem this deeper version of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.869" end="00:29:49.179" style="s2">the frame problem the relevance problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.050" end="00:30:00.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.850" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">he happens to think that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.540" end="00:30:13.430" style="s2">might be the way in which we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:15.290" style="s2">this problem we&#39;ll talk about that later</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.430" end="00:30:17.450" style="s2">many people are converging on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.290" end="00:30:19.550" style="s2">that consciousness and related ideas</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.450" end="00:30:22.040" style="s2">like working memory have to do with our</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.550" end="00:30:26.050" style="s2">ability to zero in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.040" end="00:30:28.610" style="s2">information but let&#39;s let&#39;s keep going</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.050" end="00:30:30.290" style="s2">because what about communication isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.610" end="00:30:32.540" style="s2">that central to being a general problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.290" end="00:30:34.040" style="s2">solver you bet especially if most of my</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.540" end="00:30:36.970" style="s2">intelligence is my ability to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.040" end="00:30:39.770" style="s2">my behavior with myself and with others</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.970" end="00:30:41.570" style="s2">communication is vital to this we see</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.770" end="00:30:43.450" style="s2">this even in creatures that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.570" end="00:30:47.120" style="s2">linguistic communication social</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.450" end="00:30:49.100" style="s2">communication makes many species behave</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.510" style="s2">in a more sophisticated fashion and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.100" end="00:30:53.060" style="s2">already mentioned to you there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.510" end="00:30:55.250" style="s2">relationship between how how intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.060" end="00:30:58.370" style="s2">an individual is and how social the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.250" end="00:31:00.680" style="s2">species is it&#39;s not an algorithm there</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.370" end="00:31:04.810" style="s2">seem to be important exceptions like</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.680" end="00:31:08.510" style="s2">octopus the octopus but in general</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.810" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">communication is crucial to being an</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:19.550" style="s2">try and use linguistic communication as</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">our example because that way we can also</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.550" end="00:31:25.160" style="s2">bring in the linguistics that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:26.510" style="s2">cognitive science and see so the point</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.160" end="00:31:29.090" style="s2">is when you&#39;re using language to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.510" end="00:31:31.610" style="s2">communicate you&#39;re involved with a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.090" end="00:31:34.520" style="s2">particular problem and this is this was</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.610" end="00:31:39.710" style="s2">made really clear by the work of Grice</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.360" end="00:39:14.060" style="s2">assume that people are trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.440" end="00:39:15.770" style="s2">the truth they&#39;re trying to give us the</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.090" end="00:39:32.540" style="s2">information there it is again</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.530" end="00:39:35.300" style="s2">oh look there&#39;s the word relevance then</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.540" end="00:39:38.750" style="s2">Sperber and Wilson come along writing a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.300" end="00:39:39.320" style="s2">very important book which I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.750" end="00:39:41.150" style="s2">about later</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.320" end="00:39:45.470" style="s2">I&#39;ve criticisms out but it&#39;s the book is</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.150" end="00:39:47.600" style="s2">entitled relevance and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.470" end="00:39:49.850" style="s2">interesting is that they&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.600" end="00:39:51.080" style="s2">this not just as a linguistic phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.850" end="00:39:53.780" style="s2">but about more general cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.080" end="00:39:56.540" style="s2">phenomena they argue that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.780" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">actually reduce to the one maximum be</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.540" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:04.610" style="s2">okay so manner this just just what is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">to be helpful to somebody well it like</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.610" end="00:40:08.450" style="s2">present the information away that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:10.010" style="s2">helpful them well what you do is you try</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.450" end="00:40:13.250" style="s2">and make salient and obvious what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.010" end="00:40:15.650" style="s2">relevant okay that&#39;s easy quantity give</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.250" end="00:40:16.310" style="s2">the relevant amount of information what</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.650" end="00:40:18.230" style="s2">about this ah</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.310" end="00:40:19.910" style="s2">and you say ah John I gotcha you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.230" end="00:40:21.350" style="s2">reduce this one because this is truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:23.000" style="s2">and you have been hitting me over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.350" end="00:40:24.590" style="s2">head since the beginning of this series</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.000" end="00:40:26.840" style="s2">that truth and relevance are not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.590" end="00:40:28.280" style="s2">same thing you&#39;re right so what did</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.840" end="00:40:29.540" style="s2">suburban Wilson do about that while they</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.280" end="00:40:31.790" style="s2">do something really interesting they say</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.540" end="00:40:33.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t actually demand that people</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.790" end="00:40:35.660" style="s2">speak the truth because if we did we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.800" end="00:40:39.110" style="s2">screwed because most of our beliefs are</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.660" end="00:40:40.730" style="s2">false what are we actually asking people</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.110" end="00:40:42.830" style="s2">to do we&#39;re actually we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.730" end="00:40:46.250" style="s2">we&#39;re asking people to be honest or</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.830" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">sincere that&#39;s not the same thing you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:52.780" style="s2">be true not what is true</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:59.970" style="s2">okay so what&#39;d you say well that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.970" end="00:41:01.860" style="s2">the maxim is actually be sincere</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.970" end="00:41:03.810" style="s2">what does sincere mean well convey</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.860" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">what&#39;s in your mind everything that&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">kid but it&#39;s oh but I convey all of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:28.530" style="s2">and all no no oh man if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:30.090" style="s2">trapped with somebody that&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.090" end="00:41:34.440" style="s2">a party it&#39;s horrible you&#39;re trapped it</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.770" end="00:41:40.470" style="s2">you say one a relative you have any kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.440" end="00:41:42.180" style="s2">and you&#39;re trapped for three hours so</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.470" end="00:41:44.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not what we mean we don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.180" end="00:41:47.430" style="s2">tell me everything that&#39;s in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.070" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">right now convey it all to me John give</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.430" end="00:41:55.110" style="s2">it to me all that&#39;s not what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.000" end="00:41:58.620" style="s2">what do we mean we mean convey what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.110" end="00:42:01.770" style="s2">relevant to the conversation or context</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.620" end="00:42:06.030" style="s2">out of all of the possible implications</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.770" end="00:42:08.760" style="s2">and implicatures zero in on those that</p>

<p begin="00:42:08.760" end="00:42:18.450" style="s2">conversation and the context so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.420" end="00:42:23.670" style="s2">also reduces to relevance so at the key</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.450" end="00:42:27.560" style="s2">of your ability to communicate is your</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.670" end="00:42:29.910" style="s2">ability to realize relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.560" end="00:42:32.670" style="s2">notice what I&#39;m doing here I&#39;m doing</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.840" end="00:43:03.700" style="s2">it&#39;s even more complicated than this put</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.700" end="00:43:10.460" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more I could teach you</p>

<p begin="00:43:16.190" end="00:43:23.330" style="s2">so this is doing relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.320" end="00:43:26.380" style="s2">selective attention and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.330" end="00:43:29.930" style="s2">decide how to hold in working memory</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.380" end="00:43:31.340" style="s2">what&#39;s going to be important to you Lin</p>
