<p begin="00:02:18.370" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">practice lectio divina is we should sit</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.090" end="00:02:25.150" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a shorter sit today</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:29.140" style="s2">just 10 minutes so we have more time for</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.150" end="00:02:32.530" style="s2">both enacting the Lexi Oh Davina and for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.140" end="00:02:35.650" style="s2">questions so please get yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.530" end="00:02:38.200" style="s2">your basic posture set your phones I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:43.349" style="s2">not disturb and we will begin when I say</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.200" end="00:02:43.349" style="s2">again again</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:50.569" style="s2">slowly come out of you practice trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.949" end="00:12:52.250" style="s2">as best you can to integrate what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.569" end="00:12:53.959" style="s2">cultivated in your practice with your</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">everyday consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.959" end="00:12:59.079" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:12:59.079" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.530" end="00:14:24.900" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.950" end="00:14:33.350" style="s2">so let&#39;s do you lectio divina again I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.900" end="00:14:35.940" style="s2">quickly review the stages so you want</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.350" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">enacted engagement we&#39;re gonna recite</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.940" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">the texts we&#39;re going to set the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:46.470" style="s2">intention maybe a reverential reverence</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.630" style="s2">what a for the revelation was going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.470" end="00:14:50.250" style="s2">be revealed within a trust to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.630" end="00:14:52.200" style="s2">transformation we&#39;re not just reading</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.250" end="00:14:56.960" style="s2">for information so we&#39;re setting our</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.200" end="00:15:00.900" style="s2">minds for reverence and transformation</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.960" end="00:15:07.190" style="s2">I&#39;m going to recite it out loud now</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.900" end="00:15:11.010" style="s2">we&#39;re going to move to the what what</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.190" end="00:15:13.080" style="s2">what perhaps us what catches our</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.010" end="00:15:15.570" style="s2">attention and there was a zero in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.080" end="00:15:18.750" style="s2">recitation repeating that when we moved</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.570" end="00:15:24.290" style="s2">to the embodied emotional associations</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.750" end="00:15:27.030" style="s2">come up the thoughts what imagery</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.290" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">metaphorical literal can we enact</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.030" end="00:15:32.760" style="s2">imaginably not in her head but is if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:37.770" style="s2">were moving through the world embody the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.760" end="00:15:42.030" style="s2">motion until perspective a way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.770" end="00:15:45.060" style="s2">and being takes shape and then we moved</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.030" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">to the existential what would it be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.060" end="00:15:51.240" style="s2">to live this way what would it be like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:54.690" style="s2">if this was my default mode of being if</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.240" end="00:15:58.020" style="s2">you fall way of seeing none that moves</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.690" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">us to the ecstatic eternal what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.020" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">disclosed about the world that I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:11.310" style="s2">not seen or forgotten then what does the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:13.410" style="s2">demand for me in order to conform to</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.310" end="00:16:17.850" style="s2">what what transformation do I need how</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.410" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">am I responsible to it how can I respond</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.850" end="00:16:23.160" style="s2">to it by transforming myself I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.660" end="00:16:26.010" style="s2">to depart slightly from the practice I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.160" end="00:16:28.920" style="s2">going to read the sacred poetry again</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.010" end="00:16:30.630" style="s2">from Steven Mitchell and you should</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.920" end="00:16:33.779" style="s2">always do poetry and prose</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.630" end="00:16:35.250" style="s2">synth Amata and how they talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.779" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">other is an important way in which they</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:38.699" style="s2">could talk to you but I thought for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.500" end="00:16:41.339" style="s2">reading I want to do something a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.699" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">bit more challenging this is my third</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.339" end="00:16:47.009" style="s2">time doing this and I wanted to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:49.079" style="s2">on something that other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.009" end="00:16:52.290" style="s2">Korean in particular it has been sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.079" end="00:16:54.060" style="s2">zeroing in on and this sucks the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.290" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">practice into and so into a broader</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.060" end="00:16:58.470" style="s2">context because I want to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:17:02.009" style="s2">sense of how it this practice because as</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.470" end="00:17:06.419" style="s2">I keep saying the touchstone for this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.009" end="00:17:10.559" style="s2">how you notice it right impacting</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.419" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">impregnating you know transforming your</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.559" end="00:17:18.390" style="s2">life so I picked up Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:21.510" style="s2">because he keeps coming up and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.390" end="00:17:25.559" style="s2">think that&#39;s happen stance I recommended</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.510" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">a particular treatise to crema God</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.559" end="00:17:30.450" style="s2">heaven sorry God humans in their</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:31.740" style="s2">well-being so I&#39;m just using this</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.450" end="00:17:33.830" style="s2">particular because it&#39;s a nice little</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.740" end="00:17:39.929" style="s2">book for caring around it&#39;s easily</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.830" end="00:17:43.169" style="s2">available so what I want to do is I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.929" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">to first of all read the poetry or</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.169" end="00:17:50.030" style="s2">through the practice with you then go</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">into the prose Spinoza&#39;s challenging</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.030" end="00:17:53.880" style="s2">he&#39;s challenging in many ways he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:55.860" style="s2">challenging because he&#39;s the one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.880" end="00:17:57.120" style="s2">most logically rigorous he&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.860" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">the greatest of the rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.120" end="00:18:02.270" style="s2">philosophers reading Spinoza&#39;s at time</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:04.710" style="s2">worth reading and mathematical proof</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.270" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">she&#39;s challenging that way is also</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.710" end="00:18:09.059" style="s2">challenging because he&#39;s right in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:11.400" style="s2">heart of the Scientific Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.059" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">he&#39;s doing something that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.400" end="00:18:17.970" style="s2">interesting and many of you I suspect I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:19.380" style="s2">hope I hope you don&#39;t take this wrong I</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.970" end="00:18:21.960" style="s2">hope you sir made me disagree a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.380" end="00:18:24.270" style="s2">bit with it because you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.960" end="00:18:27.539" style="s2">encounter in Lexi o things that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2">don&#39;t initially agree with so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.539" end="00:18:30.510" style="s2">two things you can do and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:32.159" style="s2">this is especially challenging one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.510" end="00:18:33.690" style="s2">you can just get into argumentation with</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.159" end="00:18:35.100" style="s2">with the philosopher he should do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.690" end="00:18:37.470" style="s2">but I think the correct practice for</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.100" end="00:18:41.429" style="s2">doing that is deal logos with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.470" end="00:18:43.350" style="s2">else that&#39;s not so then what we have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.429" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">do is if we&#39;re not gonna specific these</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.940" end="00:23:38.810" style="s2">when you encounter people make them look</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.790" end="00:23:41.450" style="s2">like I said make sure you&#39;ve studied</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:26.640" style="s2">here as well because what Spinoza is</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.780" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">and oppose them it looks through them</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.790" end="00:25:50.100" style="s2">and beyond them into their depth like</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.100" end="00:25:55.620" style="s2">Spinoza is talking about that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.720" end="00:35:29.950" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.680" end="00:35:34.090" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t it making I wouldn&#39;t this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.950" end="00:35:37.930" style="s2">how I would say it I think initially you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.090" end="00:35:39.490" style="s2">should read texts that more are more up</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.930" end="00:35:41.980" style="s2">more agreeably let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.490" end="00:35:44.500" style="s2">resonate with you preponderantly but</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.980" end="00:35:46.090" style="s2">throw in because and it&#39;s for your</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.500" end="00:35:47.410" style="s2">reading for example you&#39;re going through</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.500" end="00:35:58.600" style="s2">to find that balance between reaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.540" end="00:36:01.060" style="s2">you and challenging you but I also</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.600" end="00:36:02.530" style="s2">respect what you&#39;re saying mark and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.060" end="00:36:04.180" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good idea if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.530" end="00:36:08.470" style="s2">starting to encounter a lot of texts</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.180" end="00:36:11.050" style="s2">that are disagreeable to you in Alexio</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.470" end="00:36:13.470" style="s2">davina that you know you have a place</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.050" end="00:36:17.190" style="s2">where you can carry them in to do logos</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.470" end="00:36:21.520" style="s2">other people who are willing perhaps to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.190" end="00:36:24.130" style="s2">engage with you in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.520" end="00:36:26.200" style="s2">continuous with not identical tilta to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.130" end="00:36:31.330" style="s2">but continuous with what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.200" end="00:36:33.540" style="s2">with you and Alexia Davina it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.330" end="00:36:37.300" style="s2">difficult question to answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.540" end="00:36:39.400" style="s2">precisely because unlike what might be</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.300" end="00:36:40.870" style="s2">the case in a monastery so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.400" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">very practical but it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.870" end="00:36:47.410" style="s2">reason it&#39;s very plausible to for me to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:55.030" style="s2">assume that we have a very heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.410" end="00:36:58.990" style="s2">mix of people in this segment and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.030" end="00:37:02.200" style="s2">trying to teach in a way that can and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.990" end="00:37:03.100" style="s2">that it&#39;s tricky and I know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.200" end="00:37:04.900" style="s2">always get it right</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.100" end="00:37:07.810" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to teach in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.900" end="00:37:10.810" style="s2">that sweet spot that I can call two</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.810" end="00:37:14.290" style="s2">people or more novice but also challenge</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.810" end="00:37:15.960" style="s2">people who moved beyond honest I hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.290" end="00:37:17.880" style="s2">that answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.960" end="00:37:19.349" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say is I take</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.880" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">seriously what you&#39;re saying and I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.349" end="00:37:28.859" style="s2">try to adjust my teaching not to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:30.510" style="s2">Chris Hudson in my book of poetry hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.859" end="00:37:32.010" style="s2">arrived from Amazon yet is it worth</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.510" end="00:37:34.950" style="s2">trying Lexie Oh Davina with just the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.010" end="00:37:38.730" style="s2">prose yes it is continuity practice more</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.950" end="00:37:43.890" style="s2">important than cognate quantity so try</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.730" end="00:37:45.810" style="s2">it yeah try it you&#39;ll still get</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.890" end="00:37:47.369" style="s2">something out of it and then what I hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.810" end="00:37:49.530" style="s2">is when you start reading the poetry</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.369" end="00:37:52.380" style="s2">first you&#39;ll get sort of a burst of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.530" end="00:37:56.940" style="s2">freshness in the synth Amata between the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.380" end="00:37:58.589" style="s2">poetry and the prose mark the fehb open</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.940" end="00:38:02.280" style="s2">oh we&#39;ve done that sorry Reynard Ludwig</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.589" end="00:38:05.550" style="s2">oh this is the 300th question that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.280" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">been asked is what I mean what an</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.550" end="00:38:12.630" style="s2">amazing Sangha what an amazing Sangha is</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.550" style="s2">it preferable for Luxio Divina to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.630" end="00:38:16.140" style="s2">practiced on the meditation cushion I</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.550" end="00:38:17.940" style="s2">find it easier to sit at my desk for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:21.750" style="s2">reading this is where I do all my deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.940" end="00:38:25.800" style="s2">thinking and contemplation it&#39;s as long</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.750" end="00:38:28.200" style="s2">as the physical act of moving from your</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.800" end="00:38:31.859" style="s2">pillow to where you want to sit doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.200" end="00:38:34.530" style="s2">snug doesn&#39;t sort of snap you out of the</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.530" end="00:38:40.589" style="s2">the the the that state that is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.220" end="00:38:42.300" style="s2">sensitive towards insight and depth that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.589" end="00:38:44.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t snap you out of the receptive</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.250" end="00:39:00.570" style="s2">same process I was a moment ago when I</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.570" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">familiar thing snapped me into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.010" end="00:39:05.609" style="s2">different mode because that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:07.080" style="s2">real possibility but if you can honestly</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.609" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">say there&#39;s like no no I feel the</p>
