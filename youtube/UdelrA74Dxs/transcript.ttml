<p begin="00:04:11.840" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">proposal was built into the brief itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">so he&#39;s probably as he was chosen to um</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">present the the formulation of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">prospectus</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">um he you know he also used as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">to kind of sell his own approach and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">you know that um he wasn&#39;t selected</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">uh for the club of rome&#39;s study</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">as we know the limits to growth was but</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.199" style="s2">but in that prospectus he developed an</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">approach to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">social systems design which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">has been with us since and has actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">helped spawn</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">a different school of systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:57.919" style="s2">that has existed in parallel since that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.919" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">and and it has quite a bit of quite a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">bit of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">left into it uh today i think so i want</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">to uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">i want to say a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">term the problematic um</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">you may have heard that in other</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">references before and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">it is associated with both a systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:19.199" style="s2">model and a method of representation</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">so the probability is kind of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.199" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">that represents</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">uh the relationships of complex societal</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">to each other a mapping of them and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">in a generic term how we represent that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">type of complex</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">mapping and it was a and hassan osbikon</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">was a fairly understated and it was well</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:40.479" style="s2">known his own community but kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">think tanker</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.479" end="00:05:47.440" style="s2">of the 1960s he was the um</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">he was the inventor of a field that back</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.440" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">then was called normative planning</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">that led into social systems design and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.120" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">and his his mapping out of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">problematic was a way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">create a frame for sense making that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">still i think very robust</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">today a framework that</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">of what issues are critical to address</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:36.959" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">several different modes to define</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">um ozbekon was was very concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">that that in 1970 believed we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">take action</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">now on some of these not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe you could address all</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">49 of the of the plot problem clusters</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">kind of as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">but to think about them as a whole of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">connections</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">and to find critical leverages and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">actually this is before they applied the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:21.279" style="s2">system dynamics models</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">of uh foresters mit group and the limits</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.279" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">to growth so they didn&#39;t even call it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">leverage</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">then that wasn&#39;t a term used so much</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:31.519" style="s2">where i think even in the problematic</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">um or in the predicament document they</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.519" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">talked about feedback imbalances pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">much the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:41.200" style="s2">and that and so the goal of the the pro</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">the global problem boutique was to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.200" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">identify places where there would be</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">and you know in uh in in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">many aspects of resource use and food</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:04.160" style="s2">production and all these drivers</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">would impinge on other outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.160" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">that could be even less</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">survivable so that the outcomes could</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">the effects</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">of these problem systems if you will</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">would be would themselves be very</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">uh would become uh critical issues and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">an intent in the early stages of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">you know trying to identify the issues</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">in the problem fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">of what is critical what to address uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">early in first so that we could make</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">progress across the entire mapping of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">of those issues to each other and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">usually present this with you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">plenty of pictures and i show them you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">know show the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">uh oz becons um kind of you know um</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">crude view graph pictures from the 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">and some updates of mappings of the 49</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">continuous critical problems</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.880" style="s2">and because kind of the tradition in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">is to just</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.880" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">spell it out in words i want to give you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">more of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:09.839" style="s2">of the impression of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">of how you know well some details about</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.839" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">the problematic but more of impression</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">of why it&#39;s critical</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">rather than attending to the specific um</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">continuous critical problems themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:22.399" style="s2">but but i also want to tie this to some</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">other issues that i think are continuing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.399" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:30.560" style="s2">um that we hear a lot within others</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:33.360" style="s2">talks in the stoa so i mean we um</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.560" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">we&#39;re interested in in criticality and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.360" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">going to be a distinction i&#39;ll bring up</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">again this is not a matter of problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.240" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">solving that problematic even though</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">named that way so what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">do is to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:53.279" style="s2">over all these years and this is now the</p>

<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">know many years ago but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">um but they&#39;re not the causes and so in</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:17.760" style="s2">the causes themselves are so far distant</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">me go back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.360" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">kind of how the mega crisis was formed</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">and named</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">uh as a global problematic by</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">hassan ozmakan it was kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">brilliant understated scholar that not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">even know of he had he didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">many publications and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">writings that really made a huge</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">difference i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">um uh that i that you can find of his</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">are from the 1960s and before the club</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">of rome so as the scholar of a general</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2">of normative planning that is that he</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">developed</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">in in the late 1960s a view of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:01.840" style="s2">of long horizon futures</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">oriented planning that would take into</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.840" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">account um</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">strategy operations and the normative</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">and so in this in the late 60s hassan</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">had drafted</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">the concepts the early concepts of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">global problematic with 27</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">um critical continuous problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">and and those and within two years were</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">expanded of course just to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">whether or not to be dramatic but he</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.000" style="s2">added um</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">he added uh over 20 more to construct a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.000" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">final</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">set which is presented the club of rome</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">in 1969 1970</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">as the 49 and just to read a few of</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:43.440" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">in their terms i mean they included um</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.440" end="00:21:48.960" style="s2">pop uh population growth uh urban sprawl</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">widespread poverty insufficient</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">the increasing lethality of weapons um</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">uh the general i and this is some of his</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">wording anachronistic and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:01.520" style="s2">irrelevant education generalized</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">alienation of youth</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.520" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">um ideological fragmentation semantic</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">barriers to communication between</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">individuals groups and nations</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">and a lot of these sound like if they</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">could be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">would have significant impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">resolution of the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">kind of major effects in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">set</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">but he also included um</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">a a small number of very provocative</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">well the ideological fragmentation i</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">think is notable but um</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">obsolete institutional arrangements of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">course the failure of imagination</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">and the failure to understand the nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">of continuous critical problems</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">so we proposed this set as an</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">illustrated illustrative list</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">that is it was just meant to be a list</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">of problem clusters but not problems in</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">and of themselves and as</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">clusters each one of them was conceived</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">of containing</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">its own problematique so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">obsolete institutional arrangements</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">would be like a tree with many branches</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">and roots that would have its own issues</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">but that would be entangled with</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">all of the others and that he saw them</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">interacting globally</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">regionally interdependently and inter</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">sensitive that is that they they</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">touched each other in ways that could</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.480" style="s2">easily perceived by experts or others</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">that but that would have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.480" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">you know like butterfly wing complexity</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">effects on the others</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">and that they were immune to linear</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">or cause that and causal analysis</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">that is that any attempt to redress</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:47.360" style="s2">these issues through a linear problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">solving was bound to fail</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.360" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">and i think that still is the case and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">the inside of the global problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">in nineteen was that in 1970 the this</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.159" style="s2">kind of temporal urgency</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">was considered that the window of time</p>

<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">of those um major issues could be</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.200" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">recognized and ameliorated at the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">um as discreet societal concerns</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">was passing that there is a window of</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">time in which you could actually address</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">obsolete institutional arrangements or</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">with a great society around that time</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.679" style="s2">and that been programs like that but</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">these were more he was looking at more</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.679" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">the root cause some of the or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">the deeper issues that where we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">really take action</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:39.120" style="s2">and he was saying that if as that window</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">passed that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.120" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">issues were going to become entangled</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">evolved from these discrete matters of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">concern</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">into overlapping interconnected problem</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">that became eventually as we might even</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">see today</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">a non-decomposable whole problem system</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">of problems</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">uh generating itself gender continuing</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:08.960" style="s2">so we often think of autopilots this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">like a cool form of self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">and also problems self-organize and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">self-reproduce and they</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">and they interact with each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:19.919" style="s2">same way that living systems do</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">these types of of systems can be seen to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.919" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">and so we&#39;re dealing with an almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:28.080" style="s2">entirely outcome effects</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">of multi effects so you know so</p>

<p begin="00:26:05.760" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">carbon credits and trading and carbon</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.200" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re what sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.360" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">seems to me that the movements are</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">attempting to do are to push for</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">what might be a single solution silver</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">bullet such as</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">carbon dioxide reduction okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">you know i mean we want to see that as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">measure but that is not a solution</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">in and of itself and and this is where i</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">think some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.679" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">the thinking that comes from taking into</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">you know the entire problem you know and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">the entire problematic is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">of better resolving that so when these</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">when these large large-scale problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">systems overwhelm our cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">problem-solving capacities</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">we over simplify we look for some silver</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">bullets</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">uh or as my my mentor uh christakis&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">colleague john warfield like to say we</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">under conceptualize and when we work</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">together in um in in groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:36.000" style="s2">we under conceptualize even more so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">you know so it makes it hard to even uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.000" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">and develop collective you know collect</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">approaches to collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">wisdom for amelioration because we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">you know we we become um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">you know our our conceptualization our</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">modes of of problem solving become even</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">more restricted</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">in some ways so we need creative ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">of actually engaging</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll say more about that in a bit let me</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">say something about i want to tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">quick story</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">about the club of rome a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">about how that formed and how that has</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">kind of led us to today</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">so the history of the club of rome lends</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">insight into how we form</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">global action networks today so i might</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">have mentioned there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">groups that are global action networks</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">multi stakeholder multi-expert groups</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">that are addressing</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">uh the sustainable development goals in</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">different ways i probably belong to five</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">of these different groups um maybe two</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.279" style="s2">in canada</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">three internationally and so these uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.279" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">the club of rome is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">earliest</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">group formed in 1970 that dealt with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">that created you know international</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">global problem solving frame and it had</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">in its</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:53.120" style="s2">roots the uh the oecd</p>

<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">it was quite technocratic and i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">that also result resulted in the</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">big system projects</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">this is this is predicting the failure</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">of capitalism right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:25.520" style="s2">but unfortunately for the predicament of</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.920" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">and mainstream um liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">as well so it was technologists managers</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">especially economists</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">just you know pushed back hard the below</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">political blowback was such that the</p>

<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">went into submergence or submerged</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">really for</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">another 20 years or more and it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">really really return in kind of serious</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">discourse to any extent until the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">30-year review in 2002.</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">i mean environmentalists and ecological</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">economists were still discussing it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">had some growth in the 90s but not</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">really on a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">you know it started to come back as</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">actually its predictions started to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">now here i want to say hassano&#39;s bacon&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:21.839" style="s2">proposal remember i said</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">his proposal to the club of rome was</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.839" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">rejected it was hugely ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">it was insanely insightful i encourage</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">you to read the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">and but it was considered unduly complex</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">overreaching um under under</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">developed methodologically you know we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">had insights into methodology there was</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">no method yet</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">for or no technology for suitable</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">engagement of stakeholders</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">um and it and it was under</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">conceptualized in terms of how it</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">actually might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.280" style="s2">you know perform conducted as a million</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">dollar study</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.280" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">so so what happened with kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">rejection</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">of you know of the author of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">the prospectus itself this leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">dynamics of the motivated also ran</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been one of those and maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.280" style="s2">have to which is you put a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">investment into a pretty significant</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.280" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">and at some point it gets rejected and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">at that point you&#39;ve like</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">invested and learned you know half a</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">year or year&#39;s worth of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">engagement and what do you do with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">so this proposal his proposal and his</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">approaches leading up to this is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">far-reaching and promising that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">there were a small school of system</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">scientists that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">that including eric yanch who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">left the club of rome to to work on</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:46.640" style="s2">um um and my mentor uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">aleco christakis and his colleague john</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.640" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">warfield</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">who were part of that circle you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">in the nascent field of social systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">and so where the typical view of systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">thinking schools consists of</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">you know hard systems which are system</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">based on system dynamics and system</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">modeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">soft systems or you know checklines soft</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">systems methodology</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:13.359" style="s2">critical systems um critical systems</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">theory i guess you could say post modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.359" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">but as well as cybernetics and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:18.960" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just gonna flake uh we reached</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">the 40-minute mark</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">oh okay oh let me uh let me wrap with uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:25.040" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.560" style="s2">some wrapping up points because the sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.040" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">the key to this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.560" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">all of this is this is a school of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">systems theory that people don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:33.280" style="s2">know too much about</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">but this has been developed kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.280" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">us in a slow way over many years and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">then as</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">and has had it&#39;s so it&#39;s still got a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">um and so hassan went on to consulting</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">at wharton</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">and and he ended up dying he died in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.400" style="s2">2009</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">um i think the same year is actually his</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.400" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">kind of his rival</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">rasakov also passed away but what hassan</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">was missing</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">was an engagement process which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">essentially what i&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">develop ever since and with</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">with um um uh with eleko christakis&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:09.040" style="s2">which came out of this work from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">1970s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">stock has developed software for</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">engaging a debt for democratic</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:19.359" style="s2">engagement as stakeholders which was</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:20.240" style="s2">essentially it has been developed from</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.359" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.240" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">dos packages in the in the 90s to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.200" style="s2">windows packages to now</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">online and web system so just to wrap up</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.200" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">let me say i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">a long view like this helps us keep a</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">cool head</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">under the uncertainties and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">extraordinaries of the current era</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">and uh my own networks have taken me</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">into multiple projects where</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:43.520" style="s2">this viewpoint has certainly helped um i</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">think there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.520" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">you know if we look at the sdgs today</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">the sustainable development goals as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:53.920" style="s2">kind of simplistic solution oriented</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">approach it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.920" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">also can consider the complex problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:01.599" style="s2">fatigue behind that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">the the ways of problem resolution that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.599" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">we could identify</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:07.839" style="s2">leverages and relationships that could</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:08.400" style="s2">make significant progress towards some</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.839" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.400" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">and to reach all of them and so the sdgs</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">i think is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">a laudable but broad sweep approach</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">there are a number of system mapping</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">projects going on right now trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:22.079" style="s2">identify these leverages including one</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:23.920" style="s2">with a former graduate student of mine</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.079" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">that i&#39;m trying that i&#39;m working with</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.920" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">but the key issue a few key issues we</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:29.119" style="s2">need to know is how do we stop solving</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">the wrong problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.119" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">are we focused on the right problems are</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">we um</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">if these problems are so interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">how do we address the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">level of leverage where do we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">in how do we design processes for</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">addressing that can we proceed from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">normative frame like ospecon had</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">suggested</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">or demanded what ought we to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">how do we discover our values base how</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">critique the problem solving mindset um</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">how do we address the assumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">problem uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">were like le tour perhaps identifying</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">them rethinking them as matters of</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">concern and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">problems and so i would kind of leave it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">i can leave it there i guess to open it</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:14.400" style="s2">up for</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">for questions and discussion as to</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.400" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">really what ought we do because i guess</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">my answers are design of course systemic</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">design at that but</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">so let me just take a few questions from</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">there and and have some discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:29.280" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:46.880" style="s2">one if you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">um wait</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">i seem to have a few uh yeah</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:03.920" style="s2">thank you very much peter i asked a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.440" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">bunch of questions</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.920" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">i&#39;m hearing an echo of myself here i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">sorry um</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll go and mute for a sec what&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.200" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">question i asked like three or four</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">is the model that oz khan presented</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">is it&#39;s was the approach</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">and the framing too cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">complex for most people to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:35.760" style="s2">really understand what he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.760" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">uh and then it lacked that simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s one question</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">and then the other question is which i</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t ask which was</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:48.640" style="s2">is at the base of the design you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">the approach of how to go about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.640" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2">one of the things that i&#39;m discovering</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">in similar areas is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">all comes down to values at the very</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">and some people have a a model</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">that humans are just greedy selfish</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">beings and therefore incessant infinite</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">is just a given and they have to just</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">kind of trust in the market</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">to save us all and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:21.839" style="s2">that you know we should organize around</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">prince values of dignity and well-being</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.839" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">for each and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.480" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">all and integrity um</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">is kind of like disney world thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:34.800" style="s2">if that if these issues are issues that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:37.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve encountered or if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">perspective on how to address those oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.839" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">yeah thanks dan</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">yeah first of all um hassan osakan was</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">was actually 50 years ahead of his time</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:53.599" style="s2">a colleague had started to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">compose a biography of his work which</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.599" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">was hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.720" end="00:44:59.520" style="s2">we have access to his archives but he</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t publish very many papers maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.520" end="00:45:03.359" style="s2">five and some of them are like what we</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">would call blogs today</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.359" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">but if you read his um the general</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:10.280" style="s2">theory of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">of planning from 1969</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.280" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">1967 the triumph of technology</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:19.440" style="s2">and the prospectus of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:20.319" style="s2">club the predicament of of mankind</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.440" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.319" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">this is less than 40 pages they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">dense and brilliantly conceived and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">you know just so i think concisely</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">framed that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it was complex it was just</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">in a language that people weren&#39;t ready</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">grasp very well um the first generation</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:44.319" style="s2">systems thinkers did not suffer fools</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">i didn&#39;t go to wharton but i&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:49.760" style="s2">to people i i</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">make it a point to talk with people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.760" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">have studied who</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">were um lucky enough to study with osama</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">khan in the 70s and 80s</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">and he was difficult he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">extremely difficult and you&#39;d think a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">would be almost qualitative and it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">qualitative and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">quantitative and so he was very rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">and demanding and so i think some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">that was also</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">you know so was probably forrester but</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">maybe mit had more of a team approach</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.079" style="s2">and ospicon wasn&#39;t really known for</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.079" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">so much but he was he was a formidable</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">thinker</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">and and people and everyone who knew</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">them said that this was</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">well ahead of their time and so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">approach to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">limits to growth took probably was a way</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">of actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">saving what could have been a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">project if hassan had actually led it i</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">mean maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">you know eric yanch and warfield and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">christophers would have come together</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">for it i don&#39;t know what team he would</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:50.640" style="s2">have made</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">and maybe they would have formed created</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.640" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">the software then</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">but what actually happened is they</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">developed that software with patel</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">later but without hassan but they stayed</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">these these guys tended to stay in touch</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">but i found and also with warfield</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">christakis it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:07.839" style="s2">those you could never put two of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.319" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">guys in the room together</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.839" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">they&#39;re just very huge people so there</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">is that they</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">they expected you to be able to follow</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">so so they conceived very conceived big</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">um and also the complexity of what might</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">be done the technology wasn&#39;t there at</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:26.400" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">and so the limits to growth was a way of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.400" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">you know eight</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">variables run on computer simulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">you know you know using system dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">modeling at the time which is still what</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">you might do today um</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">and then uh hassan&#39;s um key insight</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">about working from the value spaces i</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">mean that&#39;s actually one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">that inspired</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">i think that those are some models that</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.960" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">um hey peter we we had dave snowden on</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:11.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">stowa over the last month and he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.200" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a curmudgeon</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">and he made an interesting comment um</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">he basically contrasted systems thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">and said system thinking he&#39;s like ah a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">bunch of schmucks</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">because what they try to do is model</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">future scenarios and work backwards</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">you thought complexity makes more sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">because what it tries to do is map the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:41.440" style="s2">the present and work towards an</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">attractor in following energy gradients</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.440" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">i&#39;m curious what you think of snowden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:47.680" style="s2">framing and how you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">complexity and systems thinking fit</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.680" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">together in contrast</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">i understand that model i think it also</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">fits with kanavan</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">model as well and i teach that and bring</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">that into the classroom so my</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">you know my students will understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">that as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">how i view the approach is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">systems as systems thinking but as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">um the relationship of of systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">as an underpinning to design</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.920" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">and so design is is a way of of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">working with complexity that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">probably certainly consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.720" style="s2">complexity theory and with with dave</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.280" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">snowden&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.720" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">and i think he probably views it as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:35.359" style="s2">type of design</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">but him he&#39;s more of a a planner</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.359" end="00:51:42.079" style="s2">and a complexity scientist in in his</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">in his work and and and i do work with</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.079" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">you know with large-scale design</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:50.160" style="s2">projects with information design</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">system and service design and so i</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.160" end="00:51:53.920" style="s2">i look you know what we&#39;ve formed in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">last decade is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.920" end="00:51:59.200" style="s2">is a relationship of of compatible</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:00.640" style="s2">systems theories that actually do take</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.200" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">into account</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.640" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">um strategic foresight and back casting</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">feedback and feed forward leverage</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">and complexity in cybernetics principles</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">where they apply so like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.280" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">good designers we look at the principles</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">um i have a paper from 2014 on</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">on systemic design principles for</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">complex social systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">and i&#39;ve identified 10 overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">principles that are shared between</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:34.319" style="s2">systems complexity and cybernetics but i</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">call them systems principles</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.319" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">and that that are shared with design</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.800" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">so those are like um ideal an</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">idealized system um boundary framing</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.119" end="00:52:52.319" style="s2">so a brief is a as a framing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">boundary critique is a systems method um</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.319" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">like um requisite variety ought to be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">design principle so i just leave it in</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">ashby&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">mode because it&#39;s still a frame still</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">chord cybernetics and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">as well um appreciating complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">generative feedback uh compositional</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">these are ways of approaching</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.960" style="s2">kind of both both fields so that they</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.960" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">they can so i think of it simply put as</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">as a compatible systems theory that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">supports effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">design for complex contexts and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">had a conference for the last nine years</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">rsd relating systems thinking and design</p>

<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">my plug in there now that if you look up</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">it will show a conference being</p>

<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">um projects so i&#39;d say even dave</p>

<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">in anarchy and ecological systems but</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">then it became</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.440" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">essential so i was kind of hovering and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">circling around</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">ecological economics but then i started</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">working on a project with uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">an ecological economist for what we now</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">in the meantime you get conversant with</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">other people so you can hold a</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">conversation i guess and</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">but also i&#39;ve been you know living with</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">some of these models since</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">um it&#39;s high school and they started</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">reading like arty lange</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">and gregory bateson just out of interest</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">because some of my</p>

<p begin="00:57:43.599" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">passed around like some secret doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">it was mind-blowing i didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">that was systems theory and you find out</p>

<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">as these ideas start to continue to blow</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">your mind that they make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:57:58.240" style="s2">they build on each other and so you get</p>

<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">the systemic design principles paper</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.680" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">i was actually very nervous about</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">putting that into the field because i</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:23.440" style="s2">hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">published strongly in the systems you</p>

<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.799" style="s2">kind of the systems domain yet i mean</p>

<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">sure it was going to be accepted and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">this the the systems thinking ontario</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">group</p>

<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">made it super strong and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if the stoic could do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">with somebody&#39;s paper but</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:49.839" style="s2">we do things like that and i think that</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.760" end="00:59:55.119" style="s2">just to sharpen</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">our insights in that same way and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.119" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">the models that we have so they</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.319" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">different skills</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">yeah hi peter um thanks for the weaving</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">together of</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">history and all these different topics</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">it&#39;s been really interesting um</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">you may know that uh i&#39;m a designer and</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">i spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:54.079" style="s2">thinking about um this problem boutique</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:55.920" style="s2">as you framed it</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.079" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">um and i so i was really interested to</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.920" end="01:01:01.760" style="s2">see this um</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">topic around uzbekon and um</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.760" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">i&#39;m really concerned that uh the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:08.319" style="s2">language that</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">and the framings the problem framings</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.319" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">that we&#39;re all using are effectively</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:16.559" style="s2">um causing the system to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">that we live in to self-perpetuate and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.559" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:22.799" style="s2">how you might suggest that we all</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">approach these kinds of issues and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.799" end="01:01:25.200" style="s2">kind of alluded to the fact that like</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">for the un</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.200" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">and the sdgs for example are kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">simplistic framing</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.400" style="s2">and i see them as speaking of um baits</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:34.799" style="s2">in them</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.400" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">as logical type errors in that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.799" end="01:01:39.359" style="s2">framed around consequences</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">and not conditions right so it they</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.359" end="01:01:43.599" style="s2">don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:46.559" style="s2">acknowledge even in their framing</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.599" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">um the interconnectedness and the cross</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.559" end="01:01:49.839" style="s2">contextuality of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">of the of the problem of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.839" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">fatigue itself and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">how how do we get away from this</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">uh sort of tendency that you you</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">spent your essentially the entire talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:06.559" style="s2">talking about um</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">this oversimplification in this like um</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.559" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">winnowing things down into these uh we</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.079" style="s2">start looking for these silver bullet</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:12.720" style="s2">solutions and so that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.079" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">like how to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.720" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">how to essentially even in the framing</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">get away from this</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">uh perpetuating the system that we live</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a very big question that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">good way to actually introduce an</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">entirely different talk which is uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:29.760" style="s2">which is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">knowing this what are we to do and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.760" end="01:02:34.559" style="s2">would also involve</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">aesthetics and ethics and dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.559" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">and virtues ontologies</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.599" end="01:02:41.920" style="s2">now and framing and so i&#39;ve suggested</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">some approaches that i like and some</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.920" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">ways of i think addressing</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">ways to um</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">ways to um uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:57.520" style="s2">work around the problem-solving mindset</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">the consequentialist approach to</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.520" end="01:03:02.799" style="s2">for example the to um account for that</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">accounts for</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.799" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">the the um uh oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:09.680" style="s2">the simplistic kind of policy oriented</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:14.079" style="s2">of the 17 uh sustainable development</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:17.280" style="s2">goals</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.079" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">there are many kind of problematic</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.280" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">um aspects to the sdgs that i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.000" style="s2">even start to address but probably the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">biggest</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.000" end="01:03:27.839" style="s2">the the biggest problem of framing is</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.839" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">sustainable development goals which</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.280" end="01:03:38.160" style="s2">you know uh shows their relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">going back to the 1986 brotland report</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.160" end="01:03:45.200" style="s2">of of um our you know our</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">our common are common earth and which</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.200" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">was good at the time</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">and framing sustainable development as</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">the approach that</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">world institutions ought to be using to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:58.160" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:59.440" style="s2">um at that time the problematic and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.160" end="01:04:00.960" style="s2">may not have been considered a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.440" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">problem-solving approach but what</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.960" end="01:04:06.400" style="s2">happened was sustainable development</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.119" end="01:04:10.359" style="s2">became conceived as more</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.400" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">what we would see in in an industrial</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.359" end="01:04:15.359" style="s2">organizational approach to managing</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.599" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">policy outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">to address you know the the effects</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:26.640" style="s2">of these problem systems which which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">and you&#39;re right it is a it is a a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.640" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">a category error and that makes it very</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">um it makes it very hard to reframe</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">because everybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">you can assume in almost any engagement</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">around the sdgs has already bought into</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">the sdgs</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:47.760" style="s2">the one way that i&#39;ve been addressing uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:49.599" style="s2">kind of a a feed forward approach to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:51.200" style="s2">sustainable development goals and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.599" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">program itself</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.200" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">is to engage in working with some of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:58.079" style="s2">some of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.680" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">kind of the new economies programs that</p>

<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">willing to go into and address</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">sdg eight which actually is about</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">economic growth relative to different</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">um geographic contexts and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a problematic sdg because it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.960" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">framed around economic growth and it</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:20.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">allow for the new new frames of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.480" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">economic systems to emerge and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.000" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve it it also just so happens that a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:31.599" style="s2">graduate of our sfi program is is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">actually the uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.599" end="01:05:37.039" style="s2">the director in the undp uh program</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:38.400" style="s2">of the he does the analysis funding and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.039" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">allocation</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.400" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">of the of the of the um</p>

<p begin="01:05:47.119" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">development and so he&#39;s using and he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">he&#39;s a real fan of oz pecan&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">he knows christakis and he&#39;s worked with</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">these methodologies</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll just say that you know in</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">the discussions i&#39;ve i&#39;ve had with</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">people like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.079" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">we are starting to push for something</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:10.240" style="s2">flourishing goals which might be at 20</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.160" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">30 and that&#39;s a long time to wait</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.240" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">but if you can feed forward you can just</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">you know this is basically breaking the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:17.760" style="s2">frame right it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:19.359" style="s2">you would do with the design brief if</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.760" end="01:06:22.000" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.359" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">um we often can&#39;t but what you can do</p>

<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">you know effectively by by by the</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.480" end="01:07:29.760" style="s2">different stakeholders and i think it</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">it helps to do very rigorous selection</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.760" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">of um of stakeholders for the requisite</p>

<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">and that usually means like large group</p>

<p begin="01:07:46.079" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">but you can do um</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.839" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">small business people and you might have</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">rural and and older and younger</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.080" end="01:08:29.279" style="s2">and people who are subject to bad</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:32.400" style="s2">decisions and people who are</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.279" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">owners of those decisions in the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.400" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">space of design and going from dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:39.679" style="s2">to design so</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:42.159" style="s2">i think it can be difficult i think we</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:45.759" style="s2">as a designer might also know we</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.159" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">we um can use a fix we we can too easily</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.759" end="01:08:49.839" style="s2">fall into</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">the fixation of the frame or leading</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.839" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">people down garden paths if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">um use design thinking too early because</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">design thinking has a way of creating</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.279" style="s2">kind of a false consensus or what john</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">warfield would</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.279" end="01:09:10.560" style="s2">would say is is is actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">facilitated facilitating facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:15.040" style="s2">the creation of consensus so that people</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:17.839" style="s2">can feel productive</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.040" end="01:09:19.199" style="s2">as they engage in a problem-solving you</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.839" end="01:09:21.359" style="s2">know processes</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.199" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">and so we need to have kind of this</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.359" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">sufficient dissension</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:26.400" style="s2">in deep listening before you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">actually engage</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.400" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">design so that&#39;s one reason i try to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:33.759" style="s2">separate some of these system methods</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:35.679" style="s2">from design methods so that you can do</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.759" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">design approaches in the system</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.679" end="01:09:40.000" style="s2">methods and you can use system thinking</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:42.640" style="s2">in the design approaches as well</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.000" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">that&#39;s probably long-winded but a way i</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.640" end="01:09:45.440" style="s2">would think about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:50.480" style="s2">so cool um we&#39;re gonna have to land the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.799" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">plane right now um because another event</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.480" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">is starting soon</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">um but uh peter any closing thoughts for</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">us before we close up today</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:01.840" style="s2">uh well thanks for asking i just</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.000" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">said i&#39;m glad i had the chance to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.840" end="01:10:07.920" style="s2">address some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.000" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">allowed me to um maybe say a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.920" end="01:10:11.840" style="s2">about what what i&#39;ve been doing you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">in the last few years to</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:16.480" style="s2">um to you know to live with the global</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">to problematique myself and to take it</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.480" end="01:10:23.280" style="s2">forward and to and to consider it as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:26.080" style="s2">a frame not only for the way to</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.280" end="01:10:27.760" style="s2">rethink the problem framing and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.080" end="01:10:29.360" style="s2">problem space that we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.760" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">but also a way to to rethink</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">and to and to and to understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">how long uh you know to understand from</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">histories how long</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:43.120" style="s2">some of these programs might take and</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">that when</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.120" end="01:10:49.040" style="s2">we may be aware of our own um</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">hubris as designers or systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">and planners</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:53.360" style="s2">in believing that we&#39;re going to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">know change the world in</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.360" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">in two to five years um that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:11:01.520" style="s2">dealing with the global problematic in</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:04.159" style="s2">50 years and if you read those 49</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.520" end="01:11:05.280" style="s2">continuous critical problems as my my</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.159" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">students do</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.280" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">i give them the chance when we train in</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:12.159" style="s2">dialogic design</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">i give them the chance to reframe</p>

<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">and usually all they do is change some</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">of the gendered language and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">not even that because it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">uh the archaic it&#39;s a little archaic but</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:26.400" style="s2">it really makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s something unfortunately that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.400" end="01:11:29.679" style="s2">creates a new</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">fixed frame almost you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.679" end="01:11:34.320" style="s2">afraid to break out of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">but it just shows you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.320" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">really still</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">you know this is going to be with us and</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:42.719" style="s2">so we have to find creative</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:44.320" style="s2">approaches to get into the leverage for</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.719" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">making progress and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.320" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">design approach</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:49.199" style="s2">approaches are about and so i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:50.640" style="s2">recommend you know looking at some of</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.199" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">the work that we&#39;re doing in systemic</p>

<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">in the relationship of these fields to</p>

<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:11:58.880" style="s2">entry points into that and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">welcome you to participate in these</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.880" end="01:12:02.239" style="s2">communities that i&#39;ve mentioned as well</p>
