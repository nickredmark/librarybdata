<p begin="00:04:57.810" end="00:05:06.120" style="s2">discussion that johannes and i had on</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:09.270" style="s2">Heidegger and the questions around</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.120" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">science technology and spirituality I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.270" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">think that would be a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">begin</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:20.789" style="s2">I&#39;ll pick up but and but guide we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:22.740" style="s2">also weave it together with perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.789" end="00:05:24.660" style="s2">know the deal logos project broadly</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.740" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">construed that I think those two should</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.660" end="00:05:31.410" style="s2">be brought into a deeper conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">with each other and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">would be a good place to pick up pick up</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">and sort of weave together what do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.479" style="s2">guys think about that as a proposal for</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:41.550" style="s2">going forward that sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.479" end="00:05:44.760" style="s2">I could I could share to just some of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.550" end="00:05:46.710" style="s2">thoughts about like kind of tensions or</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.760" end="00:05:50.520" style="s2">questions that are I&#39;ve been walking</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.710" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">around with this a couple things like</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.520" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">one is I just I I would like to get um</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">Piper&#39;s Heidegger&#39;s notion right about</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:04.020" style="s2">about the technological age and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:06.930" style="s2">history of being and he&#39;s been precisely</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.020" end="00:06:09.320" style="s2">the history of metaphysics in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.930" end="00:06:12.389" style="s2">conversation with them with them in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.320" end="00:06:15.060" style="s2">nihilism and encompassing with all</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.389" end="00:06:17.729" style="s2">believing crisis yes very much I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:19.260" style="s2">in seeing because in my mind done one</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.729" end="00:06:21.750" style="s2">level I think about it I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.260" end="00:06:22.740" style="s2">know if I actually have a different if</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.750" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference there</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:26.580" style="s2">but I&#39;ve imagined there&#39;s some key</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:29.490" style="s2">differences right but I just I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.580" end="00:06:31.949" style="s2">love to get them talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.490" end="00:06:34.410" style="s2">and just I would imagine they would</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.949" end="00:06:37.169" style="s2">deeply inform one another in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.410" end="00:06:39.569" style="s2">were would be really that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.169" end="00:06:42.449" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re honest I we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.569" end="00:06:45.240" style="s2">finish I don&#39;t think we actually caught</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.449" end="00:06:47.099" style="s2">around to the topic of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.240" end="00:06:48.419" style="s2">thesis that the history of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.099" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">is the history of nihilism I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.419" end="00:06:51.449" style="s2">we were just sort of broaching on it am</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.490" style="s2">I am I remembering that correctly I</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.449" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">think that&#39;s about where we were and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.490" end="00:06:57.960" style="s2">we&#39;re just about to get onto that and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">course the connection to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.960" end="00:07:03.479" style="s2">crisis I think is is is pertinent and</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:05.669" style="s2">relevant I start off the whole section</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.479" end="00:07:08.310" style="s2">on the the prophets of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.669" end="00:07:15.330" style="s2">crisis with Heidegger because I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.310" end="00:07:18.270" style="s2">he&#39;s pivotal figure so yeah IIIi would</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.330" end="00:07:20.250" style="s2">like to to talk about that and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.270" end="00:07:22.440" style="s2">towards sort of the broader topic that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.250" end="00:07:24.930" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to explore you know in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.440" end="00:07:26.580" style="s2">and the new series I have voices with</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.930" end="00:07:28.070" style="s2">Rob a key because I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.580" end="00:07:30.509" style="s2">you know this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.070" end="00:07:35.009" style="s2">science spirituality and the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.509" end="00:07:36.930" style="s2">crisis so that&#39;s that&#39;s one is getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.009" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">those talking to each other the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.930" end="00:07:44.090" style="s2">one is just kind of attention I notice</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">I&#39;m having in let&#39;s just come about and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.090" end="00:07:48.090" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.590" style="s2">it I was really I want one of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.090" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">Johannes I really enjoyed your</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.590" end="00:07:57.090" style="s2">conversation with your last conversation</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:08:00.599" style="s2">with your teacher about about nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.090" end="00:08:02.880" style="s2">you would inaudible yeah yes excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.599" end="00:08:07.050" style="s2">what was the name what was the name evil</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.880" end="00:08:10.110" style="s2">ditching out oh yeah yeah um yeah I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.050" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">I just really enjoy him a lot like like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.110" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">his rigor of thought but let is at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:20.250" style="s2">same time just a real unique being well</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:23.069" style="s2">but one of the things he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.250" end="00:08:27.509" style="s2">was how do we you know you got that how</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.069" end="00:08:30.690" style="s2">do we respond to the with all of being</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.509" end="00:08:33.479" style="s2">right and and what is how do you respond</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.690" end="00:08:36.460" style="s2">to that and and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.479" end="00:08:38.770" style="s2">things I&#39;m I notice I have a like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.460" end="00:08:40.870" style="s2">a wandering or attention when I listen</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.770" end="00:08:46.029" style="s2">to other people and what I think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.870" end="00:08:49.660" style="s2">it myself is on one level I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.029" end="00:08:54.310" style="s2">people so-called responding to it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.660" end="00:08:56.860" style="s2">right however it seems to me that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.310" end="00:09:00.970" style="s2">some way the way that they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.860" end="00:09:03.910" style="s2">about it demonstrates the very embodies</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.970" end="00:09:08.200" style="s2">the the in their response like furthers</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.910" end="00:09:09.520" style="s2">the issue of Technology right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.200" end="00:09:11.260" style="s2">like this notion of like turning the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.520" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">world into a problem to solve</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.260" end="00:09:16.810" style="s2">okay and just I just noticed like I I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:20.470" style="s2">think I have this sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.810" end="00:09:22.990" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s talking about with the with</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.470" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">temporality and like the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.990" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">of being is that it&#39;s it&#39;s actually we</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:31.450" style="s2">are inside of it right right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:34.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a quality of like that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.450" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">under our direct control and like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.810" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">there&#39;s something in there about and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:43.930" style="s2">given that right what is the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:46.360" style="s2">response being immortal right in being</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.930" end="00:09:47.410" style="s2">in touch with the actual phenomena so</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.360" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">that&#39;s like one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.410" end="00:09:53.170" style="s2">noticing is and and just also thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:55.570" style="s2">about it in terms of like the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.170" end="00:09:59.970" style="s2">practices right right right</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.570" end="00:10:03.190" style="s2">and and I and you&#39;re John you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.970" end="00:10:07.209" style="s2">you&#39;re my understanding of your repeated</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.190" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">insistence that not to imply an auto</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.209" end="00:10:13.570" style="s2">theology right yes like it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">process of exercising the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.570" end="00:10:18.760" style="s2">correctly and like we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:22.329" style="s2">assert we don&#39;t need to cert a being</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.760" end="00:10:24.370" style="s2">right or God or something but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.329" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">mystery and and tuchis that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.370" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">in it through the exercise of it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:33.160" style="s2">and I I think there&#39;s like deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:35.500" style="s2">parallels there but I did it irritated</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.160" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">with people a lot when they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.500" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">like this kind of mania of like it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:43.180" style="s2">to us to fix the world or something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:46.029" style="s2">that you know and I there&#39;s a tension in</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.180" end="00:10:48.010" style="s2">there for me so I mean they don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.029" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">allow me to a couple issues I want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.010" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">frame and then maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:55.949" style="s2">Yanis any issues he wants to frame so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.470" end="00:10:59.740" style="s2">connection with your second point I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.949" end="00:11:02.980" style="s2">interested in putting into a more Claire</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.740" end="00:11:05.829" style="s2">clear and clarifying discussion</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.980" end="00:11:08.769" style="s2">relationship what the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.829" end="00:11:11.410" style="s2">aspects the existential and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.769" end="00:11:14.769" style="s2">psychological aspects of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.410" end="00:11:16.569" style="s2">crisis are and because in connection</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.769" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">with that Kris and I have been working</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.569" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">on an article for the side view on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:23.949" style="s2">symptomology of the meaning crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:25.749" style="s2">trying to develop that and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.949" end="00:11:27.819" style="s2">I you probably know I think you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.749" end="00:11:29.889" style="s2">this before you distinguish between sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.819" end="00:11:32.889" style="s2">of reactive responses and reflective</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.889" end="00:11:33.819" style="s2">responses and I think for the project</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.889" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to do I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.819" end="00:11:38.470" style="s2">adequate but that pretty much sits sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:41.889" style="s2">of the intersection that it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.470" end="00:11:44.259" style="s2">Peas they&#39;ll better between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.889" end="00:11:45.459" style="s2">cognitive and the existential but it</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.259" end="00:11:48.459" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get too much into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.459" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">oncological and I&#39;d like to get that a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.459" end="00:11:51.850" style="s2">little bit clearer and that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.259" style="s2">way of going back to the first point of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.850" end="00:11:58.149" style="s2">clarifying the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.259" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">meeting crisis and nihilism and then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.149" end="00:12:03.429" style="s2">other point that came up was which was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:09.189" style="s2">appointing Honus and I were did talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.429" end="00:12:10.389" style="s2">about quite a bit which is you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.189" end="00:12:11.949" style="s2">struggling for a verb here but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.389" end="00:12:14.889" style="s2">quite adequate but something like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.949" end="00:12:17.139" style="s2">Rican SEP xual ization but in in a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.889" end="00:12:20.319" style="s2">profound way of sacredness and what does</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.139" end="00:12:22.929" style="s2">that mean for us now and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.319" end="00:12:26.379" style="s2">relationship does that have if to my</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.929" end="00:12:29.949" style="s2">first question is sacredness a category</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.379" end="00:12:31.540" style="s2">for example that cuts across the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.949" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">cognitive the existential and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.540" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">ontological is that precisely what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:38.889" style="s2">supposed to do for us and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.970" end="00:12:41.800" style="s2">trying to situate it within any one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.889" end="00:12:44.410" style="s2">those categories is a mistake but if it</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.800" end="00:12:46.990" style="s2">is a trans categorical like that then</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.410" end="00:12:48.550" style="s2">what&#39;s our appropriate way of of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.990" end="00:12:50.709" style="s2">understanding and relating to it so</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.550" end="00:12:54.189" style="s2">those are the two issues I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.709" end="00:12:55.990" style="s2">sort of try and get get clear about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.189" end="00:13:01.209" style="s2">just one other thing in there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.990" end="00:13:02.470" style="s2">just the paper that you and Chris wrote</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.209" end="00:13:09.250" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.470" end="00:13:12.310" style="s2">is so good we&#39;re gonna actually start</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.250" end="00:13:14.080" style="s2">off our our our series of videos where</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.310" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">we go through the Platonic dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.080" end="00:13:18.970" style="s2">winning paper because I think it it</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:24.280" style="s2">frames it perfectly and grounds it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.970" end="00:13:25.660" style="s2">you know in our time and related you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.280" end="00:13:27.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that you formulated the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.660" end="00:13:28.420" style="s2">problem which I just thought was I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.250" end="00:13:31.150" style="s2">just been thinking about it ever since</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.420" end="00:13:35.170" style="s2">which is the loss of the second person</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.150" end="00:13:38.620" style="s2">like person modernity as the loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.170" end="00:13:41.380" style="s2">other basically and in a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.620" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">of way yes yeah that&#39;s right and I had</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.380" end="00:13:46.330" style="s2">never thought about it quite like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:49.840" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about just that</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.330" end="00:13:54.130" style="s2">sense of where we&#39;re blind right to what</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.840" end="00:13:56.530" style="s2">one presupposes what gives a die up a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.130" end="00:14:01.630" style="s2">genuine dialogue owes right and uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.530" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">yeah I think that that goes towards both</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.630" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">my questions no surprise because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:08.950" style="s2">know I&#39;m posing the question that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:11.980" style="s2">wrote the paper with Chris so but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.950" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">the idea that that the logos might</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">actually again cut across the three</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:20.040" style="s2">categories and it might be a place in</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.060" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">which we&#39;re also finding a way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.040" end="00:14:25.780" style="s2">reenacting and therefore reimagining in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.230" end="00:14:29.200" style="s2">Corbin sense of the word imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.780" end="00:14:32.890" style="s2">imaginal reimagining the sacred and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.200" end="00:14:36.690" style="s2">I&#39;m I would like to talk about that in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.890" end="00:14:39.190" style="s2">connection to the two questions I raised</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.690" end="00:14:41.800" style="s2">yeah let me just briefly may be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.190" end="00:14:45.640" style="s2">summarized with the Genaro and I talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.800" end="00:14:50.650" style="s2">about some something else it was on</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.640" end="00:14:55.150" style="s2">Nietzsche and Heidegger on definitions</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.650" end="00:14:59.980" style="s2">of nihilism and for Nietzsche nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.150" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">is that beings are nothing beings are</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.980" end="00:15:05.830" style="s2">senseless they amount to nothing while</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:09.400" style="s2">and and that for Heidegger means that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.830" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">Nietzsche here turns all of metaphysics</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:16.470" style="s2">because he begins with beings and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.020" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">leaves to the beingness of</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.790" end="00:15:29.529" style="s2">authentic nihilism I&#39;m like and nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.379" end="00:15:31.509" style="s2">as&#39; would mean not meaninglessness in</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.529" end="00:15:34.149" style="s2">this sense that we usually how we</p>

<p begin="00:15:34.149" end="00:15:40.269" style="s2">being itself always already stays away</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.629" end="00:15:42.730" style="s2">being itself amounts to nothing and</p>

<p begin="00:15:45.850" end="00:15:51.009" style="s2">already withdrawing and then what</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.709" end="00:15:54.300" style="s2">metaphysics has perhaps you could say</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.009" end="00:15:58.379" style="s2">failed to see or fail to understand is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.300" end="00:16:02.589" style="s2">that being itself is that which</p>

<p begin="00:16:02.589" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">itself and has instead posited the</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.009" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">beingness of beings right has ratified</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.540" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">grounds and here we have as Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.299" end="00:16:31.779" style="s2">also says in connection to Sciences</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:34.389" style="s2">which try to give the perfect you know a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.779" end="00:16:38.170" style="s2">ground for all beings whereas what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.389" end="00:16:40.990" style="s2">perhaps in exercise can learn we should</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.170" end="00:16:45.129" style="s2">learn is that ground always withdraws</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.990" end="00:16:46.389" style="s2">that it&#39;s temporal is historical yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.129" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">those are just a couple of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.389" end="00:16:51.009" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a beginning so one quick one</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:52.149" style="s2">connection well maybe we can pick up we</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.009" end="00:16:55.449" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do it immediately on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.149" end="00:16:57.369" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m interested in nishitani steak on</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.449" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">that there&#39;s a religion and nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.369" end="00:17:03.610" style="s2">insert a enters into a long sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:07.149" style="s2">reflection on that and he he makes the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.610" end="00:17:09.399" style="s2">argument that Asian particularly</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.059" end="00:17:27.789" style="s2">Buddhism you see the aucd inverse</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.459" end="00:17:30.460" style="s2">actually in he and he argues that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.789" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">that kind of a bill</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.460" end="00:17:33.610" style="s2">to stand on the inversion point between</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">the two metaphysics he talks about you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.610" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">know that the pivot point and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:38.410" style="s2">where you&#39;re trying to get in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:39.940" style="s2">thinking right and so you can pivot</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">between these two and you can get to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.940" end="00:17:46.180" style="s2">this place where you do this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:48.520" style="s2">fundamental aspect shift on so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.180" end="00:17:49.540" style="s2">not changing if this is the right word I</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.520" end="00:17:50.500" style="s2">don&#39;t even know the right word I</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.540" end="00:17:52.060" style="s2">seriously don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:54.130" style="s2">right word you&#39;re not changing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.060" end="00:17:56.050" style="s2">of nihilism you&#39;re doing this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.130" end="00:17:59.590" style="s2">fundamental aspect shift on it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.050" end="00:18:01.780" style="s2">yeah I mean from seeing it as some kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.590" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">of beat privation to seeing it as some</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.780" end="00:18:06.760" style="s2">kind of deep affordance so I&#39;d like I</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:07.960" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s I&#39;d like to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.760" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">on that too because I didn&#39;t ever get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.960" end="00:18:13.420" style="s2">chance to talk about the Kyoto School in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:16.120" style="s2">this and it&#39;s really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.420" end="00:18:19.420" style="s2">I think they&#39;re they&#39;re doing some well</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.120" end="00:18:23.590" style="s2">I particularly think there&#39;s Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.420" end="00:18:25.930" style="s2">work is brilliant yeah to hide again</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.590" end="00:18:30.010" style="s2">being in time says possibility stands</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.930" end="00:18:32.650" style="s2">higher than actuality it&#39;s vaguely sky</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.010" end="00:18:35.830" style="s2">this is the total it&#39;s an inversion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.650" end="00:18:37.510" style="s2">the history of metaphysics Hey perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.830" end="00:18:39.220" style="s2">clear actuality is higher than</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.510" end="00:18:42.250" style="s2">possibility and actually subsumes</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.220" end="00:18:45.310" style="s2">consumes all the possibility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.250" end="00:18:49.300" style="s2">simply a dialectical version of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.310" end="00:18:50.860" style="s2">Aristotelian is intelligent and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.300" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">highly converts there&#39;s an hiding it you</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.860" end="00:18:54.850" style="s2">know the cute school of course</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:57.880" style="s2">originates because they did they go to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.850" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">fiber can listen to Heidegger yeah wow</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.880" end="00:19:01.630" style="s2">this is all of a sudden someone we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:03.640" style="s2">actually also understand right you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.630" end="00:19:04.930" style="s2">there&#39;s Heidi get in touch with Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.640" end="00:19:08.620" style="s2">scholars throughout his life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.930" end="00:19:10.570" style="s2">text a dialogue there up wish that he</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:14.110" style="s2">synthesized from conversed conversations</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.570" end="00:19:16.450" style="s2">he had over his lifetime with scholars</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.110" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">from Japan where he says we do live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.450" end="00:19:21.100" style="s2">different houses because we live in</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:22.780" style="s2">different languages but there can there</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.100" end="00:19:25.300" style="s2">is still a neighborhood it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.780" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">speak of a house without the houses only</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.300" end="00:19:28.930" style="s2">a house of it&#39;s a neighborhood with its</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">surroundings its landscape but another</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.930" end="00:19:32.980" style="s2">house another village somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:34.690" style="s2">and there must be no I think this is why</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.980" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">Heidi girls it gives up even on the word</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.690" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2">of philosophy but he says philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:42.070" style="s2">over it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s it comes to an end</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:43.149" style="s2">now the thinking must break free and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:45.820" style="s2">think this is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.149" end="00:19:48.309" style="s2">because European philosophy never had to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.820" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">deal what we call metaphysics didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.309" end="00:19:51.369" style="s2">have to deal with Japanese thought it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:54.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to deal with Indian thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.369" end="00:19:57.210" style="s2">much it was circling around itself and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.190" end="00:20:01.359" style="s2">blahblah absolute spirit</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.210" end="00:20:02.710" style="s2">let me be your prophet but if now it has</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.359" end="00:20:05.309" style="s2">to deal with it and hiding it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.710" end="00:20:08.289" style="s2">free from this and that that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.309" end="00:20:11.279" style="s2">where were we I think where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.289" end="00:20:14.889" style="s2">go is to have this dialogue between</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.279" end="00:20:16.469" style="s2">these different houses of meaning if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.889" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">like these different planes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.469" end="00:20:22.269" style="s2">because exactly as you say it so they</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.969" style="s2">don&#39;t think consider what we call</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.269" end="00:20:27.339" style="s2">nihilism from a moral perspective I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.969" end="00:20:29.559" style="s2">we do bicho though this is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.339" end="00:20:31.690" style="s2">that don&#39;t go there don&#39;t go to once a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.559" end="00:20:34.629" style="s2">nothing but for someone like hide again</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.690" end="00:20:36.820" style="s2">and for the Cure to school you begin</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.629" end="00:20:40.179" style="s2">with there is nothing you have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.820" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">this withdrawal this denial concealment</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.179" end="00:20:46.029" style="s2">however you refer to it and only then</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.580" end="00:20:48.639" style="s2">all of us weirdly enough beings light up</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.029" end="00:20:51.429" style="s2">again in their wealth because they no</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.639" end="00:20:54.489" style="s2">longer attacked as standing reserve for</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.429" end="00:20:57.339" style="s2">example notion that&#39;s a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.489" end="00:20:58.809" style="s2">of beings as in terms of a beingness of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.339" end="00:21:00.879" style="s2">beings is something waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.809" end="00:21:04.089" style="s2">explode connected it&#39;s to connect it to</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.879" end="00:21:06.509" style="s2">thinking of beings only insofar as they</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.089" end="00:21:08.889" style="s2">act and picking up on this on the key of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.509" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">actuality is you know how things act</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.889" end="00:21:14.619" style="s2">right which is different right right</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:17.320" style="s2">right from from how they are and in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.619" end="00:21:19.599" style="s2">sense of both you know the phenomena are</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.320" end="00:21:21.999" style="s2">they shine into infinity as you said</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.599" end="00:21:25.779" style="s2">they&#39;re also withdrawing at the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.999" end="00:21:27.249" style="s2">time yeah this is what I think even</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.779" end="00:21:29.820" style="s2">Aristotle shied away from this because</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.249" end="00:21:32.019" style="s2">Dunamis which is the word Dunamis is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.820" end="00:21:34.419" style="s2">potentiality in Greek we get the word</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.789" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">lingering there but that&#39;s something the</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:57.280" style="s2">philosophy metaphysics cetera has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.889" end="00:21:58.750" style="s2">scared off right away from a</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.220" end="00:22:03.880" style="s2">which I have a deep criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.450" end="00:22:06.370" style="s2">neoplatonism and the nishitani makes it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.880" end="00:22:08.830" style="s2">of course nothingness because you see</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.370" end="00:22:12.030" style="s2">for example in platanus that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.830" end="00:22:15.190" style="s2">potentiality becomes equated with evil</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.030" end="00:22:18.490" style="s2">explicitly now that that had sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.190" end="00:22:20.050" style="s2">that had an important call cultural even</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.490" end="00:22:22.420" style="s2">ontological function because it gave up</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.050" end="00:22:24.760" style="s2">it gave a locus for evil and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.420" end="00:22:27.400" style="s2">rendered it in some sense metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.760" end="00:22:29.530" style="s2">intelligible right even saying that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.400" end="00:22:31.000" style="s2">a place of non intelligibility only</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.530" end="00:22:33.430" style="s2">makes sense if you can situate it within</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.000" end="00:22:35.110" style="s2">a field of intelligibility right and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.430" end="00:22:37.900" style="s2">I get why I get why that was an</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.110" end="00:22:39.720" style="s2">attractive idea right I see why that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.900" end="00:22:43.900" style="s2">very attractive idea why people work</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.720" end="00:22:46.330" style="s2">adhere to it but I think I think what</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.900" end="00:22:48.520" style="s2">I&#39;m saying is I think it&#39;s converging</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.330" end="00:22:52.420" style="s2">with your point is it permanently</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.520" end="00:22:54.850" style="s2">besmirched you know potentiality with</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.420" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">you know the taint of the chaotic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.850" end="00:23:00.010" style="s2">the evil and the demonic and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:01.930" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard like when I&#39;m even trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.010" end="00:23:05.050" style="s2">to teach dynamical systems and which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.930" end="00:23:06.610" style="s2">directly related to dynamic again but</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:09.670" style="s2">when I try to say look you have to shift</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.610" end="00:23:11.260" style="s2">and I you know I&#39;ll put a piece of chalk</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.670" end="00:23:13.480" style="s2">on a table and I&#39;ll push it and I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.260" end="00:23:14.740" style="s2">well why did it move you know say well</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.480" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">because you pushed it I said well but</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.740" end="00:23:18.580" style="s2">why else did it move right and then look</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.110" end="00:23:20.650" style="s2">at me and they look at me well you</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.580" end="00:23:22.690" style="s2">wanted to move no no no no no not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.650" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">why did it move and there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.690" end="00:23:27.040" style="s2">silence for a while and in silence and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:29.680" style="s2">then when somebody will say well because</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.040" end="00:23:32.710" style="s2">there was like open space in front of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.680" end="00:23:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s a aha so but why are you so fixated</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.710" end="00:23:38.020" style="s2">on the event why can&#39;t you see the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.620" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">constraints that make things possible as</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.020" end="00:23:43.570" style="s2">opposed to the events that are making</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:45.550" style="s2">things act right right so we like we</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.570" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">like even just trying to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.550" end="00:23:49.510" style="s2">something you know this is up your</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.770" end="00:23:51.460" style="s2">philosophy this is just trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.510" end="00:23:53.560" style="s2">them to understand dynamical systems I</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.460" end="00:23:55.870" style="s2">have to first I have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.560" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">metaphysical move at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.870" end="00:24:02.200" style="s2">the class of getting them to break away</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">from regarding actuality as a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.200" end="00:24:06.610" style="s2">for reality and just getting them to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.360" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">break that in their mind then it takes</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:08.680" style="s2">them some time to do it but once they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.680" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">I can i I can I can see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:15.610" style="s2">Oh Oh and then you see all these and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">then they realize all the possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.610" end="00:24:20.650" style="s2">for addressing a lot of you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">really tricky thorny problems I now have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.650" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">a space in which you can address them</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:26.230" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t address them before</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:29.470" style="s2">but it I&#39;m only pointing out for this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.230" end="00:24:30.789" style="s2">because it&#39;s just so how pervasive this</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.470" end="00:24:33.190" style="s2">way of thinking is and that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.789" end="00:24:34.419" style="s2">like when I read religion religion and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.190" end="00:24:36.820" style="s2">nothing this for the first time it just</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.419" end="00:24:40.179" style="s2">looked like it really blew my mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.820" end="00:24:42.970" style="s2">because I thought heidegger&#39;s idea about</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.179" end="00:24:45.549" style="s2">that Ichi just inverts but I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.970" end="00:24:47.470" style="s2">I needed something like nishitani to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.549" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">but what&#39;s different from the like just</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.470" end="00:24:51.130" style="s2">the inversion what what&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:54.220" style="s2">trans framing for you is one of my terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.130" end="00:24:56.049" style="s2">of this looked like initiative me a sort</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.220" end="00:24:58.299" style="s2">of a really so my first deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.049" end="00:25:05.049" style="s2">understanding of what that might look</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.299" end="00:25:07.390" style="s2">like in that that sense of you know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.049" end="00:25:11.610" style="s2">that that exercise that you just said so</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:13.960" style="s2">much demonstrates I think is is the is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.610" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">the thing that Heidegger is getting at</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.960" end="00:25:20.770" style="s2">which is about this whole techno</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:25.179" style="s2">in-frame movement where it&#39;s it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.770" end="00:25:27.280" style="s2">like it&#39;s like it at this time it figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.179" end="00:25:30.970" style="s2">eise&#39;s everything right so like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.280" end="00:25:33.730" style="s2">moment the moment the ground right or a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.970" end="00:25:35.940" style="s2">background it it just keeps figure a guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.730" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">like it&#39;s only valid if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.940" end="00:25:41.260" style="s2">positionable right locatable and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:44.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s just really</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.260" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">I think I keep finding myself impressed</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.260" end="00:25:50.289" style="s2">with that that that sense of know that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:53.289" style="s2">there&#39;s an intelligibility right there</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.289" end="00:25:56.530" style="s2">is an understanding that that I&#39;m inside</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.289" end="00:25:58.299" style="s2">of right that organizes everything mmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.530" end="00:26:00.340" style="s2">which that I don&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.299" end="00:26:03.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not even personal it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.340" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s constituting and how things</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.640" end="00:26:09.190" style="s2">make sense right until that motion word</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.820" end="00:26:11.169" style="s2">that just just that there&#39;s that issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.190" end="00:26:15.130" style="s2">where it&#39;s like well why do you always</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.169" end="00:26:17.169" style="s2">just figure the events and you just have</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.130" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">to be up to date sit sit with them to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.169" end="00:26:21.850" style="s2">able to see that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:24.659" style="s2">ground that allows for this that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.850" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">withdrawals that you can&#39;t figure they</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.659" end="00:26:31.889" style="s2">what that is very much can we can we</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:35.519" style="s2">pick up on that because that goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.889" end="00:26:36.929" style="s2">towards my was it my first question like</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.519" end="00:26:38.639" style="s2">that understanding you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.929" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">guy this is what this one I want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.639" end="00:26:42.210" style="s2">of slow down on and try and zoom in on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:47.099" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:50.210" style="s2">out about you know something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.099" end="00:26:52.499" style="s2">trans categorical that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.210" end="00:26:55.379" style="s2">encompasses it&#39;s not it&#39;s not orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.499" end="00:26:56.849" style="s2">to but it&#39;s not reducible to any one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.379" end="00:27:00.149" style="s2">these categories so I&#39;m reducible to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.849" end="00:27:01.979" style="s2">cognitive or the existential more or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.149" end="00:27:04.619" style="s2">ontological and I suggested to you that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.979" end="00:27:07.320" style="s2">maybe sacredness is like that and and I</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.619" end="00:27:09.149" style="s2">think you&#39;re try it sounds to me lets me</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.320" end="00:27:11.190" style="s2">speak very clearly carefully it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.149" end="00:27:13.349" style="s2">to me like you&#39;re trying to point to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.190" end="00:27:15.299" style="s2">kind of understanding a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.349" end="00:27:18.090" style="s2">comportment to that kind of trans</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.299" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">categorical sacredness and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.090" end="00:27:22.499" style="s2">we could touch on unpack that together I</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:26.340" style="s2">think that would be very helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.499" end="00:27:29.369" style="s2">I think that goes towards this issue</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.340" end="00:27:32.070" style="s2">about you know what the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.369" end="00:27:33.450" style="s2">is and how it I agreed if we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.070" end="00:27:34.049" style="s2">identify the meaning crisis with</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.450" end="00:27:36.570" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.049" end="00:27:38.460" style="s2">I think nihilism is a perennial aspect</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.570" end="00:27:42.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain sense in which it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.460" end="00:27:44.249" style="s2">now you know maybe to use your term guys</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.809" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">worked before grounded or more figured</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.249" end="00:27:49.080" style="s2">for people and I would but I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.279" style="s2">even want to equate that exactly with</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.080" end="00:27:53.159" style="s2">the meeting crisis I would say something</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.279" end="00:27:54.479" style="s2">like nihilism is an aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.159" end="00:27:55.830" style="s2">meaning crisis because when I when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.479" end="00:28:00.379" style="s2">pointing for the meaning crisis I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.970" end="00:28:38.310" style="s2">how we how we try to find &#39;mentally make</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.799" end="00:28:42.420" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.310" end="00:28:45.570" style="s2">and a adopt agency in the world so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.420" end="00:28:47.730" style="s2">I think it&#39;s for me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a larger</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.570" end="00:28:50.280" style="s2">category than just what is encompassed</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.730" end="00:28:53.010" style="s2">by nihilism in both the popular sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.280" end="00:28:54.150" style="s2">and and also I think the more profound</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.010" end="00:28:55.320" style="s2">sense that we&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.150" end="00:28:58.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.320" end="00:29:02.120" style="s2">kyoto school so so the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.920" end="00:29:05.730" style="s2">then is something distinctly modern</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.120" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">something of this epoch I think so</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.730" end="00:29:11.310" style="s2">although I would want to say that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:13.500" style="s2">was something deeply analogous to it in</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.310" end="00:29:16.290" style="s2">the Hellenistic period that you have you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.500" end="00:29:19.620" style="s2">had something like that in which there</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.290" end="00:29:21.990" style="s2">was you know pervasive sense this</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.620" end="00:29:25.110" style="s2">connection of a loss of touch with</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.990" end="00:29:27.570" style="s2">realness and there was and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.110" end="00:29:29.940" style="s2">the whole metaphor of the philosopher as</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.570" end="00:29:32.250" style="s2">the physician of the psyche comes into</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.940" end="00:29:33.840" style="s2">prominence right and it&#39;s actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.250" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">actually the progenitor of most of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.840" end="00:29:37.650" style="s2">cognitive therapies today comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:40.710" style="s2">that particular meaning crisis and what</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.650" end="00:29:43.860" style="s2">what was interesting was the culture was</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.710" end="00:29:46.020" style="s2">able to sort of reconfigure philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.860" end="00:29:48.990" style="s2">and what it meant and and then that had</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.020" end="00:29:51.090" style="s2">impacts on religion that sort of seemed</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.990" end="00:29:52.560" style="s2">to have alleviated a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.090" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">suffering and the distress</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.560" end="00:29:56.940" style="s2">whereas we seem to be in a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:59.280" style="s2">worse off if I can put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.940" end="00:30:01.670" style="s2">because of our disconnection from our</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.280" end="00:30:04.740" style="s2">wisdom traditions we don&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.670" end="00:30:06.420" style="s2">access to the resources we need in order</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.740" end="00:30:07.950" style="s2">to bring about the transformations that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.420" end="00:30:10.350" style="s2">are the analogous to what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.950" end="00:30:13.230" style="s2">the Hellenistic period so in one sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.350" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">yes but yeah I&#39;m gonna say that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.230" end="00:30:18.300" style="s2">how I&#39;d answer that question yeah did</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:20.510" style="s2">this just maybe a brought a point but</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.300" end="00:30:22.530" style="s2">this maybe makes it more accessible what</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.510" end="00:30:24.390" style="s2">what about it is that Heidegger means</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.530" end="00:30:27.030" style="s2">when he speaks of the science forgets in</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.390" end="00:30:30.300" style="s2">hide the Oblivion of forgetting of being</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.030" end="00:30:32.400" style="s2">yeah being cut off from what you would</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.300" end="00:30:34.500" style="s2">say these resources of wisdom yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.400" end="00:30:37.500" style="s2">without being totally divided from and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.500" end="00:30:39.180" style="s2">so we try to make sense by accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.500" end="00:30:41.520" style="s2">right over seeing ourselves as workers</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.180" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">or giving ourselves meaning but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.520" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">trouble kicking god says if you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">give meaning to ourselves or to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:50.429" style="s2">something we can throw away that meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:51.230" style="s2">the next day yes something deep oh it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.429" end="00:30:53.390" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.230" end="00:30:56.150" style="s2">posited by us which is the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.390" end="00:30:58.630" style="s2">subjectivity that tries to get that get</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.150" end="00:31:01.220" style="s2">that done but that totally doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.630" end="00:31:03.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a paranoia that maybe kicks into</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.220" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">with with late modern subjectivity now</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.130" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">and and yeah and this sense of being and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:12.770" style="s2">count off I think is what perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:14.570" style="s2">what depression indicates worse all</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.770" end="00:31:16.040" style="s2">right some well I was gonna say I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.570" end="00:31:17.480" style="s2">gonna say I mean here&#39;s the clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.040" end="00:31:19.429" style="s2">instance of where you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.480" end="00:31:21.110" style="s2">existential mode the wait okay so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.429" end="00:31:23.299" style="s2">there&#39;s an ontological thing there&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.110" end="00:31:25.520" style="s2">relationship to being and then we get</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.299" end="00:31:28.010" style="s2">our existential mode right obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.520" end="00:31:30.400" style="s2">picked up on by like regard but then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.010" end="00:31:34.280" style="s2">see it connecting to psychological</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.400" end="00:31:36.200" style="s2">factors because I mean the the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.280" end="00:31:38.090" style="s2">science on meaning says that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:40.040" style="s2">biggest fun so we tend to emphasize our</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.090" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">culture likes to say that in fact we use</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.040" end="00:31:44.419" style="s2">this as a synonym and it also shows</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.750" end="00:31:46.220" style="s2">again this collapse into actuality that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.419" end="00:31:49.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about right that what</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">that top my my might my life is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.220" end="00:31:53.299" style="s2">meaningful if I have a purpose and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:55.490" style="s2">this right it&#39;s the purpose all right</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.299" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">now having a sense of purpose in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.490" end="00:32:00.380" style="s2">does psychologically contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">meaning life but not as much as a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.380" end="00:32:04.010" style="s2">of mattering which is a sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:07.210" style="s2">connected to something that is larger</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.010" end="00:32:10.120" style="s2">than yourself that has a value</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.210" end="00:32:13.820" style="s2">independent of your egocentric desires</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.120" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">all right and so that it so basically</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.820" end="00:32:17.419" style="s2">what it does it to put it into a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:18.919" style="s2">and this then takes it back into</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.419" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">kirkegaard you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see why in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.919" end="00:32:23.620" style="s2">sec it challenged you to it challenges</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">you to aspire to transformation right</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.620" end="00:32:27.290" style="s2">because they&#39;re the only way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:29.210" style="s2">appropriately relating the only way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.290" end="00:32:31.250" style="s2">connecting to something that you accept</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.210" end="00:32:34.190" style="s2">is larger than yourself is through some</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.250" end="00:32:35.240" style="s2">kind of transformation some kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.190" end="00:32:38.270" style="s2">transcendence right</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.240" end="00:32:40.580" style="s2">and so that mattering to people is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.270" end="00:32:42.350" style="s2">actually psychologically crucial but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.580" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">takes you into this existential project</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.350" end="00:32:46.100" style="s2">of aspirate of the aspiration of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.470" style="s2">transcendence and then that puts you</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.100" end="00:32:51.260" style="s2">back into the ontological problem of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.470" end="00:32:56.179" style="s2">what the heck does self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.260" end="00:32:57.650" style="s2">mean in our ontology so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.179" end="00:32:59.450" style="s2">mean about how I see all three connected</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.650" end="00:33:01.280" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a good sort of case study</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.450" end="00:33:03.640" style="s2">of exactly what I&#39;m trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.280" end="00:33:03.640" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.770" end="00:33:13.510" style="s2">it&#39;s yes well I just don&#39;t know just I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.690" end="00:33:17.950" style="s2">love what your what your put I love what</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.510" end="00:33:20.309" style="s2">your possessed by John I&#39;m sorry did I</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.950" end="00:33:25.809" style="s2">just I didn&#39;t mean to do I get</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.309" end="00:33:27.220" style="s2">overwhelming I just like it I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.809" end="00:33:28.990" style="s2">actually feeling like I&#39;m just a voice</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.220" end="00:33:31.380" style="s2">for the the pregnancy of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.990" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">connections speaking themselves write</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.380" end="00:33:36.820" style="s2">that like the way that the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:39.490" style="s2">the existential and the ontological are</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.820" end="00:33:41.350" style="s2">all they&#39;re not identical claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.490" end="00:33:43.090" style="s2">I&#39;m not doing a reduction here but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.350" end="00:33:45.340" style="s2">see how they&#39;re interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.090" end="00:33:47.650" style="s2">therefore the problem if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.340" end="00:33:49.419" style="s2">right word of look for what would the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.650" end="00:33:51.580" style="s2">issue that we&#39;re trying to address is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.419" end="00:33:54.460" style="s2">not one that can simply be addressed by</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.580" end="00:33:57.970" style="s2">therapy or even by philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.460" end="00:34:01.000" style="s2">academic sense yeah no no no it must be</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.970" end="00:34:02.950" style="s2">back in the palace it must be back in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.000" end="00:34:06.820" style="s2">where where philosophy always were</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.950" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">strongest yes yes back in the call it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.820" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">public sphere whatever but it meets and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:15.820" style="s2">it needs to be right when you speak off</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:17.619" style="s2">but this sense that I matter but I met</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.820" end="00:34:20.679" style="s2">her because there&#39;s something else that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.619" end="00:34:24.220" style="s2">matters more than than just I yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.679" end="00:34:28.119" style="s2">true sense of all a sense of dangerous</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.220" end="00:34:48.700" style="s2">this is to say there is something</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.600" end="00:34:50.770" style="s2">uncanny even just about existence the</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.880" end="00:35:05.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s very important to me is is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.590" end="00:35:06.460" style="s2">memory is shared if you like in English</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.350" end="00:35:08.859" style="s2">I think as you could say something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.460" end="00:35:12.190" style="s2">a shared sense of memory that&#39;s larger</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.859" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">than just my memory I&#39;m gonna gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.190" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">leaping around a bit now so apologies</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:16.270" style="s2">for that but when you think of how</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">transhumanism for exam</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.270" end="00:35:20.619" style="s2">tries to sell us immortality which would</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:22.650" style="s2">mean that all our memories get shared in</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.619" end="00:35:25.570" style="s2">the cloud that that&#39;s a copy of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.650" end="00:35:27.430" style="s2">that&#39;s probably not how I would think</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.570" end="00:35:30.670" style="s2">how memory works I think that memory is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.430" end="00:35:33.970" style="s2">much larger it&#39;s shared as a extend</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.670" end="00:35:37.900" style="s2">itself that you were thrown into and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.970" end="00:35:40.110" style="s2">share in that a sense of memory that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.900" end="00:35:44.140" style="s2">are being cut off from because we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.110" end="00:35:47.470" style="s2">basically encapsulated isolated pinned</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.140" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">down just on us just me and it&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:53.020" style="s2">subjectivity that matters I I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:55.630" style="s2">ground of my world transformations just</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.020" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">about optimizing myself in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.630" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">better in order to achieve this and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:02.710" style="s2">but it&#39;s never or not often at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:06.430" style="s2">getting back to a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.710" end="00:36:09.010" style="s2">understanding again what what are the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.430" end="00:36:12.940" style="s2">fundamental questions of for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.010" end="00:36:15.700" style="s2">existence and if we do so and that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.940" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">would have to accept however finitude</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.700" end="00:36:20.859" style="s2">and death and and also certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:22.630" style="s2">powerlessness not an entire</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.859" end="00:36:26.590" style="s2">powerlessness but to a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.630" end="00:36:30.310" style="s2">powerlessness in the face of existence</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.590" end="00:36:32.859" style="s2">itself so that&#39;s interesting so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.310" end="00:36:37.990" style="s2">two things I want to bring up about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.859" end="00:36:39.780" style="s2">then so a question is a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.990" end="00:36:42.460" style="s2">between Heidegger sense of the uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.780" end="00:36:43.869" style="s2">and Otto sense of the numinous which</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.460" end="00:36:46.210" style="s2">Chris and I talk about them quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.869" end="00:36:51.210" style="s2">they&#39;re both post content so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.210" end="00:36:54.520" style="s2">completely irrelevant yeah and and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.210" end="00:36:56.920" style="s2">the what but that has to do with again</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.520" end="00:36:58.210" style="s2">with this this this thing I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.920" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">about the sacredness because presumably</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.210" end="00:37:03.490" style="s2">the sacred wood would do exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:05.710" style="s2">said it would give you the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.490" end="00:37:08.230" style="s2">muttering that puts you into the correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.710" end="00:37:11.080" style="s2">existential mode of aspiration right</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.230" end="00:37:13.210" style="s2">that then also gave you a sense of an</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.080" end="00:37:16.780" style="s2">affordance of self transcendence that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.210" end="00:37:18.580" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just subjective projection that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.780" end="00:37:22.540" style="s2">was in some set had some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.580" end="00:37:24.190" style="s2">connectedness to reality to it and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.540" end="00:37:27.460" style="s2">that&#39;s again helps me to sharpen that a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.190" end="00:37:30.099" style="s2">little bit and so what role does the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.460" end="00:37:31.900" style="s2">like is the uncanny light</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.099" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">numinous or are they just different ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.900" end="00:37:37.390" style="s2">of the same thing and then what did and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.900" end="00:37:40.150" style="s2">again what that has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.390" end="00:37:42.579" style="s2">collective memory because one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.150" end="00:37:44.140" style="s2">see religions doing and this has come</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.579" end="00:37:46.479" style="s2">out in my discussions with Paul van der</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.140" end="00:37:49.539" style="s2">clay is they represent a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.479" end="00:37:51.849" style="s2">cognitive memory of encounters with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.539" end="00:37:53.410" style="s2">sacred right and and that it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.849" end="00:37:55.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong to any one person</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.410" end="00:37:57.819" style="s2">precisely that was the holy idea of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.479" end="00:38:01.739" style="s2">ecclesia the body of Christ right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.819" end="00:38:05.049" style="s2">it&#39;s a car it&#39;s a distributed thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.739" end="00:38:06.910" style="s2">across time and John Kahrs really talks</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.049" end="00:38:08.529" style="s2">about this a lot in his book the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.910" end="00:38:12.039" style="s2">religious case against belief where he</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.529" end="00:38:14.680" style="s2">said we&#39;ve lost that sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.039" end="00:38:17.109" style="s2">what what you actually have you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.680" end="00:38:19.660" style="s2">like this this I don&#39;t know what to call</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.109" end="00:38:21.999" style="s2">it it&#39;s this sort of structure that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.660" end="00:38:23.499" style="s2">keeps forming around mystery and it sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.999" end="00:38:25.420" style="s2">of carries it forward and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.499" end="00:38:27.339" style="s2">it&#39;s remembered and then we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.420" end="00:38:31.509" style="s2">that as we&#39;re trying to solidify and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.339" end="00:38:33.519" style="s2">still it in two sets of beliefs but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.509" end="00:38:35.769" style="s2">point I&#39;m trying to make is that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.519" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">church is that I&#39;m using the church as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.769" end="00:38:41.769" style="s2">categorical things I don&#39;t mean like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">Roman Catholic Church right it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.769" end="00:38:45.819" style="s2">me that one of the places in which you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:48.729" style="s2">get a clear instance of where cultures</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.819" end="00:38:51.729" style="s2">have tried to maintain that distributed</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.729" end="00:38:53.859" style="s2">collective memory of the encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.729" end="00:38:56.319" style="s2">the uncanny or what I might call the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.859" end="00:38:58.690" style="s2">sacred Rite and and to try and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.319" end="00:39:00.940" style="s2">continually bridge between the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.690" end="00:39:03.729" style="s2">the existential and the ontological has</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.940" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">precisely been in religions religions in</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.729" end="00:39:08.410" style="s2">fact seem to be where you get that kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:10.539" style="s2">of distribute not only distributed</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.410" end="00:39:12.819" style="s2">synchronically across people but</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.539" end="00:39:15.339" style="s2">diachronic ly across time this is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.819" end="00:39:17.529" style="s2">whole religious idea of tradition right</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.339" end="00:39:20.829" style="s2">tradition seems to be that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.529" end="00:39:23.259" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about or or am I making a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.829" end="00:39:27.539" style="s2">mistake so I&#39;m hoping on it no yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.259" end="00:39:29.979" style="s2">tradition yes it&#39;s and the trouble is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.539" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">hiding as one and one of the essays</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.979" end="00:39:33.969" style="s2">that&#39;s not very well known behind it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:35.979" style="s2">on traditional language and technical</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.969" end="00:39:38.619" style="s2">language and it happens I hiding it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.979" end="00:39:41.309" style="s2">greatly in language we speak more and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.619" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">more and in terms that are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.309" end="00:39:45.070" style="s2">technical and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:47.500" style="s2">not no longer connected to the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.070" end="00:39:48.790" style="s2">poesis employees and of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.500" end="00:39:52.750" style="s2">connected to the sacred because the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.790" end="00:39:56.440" style="s2">sacred means is I would think means</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.750" end="00:39:59.230" style="s2">something that you you simply to let</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.440" end="00:40:01.570" style="s2">something occur to let something be let</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.230" end="00:40:03.640" style="s2">something shine in of itself and not</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.570" end="00:40:06.580" style="s2">want it to be in sheer available</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.640" end="00:40:08.650" style="s2">actuality for example um and about also</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.580" end="00:40:10.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a friend of mine francesca</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.650" end="00:40:12.130" style="s2">cottony which is published a book on</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.030" end="00:40:14.740" style="s2">Ottawa Nietzsche in Italian which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.130" end="00:40:17.320" style="s2">presented early they the presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.740" end="00:40:20.140" style="s2">gods right right and for also there</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.320" end="00:40:25.420" style="s2">there is this sheer presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.140" end="00:40:26.860" style="s2">divine in in beings and I&#39;m not sure so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.420" end="00:40:28.660" style="s2">with with Heidegger I think it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.860" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">different because for him the guards</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.660" end="00:40:34.600" style="s2">remain unnamed and they remain withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.970" style="s2">a bit to a certain degree and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.600" end="00:40:39.700" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to do at least on my reading</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.970" end="00:40:42.580" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s correct but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.700" end="00:40:45.610" style="s2">trying to do in the four fold is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.580" end="00:40:47.530" style="s2">remind us think about when he writes</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.610" end="00:40:50.500" style="s2">this fifties and sixties he gives public</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.530" end="00:40:52.660" style="s2">talks to engineers etc he tells at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.500" end="00:40:55.720" style="s2">time when there was a great believed</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.660" end="00:40:57.820" style="s2">that technology could save us liberate</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.720" end="00:41:01.270" style="s2">us once and for all we could have utopia</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.820" end="00:41:03.730" style="s2">and adora at the time and and love</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.270" end="00:41:06.670" style="s2">talked about how utopia would come about</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.730" end="00:41:08.830" style="s2">when we finally give up on death right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.670" end="00:41:11.350" style="s2">so once we become him also that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.830" end="00:41:14.860" style="s2">we have utopia well when death becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.350" end="00:41:18.430" style="s2">an option for those who want to die for</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.860" end="00:41:24.280" style="s2">whatever reason but in that time I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.430" end="00:41:26.170" style="s2">he reminds the human being of a simple</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.280" end="00:41:29.460" style="s2">truth of this capacity of being mortal</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.170" end="00:41:34.660" style="s2">and that capacity is only however</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.460" end="00:41:36.100" style="s2">possible to even think off when there</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.660" end="00:41:37.960" style="s2">are immortals for Heidegger you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.100" end="00:41:40.300" style="s2">never think one without the other right</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.960" end="00:41:43.240" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this so in hi I&#39;m Kenny</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.300" end="00:41:45.700" style="s2">in Trevor no I&#39;m means moon homely</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.240" end="00:41:48.700" style="s2">unholy so the world is unholy but it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.700" end="00:41:51.340" style="s2">also be homely and yeah that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.700" end="00:41:54.070" style="s2">wanted to get to you know okay because</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.340" end="00:41:56.050" style="s2">one of the things you know that Chris</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.070" end="00:41:56.470" style="s2">and I thought about is that the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.050" end="00:41:58.780" style="s2">seems</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.780" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">be a way of homing us against horror</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.750" end="00:42:06.790" style="s2">this is geertz&#39;s notion right of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.970" end="00:42:25.510" style="s2">is horror yeah exactly exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.040" end="00:42:27.580" style="s2">horror is so important because the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.510" end="00:42:29.590" style="s2">we think of horror is I mean just you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.580" end="00:42:31.990" style="s2">know everyday terms horror is a movie</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.590" end="00:42:34.090" style="s2">yeah yeah horror is something in a film</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.990" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">that&#39;s horrible for two hours and then I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.090" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">go home and maybe I have a bad dream but</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:38.520" style="s2">no horahora</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">and the weird thing is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.520" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">again thanks to mono economy not thanks</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:47.250" style="s2">then how does he define boredom he calls</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:52.380" style="s2">boredom the horror mark we the horror of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.250" end="00:42:56.290" style="s2">emptiness which is that perhaps a ride</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.380" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">in the horse cart is is rather dull</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.290" end="00:43:00.490" style="s2">right is incredibly bourgeois a</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.490" end="00:43:05.230" style="s2">but that horror of our cuy but he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:22.690" end="00:43:28.030" style="s2">could think of him for example here but</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.540" end="00:43:30.070" style="s2">but when you think of this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.030" end="00:43:32.200" style="s2">Heidegger again in terms of the history</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.070" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">of metaphysics metaphysics forgets</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.460" end="00:43:39.670" style="s2">forgets horror</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.720" end="00:43:41.460" style="s2">maybe this history forgets this sheer</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.670" end="00:43:45.099" style="s2">horror that also is at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.460" end="00:43:48.210" style="s2">existence not only but also well that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.099" end="00:43:51.250" style="s2">gives need to two connecting points is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.210" end="00:43:54.070" style="s2">the way to go back to circle effect</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.250" end="00:43:58.660" style="s2">immortality the way Eastern if there</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.070" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">were easy attic religions I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.660" end="00:44:06.609" style="s2">you know especially you know Indian and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:09.670" style="s2">Chinese especially Buddhist but but</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.609" end="00:44:10.360" style="s2">there&#39;s the horror of immortality yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.670" end="00:44:14.620" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.360" end="00:44:17.710" style="s2">which so you know when I talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.620" end="00:44:19.390" style="s2">in the West about this and I say I try</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.710" end="00:44:21.730" style="s2">to get them to understand this idea</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.390" end="00:44:23.830" style="s2">about the about how important your</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.730" end="00:44:26.650" style="s2">mortality is well no but you know we all</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.830" end="00:44:28.270" style="s2">know they&#39;ll say they&#39;ll say as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.650" end="00:44:30.250" style="s2">axiomatic but we all just want to live</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.270" end="00:44:32.020" style="s2">forever and I say well actually you</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.250" end="00:44:33.970" style="s2">don&#39;t and that&#39;s not true about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.020" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">cultures right other cultures actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.970" end="00:44:40.210" style="s2">experience the prospect of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:42.700" style="s2">as deeply deeply horrific and and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.210" end="00:44:44.170" style="s2">know you reincarnation for example is</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.700" end="00:44:48.070" style="s2">the thing you&#39;re trying to break free</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.170" end="00:44:50.050" style="s2">from in many versions of Hinduism and of</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.070" end="00:44:52.030" style="s2">CO and the same thing with sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:54.250" style="s2">desire for perpetual existence is what</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.030" end="00:44:58.300" style="s2">binds you into suffering within Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.250" end="00:44:59.560" style="s2">in profound ways and so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.300" end="00:45:00.580" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.560" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">connection I&#39;m trying to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.580" end="00:45:05.560" style="s2">to you is I think the absence of horror</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.280" end="00:45:09.400" style="s2">in our metaphysics is actually a telling</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.560" end="00:45:13.600" style="s2">thing I think it again points to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.400" end="00:45:17.290" style="s2">fact that we are ultimately seeking a</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.600" end="00:45:21.730" style="s2">kind of security for our intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.290" end="00:45:24.220" style="s2">rather than always trying to nourish our</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.730" end="00:45:26.370" style="s2">intelligibility through all and I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.220" end="00:45:32.140" style="s2">those are fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.370" end="00:45:35.140" style="s2">projects for us and that&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.140" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">security I think I and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.140" end="00:45:44.500" style="s2">think what the response to is I&#39;d agree</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:47.800" style="s2">to say the withdrawal of being through</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.500" end="00:45:50.110" style="s2">the withdrawal of sense right and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.800" end="00:45:54.280" style="s2">one of the things I liked in that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.110" end="00:45:58.110" style="s2">interview with your teacher he where he</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.280" end="00:46:01.660" style="s2">was talking about the our response right</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.110" end="00:46:03.670" style="s2">what is to to the withdrawal of sense is</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.660" end="00:46:07.600" style="s2">is a is it is to take this hyper</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.670" end="00:46:10.900" style="s2">morality position right oh great inside</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.600" end="00:46:15.360" style="s2">it where we go we we experience the loss</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.900" end="00:46:21.610" style="s2">of sense but we don&#39;t we don&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.360" end="00:46:23.770" style="s2">we we we we compensate for it by just</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.610" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">being really upset of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.770" end="00:46:28.630" style="s2">about things right and being offended</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:31.480" style="s2">about things and what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.630" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">you can notice that like rationality</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.480" end="00:46:37.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have it doesn&#39;t even consider</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:40.320" style="s2">rationality no no in that that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.000" end="00:46:43.540" style="s2">responds to the to the withdrawal of of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.320" end="00:46:46.780" style="s2">the sense of beingness of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.540" end="00:46:49.570" style="s2">fullness of things we we&#39;ve excluded</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.780" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">from our notion of rationality any sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.570" end="00:46:53.670" style="s2">of this whole side of the spectrum if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.760" style="s2">could put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.670" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">rationality has has been truncated to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.760" end="00:47:04.690" style="s2">confirmation coherence the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:07.030" style="s2">insight and transformation and a</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.690" end="00:47:08.380" style="s2">capacity for wonder in Plato&#39;s sense not</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.030" end="00:47:10.270" style="s2">Aristotle sense because I think for</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.380" end="00:47:12.520" style="s2">Aristotle it&#39;s for my curiosity for</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.270" end="00:47:14.620" style="s2">Plato it&#39;s clearly awe that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.520" end="00:47:16.600" style="s2">things are actually crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.620" end="00:47:18.610" style="s2">forgetting for example overcoming all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.600" end="00:47:20.560" style="s2">this self-deception that our ego</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.610" end="00:47:22.030" style="s2">centrism and our narcissism makes us</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.560" end="00:47:24.970" style="s2">pray to and they should therefore be</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.030" end="00:47:28.030" style="s2">central central to our ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.970" end="00:47:30.250" style="s2">rationality not peripheral things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.030" end="00:47:32.470" style="s2">are somehow romantically pursued when</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.250" end="00:47:35.530" style="s2">our rationality is done what it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.470" end="00:47:37.660" style="s2">do for the day I think that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.530" end="00:47:40.570" style="s2">crucial point what you just did god to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.660" end="00:47:42.460" style="s2">try and that way in which we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.570" end="00:47:44.230" style="s2">again this is again we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.460" end="00:47:45.490" style="s2">something ontological and then we shift</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.230" end="00:47:48.220" style="s2">into the existential and then it</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.490" end="00:47:49.240" style="s2">reverberates back into the cognitive now</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.220" end="00:47:51.940" style="s2">because now we&#39;re bringing up the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.240" end="00:47:54.310" style="s2">notion of what what does rationality</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.940" end="00:47:56.380" style="s2">because if if this is about you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.310" end="00:47:58.630" style="s2">sense making rationality should be in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.380" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">this discussion but obviously in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.630" end="00:48:06.550" style="s2">reformulated way so that it comports</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:08.500" style="s2">with what we&#39;re talking about well and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.550" end="00:48:12.760" style="s2">think one of the things that I&#39;m if I</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.500" end="00:48:16.990" style="s2">feel into it like if I I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.760" end="00:48:18.280" style="s2">the things I like about um about real</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.990" end="00:48:22.690" style="s2">what I&#39;ve gotten out of reading</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.280" end="00:48:25.570" style="s2">Heidegger more than his ideas or his</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.690" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">views and it&#39;s been to read them is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.570" end="00:48:32.170" style="s2">walk on the path of looking to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:35.050" style="s2">which reveals it&#39;s uncanny nasai wanted</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.170" end="00:48:37.040" style="s2">to ask you about that yeah it&#39;s a almost</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.050" end="00:48:39.800" style="s2">like it&#39;s been a practice for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.040" end="00:48:42.260" style="s2">well holy but I have found that to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.800" end="00:48:44.420" style="s2">the case and I think I did what I had to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.260" end="00:48:47.450" style="s2">go would actually like me saying this so</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.420" end="00:48:49.460" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe a bit of a a performative</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.450" end="00:48:51.410" style="s2">pun here I found that to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.460" end="00:48:53.630" style="s2">with all of the really great</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.410" end="00:48:58.040" style="s2">philosophers like I find you don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.630" end="00:48:59.570" style="s2">Spinoza yeah you you base you you you</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.040" end="00:49:02.810" style="s2">you I don&#39;t know what you immerse</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.810" end="00:49:05.450" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use this for because I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.130" end="00:49:06.920" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate you have to read you</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.510" end="00:49:22.970" style="s2">Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.110" end="00:49:24.890" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve missed the ethics I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.970" end="00:49:27.620" style="s2">you didn&#39;t missed the ethics yeah same</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.890" end="00:49:30.110" style="s2">thing with Plato right for like Plato is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.620" end="00:49:31.310" style="s2">sacred to me because like I think I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.110" end="00:49:35.030" style="s2">keep following Plato</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.310" end="00:49:37.220" style="s2">I can I can go to Plato I get insight I</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.030" end="00:49:39.830" style="s2">get transfer get the challenge to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.220" end="00:49:41.420" style="s2">transformation I go out in the world the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.830" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">world discloses itself to me in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.420" end="00:49:45.860" style="s2">that it couldn&#39;t before that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:47.540" style="s2">me I go back to Plato and then I see</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.860" end="00:49:50.870" style="s2">something again in Plato that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.540" end="00:49:52.220" style="s2">see and I can and so Plato engenders and</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.870" end="00:49:55.160" style="s2">agog a Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.220" end="00:49:58.310" style="s2">engenders can see Intuit Eva I think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.160" end="00:50:01.070" style="s2">great philosophers engender again this a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.310" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">state that&#39;s between and beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.070" end="00:50:05.330" style="s2">cognitive the existential and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:07.910" style="s2">ontological they put you into this place</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.330" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">I&#39;m struggling for words here that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.910" end="00:50:11.870" style="s2">captured by those categories and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:14.330" style="s2">the thing of any great philosopher is to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.870" end="00:50:17.570" style="s2">get to that place with them right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.330" end="00:50:18.020" style="s2">that&#39;s in mm right I think how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.570" end="00:50:21.380" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.020" end="00:50:27.800" style="s2">sorry guide you but the great</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.380" end="00:50:29.540" style="s2">philosophers yeah it&#39;s I think what</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.800" end="00:50:33.070" style="s2">you&#39;re describing is what you could call</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.540" end="00:50:37.660" style="s2">the apparition of thinking right this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.070" end="00:50:40.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t yes there&#39;s nothing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.660" end="00:50:43.880" style="s2">this is what I thought philosophy would</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.070" end="00:50:45.800" style="s2">be yes yes khadeem yeah and it was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.880" end="00:50:47.630" style="s2">like that medieval ditch and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.800" end="00:50:49.790" style="s2">need to leave but it&#39;s because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.630" end="00:50:50.340" style="s2">small University and I came here and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.790" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.340" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">friend but it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:58.350" style="s2">ultimately how philosophy should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:50:59.670" style="s2">taught but I don&#39;t care is it this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.350" end="00:51:01.830" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t that&#39;s not ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.670" end="00:51:05.130" style="s2">that important it&#39;s not that important</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.830" end="00:51:07.920" style="s2">what by the way you might disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.130" end="00:51:10.890" style="s2">Plato and some things of others but what</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.920" end="00:51:12.690" style="s2">is it then why is it these texts and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.890" end="00:51:14.850" style="s2">way we do and what is it that they do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.690" end="00:51:17.460" style="s2">with us and why do we why is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.850" end="00:51:19.890" style="s2">can come back to them again and again</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.460" end="00:51:22.110" style="s2">and the gamut must actually I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.890" end="00:51:24.180" style="s2">the cave at aghori I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.110" end="00:51:26.190" style="s2">time exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.180" end="00:51:27.630" style="s2">still I&#39;m reading it I could read every</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.190" end="00:51:31.290" style="s2">week and I would still all right I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.630" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">forgot oh really this is every single</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.290" end="00:51:36.210" style="s2">time that yes yeah God back to you</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:38.280" style="s2">because I cut you off I&#39;m sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.210" end="00:51:39.630" style="s2">that I just was wondering if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.280" end="00:51:41.790" style="s2">I think I really want to like I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.630" end="00:51:43.290" style="s2">this is exciting because it&#39;s drawing I</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.790" end="00:51:45.210" style="s2">think it maybe bringing something</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.290" end="00:51:50.610" style="s2">together if we look at what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.210" end="00:51:52.710" style="s2">happens in that relationship of reading</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.610" end="00:51:55.560" style="s2">of philosopher right like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.710" end="00:51:58.860" style="s2">exercising and I&#39;m wondering if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.560" end="00:52:01.380" style="s2">touches it on the ontological like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.860" end="00:52:04.080" style="s2">cognitive and the existential these</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.380" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">thrilling so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.080" end="00:52:10.560" style="s2">saying and and then and then for me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:12.120" style="s2">of course you probably first saw that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.560" end="00:52:15.330" style="s2">was going to do this guy this then</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.120" end="00:52:16.590" style="s2">translates also into deer logos as</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.330" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">something that&#39;s happening between</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.590" end="00:52:22.530" style="s2">people and also has that and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">something right there and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.530" end="00:52:26.370" style="s2">coincidence that you know Plato writes</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:28.350" style="s2">dialogues right that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.370" end="00:52:30.330" style="s2">coincidence that is not a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.350" end="00:52:33.090" style="s2">there&#39;s something about what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.330" end="00:52:36.390" style="s2">here and how you should read a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.090" end="00:52:37.950" style="s2">philosopher they need each other this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.390" end="00:52:39.510" style="s2">what I mean about when you know this</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.950" end="00:52:42.420" style="s2">work this is a deep meaning of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.510" end="00:52:44.270" style="s2">trying to I&#39;m trying to work on with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.420" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">guy about trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.270" end="00:52:49.140" style="s2">philosophy a-- not academic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.800" end="00:52:51.900" style="s2">but philosophy a-- into like into</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.140" end="00:52:55.710" style="s2">circling and to get the two of them you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.900" end="00:52:57.690" style="s2">know working together you know the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.710" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the circling feeds</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.690" end="00:53:02.520" style="s2">into reading the philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:04.140" style="s2">reading the philosophers feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.520" end="00:53:06.900" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.140" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the project I&#39;m alright</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.900" end="00:53:14.130" style="s2">now exam with you right does all the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:16.470" style="s2">text they send you</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.470" end="00:53:20.520" style="s2">one you gave me I&#39;m sorry it was R it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.230" end="00:53:23.730" style="s2">was very good by the way it was very</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.520" end="00:53:26.250" style="s2">good so I think that I think the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.730" end="00:53:27.480" style="s2">about well it&#39;s actually like bringing</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.250" end="00:53:29.700" style="s2">in the conversation that he had with</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.480" end="00:53:32.660" style="s2">Andrew what I was writing with you about</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.700" end="00:53:36.330" style="s2">a second conversation a conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.660" end="00:53:42.110" style="s2">really really got at a deeper level this</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.330" end="00:53:46.350" style="s2">this sense of what was it um how</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.110" end="00:53:48.690" style="s2">rationality is rationing for where to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.350" end="00:53:49.740" style="s2">bring your attention that reveals wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.690" end="00:53:52.740" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.740" end="00:53:56.910" style="s2">yeah the rationing and the ratty oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.740" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s it has as much to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.910" end="00:54:03.570" style="s2">with logistics as it does to do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:05.400" style="s2">logic yeah and and and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.570" end="00:54:06.870" style="s2">proportioning is it&#39;s like just a copy</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.400" end="00:54:09.180" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.870" end="00:54:11.580" style="s2">proportioning it&#39;s like it&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.180" end="00:54:14.670" style="s2">four fold the correct proportioning of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.580" end="00:54:15.150" style="s2">human beings to the gods and to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.670" end="00:54:18.090" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.150" end="00:54:20.910" style="s2">that&#39;s ratty oh right that&#39;s right here</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.090" end="00:54:23.640" style="s2">right because it&#39;s closer to it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.910" end="00:54:26.430" style="s2">closer like I say to logos and all that</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.640" end="00:54:28.980" style="s2">was you know the best best word from</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.430" end="00:54:31.620" style="s2">another culture is Dharma Dharma is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.980" end="00:54:35.700" style="s2">word like in Buddhism that has all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.620" end="00:54:37.800" style="s2">that kind of sense do it right yes and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.700" end="00:54:41.490" style="s2">that just I just really just got that</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.800" end="00:54:45.890" style="s2">sense of oh that there&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.490" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of listening right that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.890" end="00:54:51.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a way it seems like listening</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">seems to be the right metaphor here</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.810" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">right I like harkening better</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:58.650" style="s2">I like your harkening better because for</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:04.650" style="s2">me harkening carries with it the sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.650" end="00:55:08.310" style="s2">of also a receptivity and and and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.650" end="00:55:11.490" style="s2">making one&#39;s oneself sensitive lul most</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.310" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">vulnerable and opening and listening</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.490" end="00:55:15.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t connote that for me the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:17.700" style="s2">harkening de because hearken ii like</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.660" end="00:55:22.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit in your harken is a</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.170" end="00:55:25.950" style="s2">that there&#39;s something about it where is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.150" end="00:55:28.890" style="s2">where I think this is starts to Britt</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.950" end="00:55:32.250" style="s2">this is starts to be break free of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.890" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">metaphysics right mmm because it&#39;s it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.250" end="00:55:37.470" style="s2">here is is to be unclear about what</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:40.680" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing but yet to be a tune to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.470" end="00:55:44.490" style="s2">what you can&#39;t quite make out yet right</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.680" end="00:55:45.840" style="s2">that would whispering to you and to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.490" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">be or because this is one of things I</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.840" end="00:55:49.620" style="s2">noticed encircling and leading circling</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:51.420" style="s2">of just I noticed this last weekend is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.620" end="00:55:54.510" style="s2">just sitting with people and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.420" end="00:55:56.850" style="s2">harkening so what is the what are they</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.510" end="00:56:00.630" style="s2">what what&#39;s really present what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.850" end="00:56:03.030" style="s2">present and just good evening into that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.630" end="00:56:06.660" style="s2">is I can I kept feeling this sense of in</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.030" end="00:56:09.210" style="s2">this growing sense of tuning in to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.660" end="00:56:09.710" style="s2">movement of showing or something like</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.210" end="00:56:12.810" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.710" end="00:56:15.720" style="s2">that&#39;s in is there&#39;s an orientation that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.810" end="00:56:17.730" style="s2">just keeps drawing it it has an auto</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.720" end="00:56:20.250" style="s2">poetic quality to it guys</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.730" end="00:56:24.030" style="s2">object is not looking for an object or</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.250" end="00:56:26.610" style="s2">an answer it&#39;s something else just at</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.030" end="00:56:29.880" style="s2">the edge of intelligibility or it</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.610" end="00:56:32.070" style="s2">reminds me I was circling last night it</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.880" end="00:56:33.720" style="s2">remind I so I said I want to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.070" end="00:56:35.700" style="s2">circle where it goes but I was invoking</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.720" end="00:56:37.620" style="s2">Socrates is a point of follow the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.700" end="00:56:40.140" style="s2">argument wherever it goes that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.620" end="00:56:42.030" style="s2">that&#39;s the that kind of sense yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.140" end="00:56:43.110" style="s2">wanna I want to hear what you wanted us</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.030" end="00:56:44.420" style="s2">to say but I want to ask you one</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.110" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">question guy first</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.420" end="00:56:50.070" style="s2">so and this goes to the point we were</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:54.030" style="s2">just on I don&#39;t want to leave you yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.070" end="00:56:56.130" style="s2">because I sort of brought this up like</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.030" end="00:57:00.060" style="s2">sort of post circling I would say saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.130" end="00:57:04.050" style="s2">you know we&#39;re hearkening to each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.060" end="00:57:05.970" style="s2">and we&#39;re even harkening you know to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.050" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">third factor that&#39;s opening between us</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.970" end="00:57:11.490" style="s2">but but it seems to me there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:14.910" style="s2">like I said you know I have an</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.490" end="00:57:16.500" style="s2">allegiance to to you the people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.910" end="00:57:20.750" style="s2">circling with an allegiance to or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.500" end="00:57:22.440" style="s2">process but I also want to be able to I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.750" end="00:57:24.840" style="s2">think this is part of being an</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.440" end="00:57:28.800" style="s2">authentically participating it I want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.840" end="00:57:31.030" style="s2">be able to engage my allegiance to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.800" end="00:57:34.930" style="s2">topics that might emerge</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.030" end="00:57:38.080" style="s2">yes so for example one one person sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.930" end="00:57:39.960" style="s2">of brought up sort of brought the</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.080" end="00:57:41.170" style="s2">circling practice itself into question</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.960" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.170" end="00:57:44.110" style="s2">right and what happened is people just</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:45.910" style="s2">did the circling and they sort of tune</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.110" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">into each other and I was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.910" end="00:57:51.010" style="s2">you know no I didn&#39;t that no no no no</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a no that&#39;s a lost opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.010" end="00:57:57.610" style="s2">you know we we should keep the circle</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">going but they&#39;re you know that person</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.610" end="00:58:02.710" style="s2">wants to wonder about circling rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:04.390" style="s2">than just wonder within circling and</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.710" end="00:58:06.490" style="s2">those aren&#39;t the same thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.390" end="00:58:08.200" style="s2">should be put into a dialogue with each</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.490" end="00:58:11.140" style="s2">other and you know what is it what does</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.200" end="00:58:12.340" style="s2">that mean like to subtract and like and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.140" end="00:58:14.460" style="s2">you know and then what happened is we</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.340" end="00:58:17.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t started this discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.460" end="00:58:19.420" style="s2">circling which you know that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.470" end="00:58:21.220" style="s2">mean about again trying to get these</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.420" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">things to talk to each other we should</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.220" end="00:58:24.600" style="s2">both let Johannes say something though</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:29.800" style="s2">he&#39;s been very patient and kind with us</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.600" end="00:58:32.350" style="s2">I think just briefly on harkening I had</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.800" end="00:58:36.010" style="s2">not thought of this I&#39;d always just you</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.350" end="00:58:39.730" style="s2">know use the word to listen to I will</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.010" end="00:58:43.260" style="s2">from now on say harken it&#39;s also much</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.730" end="00:58:46.960" style="s2">closer to Hulk and</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.260" end="00:58:49.150" style="s2">Hulk right which is listen</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.960" end="00:58:52.540" style="s2">but harken in a proper that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.150" end="00:58:55.060" style="s2">now really hear what I&#39;m saying yes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.540" end="00:58:56.650" style="s2">what we now think of as the third where</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.060" end="00:58:58.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve classified as the first fragment</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.650" end="00:59:00.460" style="s2">of Heraclitus livid actually was his</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.120" end="00:59:04.750" style="s2">first fragment we don&#39;t know he speaks</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.460" end="00:59:08.050" style="s2">of a cooing he speaks of the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.750" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">that we yes yes we are in a hearing</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.050" end="00:59:12.220" style="s2">stance to the MILCON yeah yeah but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:15.010" style="s2">not listening or now I would say</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.220" end="00:59:18.130" style="s2">harkening yeah so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.010" end="00:59:22.840" style="s2">oldest wisdoms that we have or</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.130" end="00:59:25.780" style="s2">right testimonials of logos is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.840" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">logos can be hearkened there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.780" end="00:59:30.370" style="s2">as always a hearing that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:34.120" style="s2">something addressing us calling us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.370" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">but what we must do is respond we must</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.120" end="00:59:38.740" style="s2">respond and that&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:39.840" style="s2">beautifully in English to say this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.740" end="00:59:43.210" style="s2">because you can say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.840" end="00:59:44.869" style="s2">responsibility yes there is this deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.210" end="00:59:47.599" style="s2">sense of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.869" end="00:59:49.430" style="s2">you mustn&#39;t be cut off from and it has</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:51.650" style="s2">to do Altima Lee I think with with with</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.430" end="00:59:54.319" style="s2">the ecstatic temporalities of history</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.650" end="00:59:57.769" style="s2">itself that&#39;s something that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.319" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">see in encircling happening because it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.769" end="01:00:03.470" style="s2">works with what has been comes back</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:05.029" style="s2">towards you the old time right this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.470" end="01:00:07.759" style="s2">all the time and I think this is how</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.029" end="01:00:10.339" style="s2">this really works itself and what what</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.759" end="01:00:15.619" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve we&#39;ve made linear</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.339" end="01:00:18.910" style="s2">history and assume that we just move on</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.619" end="01:00:22.279" style="s2">into an empty feel that we can that will</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.910" end="01:00:24.440" style="s2">rearrange and make make it just around</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.279" end="01:00:27.009" style="s2">where we please and we&#39;ve completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.440" end="01:00:31.519" style="s2">forgotten that that which has been is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.009" end="01:00:33.950" style="s2">still coming back and maybe not just you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.519" end="01:00:37.329" style="s2">know to haunt us but also to give us</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.950" end="01:00:37.329" style="s2">again a sense of direction</p>
