<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.410" style="s2">okay so today what I want to do is talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.460" end="00:00:06.299" style="s2">about a what I think is actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.410" end="00:00:08.340" style="s2">very deep concept that I learned about</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.299" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">in a book called the secret of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">success by Joseph Henrich and I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">some links to the book down below and</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">he&#39;s actually got a number of really</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:20.760" style="s2">good talks on YouTube so I&#39;ll put a link</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:22.619" style="s2">to a couple of those videos as well the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.760" end="00:00:26.340" style="s2">concept here is the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.619" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">dominance and prestige and the role of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.340" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">that distinction plays in culture and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.189" end="00:00:35.700" style="s2">cultural revolution okay so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">here begins with the insight that human</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">beings have very few hardwired instincts</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:44.070" style="s2">unlike most of other animals which are</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">born reasonably well capable of quickly</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.070" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">becoming functional human beings as we</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:51.660" style="s2">know important pretty helpless and one</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:53.430" style="s2">of the very few instincts that were able</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:56.969" style="s2">to consistently find that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.430" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">hardwired really as far back as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">been able to look so far even like one</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">or two months as far as I know is a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">very interesting and unique</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">characteristic in humans and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:13.909" style="s2">that from a very early age human beings</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">are very hard wired to endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.909" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">identify who they should pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">to and they do it by figuring out or</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">identifying who everybody else is paying</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">attention to when I suppose in idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">social attention allocation so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">imagine a two-month-old even a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">two-month-old will be scanning the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">environment to identify who in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">environment is worth paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">and then will endeavor to anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.020" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">whatever they can grasp of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">on over there particularly or start</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:46.890" style="s2">intimidating behaviors with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">expectation or the hope that some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.890" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">those behaviors might in fact be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">ones that are why they&#39;re the subject of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">social attention and therefore worth</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">emulating and so it&#39;s a kind of a crude</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">tool for collectively figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">are the right kinds of things to do but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">I guess the point is that so far as we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">can tell it seems to be the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">key that enabled Homo sapiens to develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">culture now there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">stuff we could do on just that but what</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:16.799" style="s2">I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">about is the the two different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.799" end="00:02:21.540" style="s2">social hierarchies that emerged in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">context so the first kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.540" end="00:02:24.989" style="s2">hierarchy is is relatively commonly</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:26.849" style="s2">discussed these days and browns of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.989" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">people understood and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.849" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">dominance hierarchy that&#39;s the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">and all social animals have this</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:36.780" style="s2">particular structure particularly among</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">males where the ability to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.780" end="00:02:41.879" style="s2">effective use of physical strength</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:43.700" style="s2">allows a particular male to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.879" end="00:02:45.870" style="s2">dominance of other males and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.700" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">Authority in the social structure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.870" end="00:02:50.329" style="s2">cascades down in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:52.799" style="s2">hierarchical element that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.329" end="00:02:53.879" style="s2">coarse brush of the of the concept I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.799" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">don&#39;t want to spend a whole lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.879" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">there as I said it&#39;s it&#39;s not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">to grasp these days the important part</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:04.829" style="s2">is the the other kind of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:06.299" style="s2">because as far as as we can tell are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:07.530" style="s2">these as far as I know who based on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.299" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">formations that I&#39;ve been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.530" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">this particular hierarchical approach is</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:14.489" style="s2">unique among humans and is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">distinctly associated with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.489" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">we&#39;re a cultural animal and Henry calls</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:22.829" style="s2">this the the prestige hierarchy and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:25.650" style="s2">what happens to this in the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.829" end="00:03:29.940" style="s2">hierarchy is this is dynamic especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.650" end="00:03:32.669" style="s2">with this hardwired habit which is those</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.940" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">individual members of the group who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.669" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">most attended to by the other members of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">the group therefore end up on the top of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:48.269" style="s2">the prestige hierarchy and have a social</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">status that is comparable to not</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.269" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">necessarily the same as the comparable</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:56.209" style="s2">to individuals who at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:04:00.599" style="s2">dominance hierarchy so humans as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.209" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">tribal obligate pack animal have two</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.599" end="00:04:04.139" style="s2">distinct hierarchies that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:07.139" style="s2">simultaneously and a large part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.139" end="00:04:10.500" style="s2">complexity of our social environment are</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.139" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">in fact based upon that tension that on</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.500" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">the one hand we are at a deep man</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.699" style="s2">million level attuned to dominance</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:18.810" style="s2">displays and dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.699" end="00:04:20.789" style="s2">trying to figure out where we live in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.810" end="00:04:23.219" style="s2">that picking order but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.789" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">at a human level we are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.219" end="00:04:27.630" style="s2">seeking to find out who we should be</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.919" end="00:04:29.490" style="s2">paying attention to and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.630" end="00:04:32.760" style="s2">should be emulating along the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.490" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">hierarchy now notice the distinct ways</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.760" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">that one goes about navigating this</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:38.250" style="s2">heart is and how the heart is play out</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:40.230" style="s2">so we just did one example</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.250" end="00:04:44.580" style="s2">Hendrix example and that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.230" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">the relationship between dominant and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.580" end="00:04:48.480" style="s2">non-dominant males and high prestige and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">non high prestige males in the two</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.480" end="00:04:54.480" style="s2">hierarchies so in a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">non dominant males really quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.480" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">distinctly want to go out of their way</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">making the acquaintance with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:02.790" style="s2">dominant male you don&#39;t want to get his</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">attempt you don&#39;t want to make eye</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.790" end="00:05:06.270" style="s2">contact you avoid it at all costs</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">because that will be perceived as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.270" end="00:05:08.820" style="s2">dominance challenge and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">consequently involve some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.820" end="00:05:14.480" style="s2">dominance conflict which by hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:16.200" style="s2">here you&#39;ll lose now of course in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.480" end="00:05:17.880" style="s2">context there&#39;s not a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.200" end="00:05:19.230" style="s2">learning that can take place right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.880" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">very difficult to learn from someone if</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.230" end="00:05:22.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t even make eye contact with</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.380" style="s2">them if you&#39;re trying to avoid proximity</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.440" end="00:05:28.100" style="s2">to them by contrast in the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.380" end="00:05:31.410" style="s2">hierarchy the whole point is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">connection and communication so the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.410" end="00:05:36.750" style="s2">low prestige males are consistently</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.420" style="s2">seeking who they should be attending to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.750" end="00:05:42.480" style="s2">and then endeavouring to find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.420" end="00:05:46.260" style="s2">cultivate an opportunity to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.480" end="00:05:47.730" style="s2">proximity of hyper Steve males so that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.260" end="00:05:48.780" style="s2">they can have an opportunity to emulate</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.730" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">whatever it is the causes them to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.780" end="00:05:53.340" style="s2">high prestige I&#39;m so if you if a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:56.550" style="s2">particular male happens to be notably</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.340" end="00:05:58.890" style="s2">good at chipping hand axes and that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.550" end="00:06:00.390" style="s2">getting him a lot of attention then as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.890" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">young male you see that attention you</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.390" end="00:06:04.640" style="s2">you&#39;re glued to him and you get near by</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.170" style="s2">him and try to figure out how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:08.760" style="s2">absorb this knowledge and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.170" end="00:06:10.200" style="s2">Ben enables transfer of knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.760" end="00:06:11.760" style="s2">occur and then transfer of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.200" end="00:06:14.910" style="s2">enables the development and propagation</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.760" end="00:06:16.410" style="s2">of culture but the last part is the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.910" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">important part and that is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.410" end="00:06:21.000" style="s2">relationship of the high prestige male</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.000" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">because if the high prestige male</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:27.450" style="s2">behaves in the same way that the hot the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">dominant male behaves it&#39;ll break down</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.450" end="00:06:32.450" style="s2">the dynamic so the high prestige male</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">has to allow in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.450" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">pacifically benefit from the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:40.730" style="s2">conflict and the presence of the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.780" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">males who are endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.730" end="00:06:47.570" style="s2">emulate his skills so the high prestige</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">mail far from optimizing for and tuning</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.570" end="00:06:56.750" style="s2">for dominance optimizes in Tunes for</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:58.820" style="s2">teaching and for skillfully separating</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.750" end="00:07:02.510" style="s2">those individual mails who in fact be to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.820" end="00:07:04.310" style="s2">his benefit to interact with and to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.510" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">increase his capacity to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.310" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">in a mating resource generation and just</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:11.930" style="s2">staying a lot you know who&#39;s good to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">on his team and so in as if happening is</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.930" end="00:07:16.660" style="s2">that the the skill set of the high</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:21.050" style="s2">prestige mail is in what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.660" end="00:07:23.690" style="s2">ethical leadership or in in teaching</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.050" end="00:07:25.940" style="s2">which is a far cry from the skill set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.690" end="00:07:27.290" style="s2">the dominance mail and of course I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.940" end="00:07:29.870" style="s2">articulating this all in the mail</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.290" end="00:07:31.460" style="s2">framework there are various horrible</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.870" end="00:07:35.510" style="s2">relationships and the female framework</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.460" end="00:07:38.750" style="s2">and then in mixed mechanisms as well for</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.510" end="00:07:41.650" style="s2">sure but the the male hierarchies are a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.750" end="00:07:47.110" style="s2">bit easier to grasp as a single example</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.650" end="00:07:51.320" style="s2">so so to recap human beings seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.110" end="00:07:54.500" style="s2">uniquely distinguished in evolution from</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.320" end="00:07:58.340" style="s2">other primates from another hominids</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.500" end="00:08:00.580" style="s2">from other mammals in that we have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.340" end="00:08:03.830" style="s2">hardwired in a very deep way and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.580" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">singularly for this notion of attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.830" end="00:08:11.240" style="s2">of social attention and of emulation</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.520" end="00:08:12.920" style="s2">this is related to connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.240" end="00:08:15.190" style="s2">emergence of a completely separate</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.920" end="00:08:18.680" style="s2">social hierarchical framework around</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.190" end="00:08:21.500" style="s2">prestige prestige and dominance run</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.680" end="00:08:23.750" style="s2">simultaneously in Homo sapiens and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.500" end="00:08:26.450" style="s2">tension between prestige and dominance</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.750" end="00:08:28.610" style="s2">is quite significant in understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.450" end="00:08:31.850" style="s2">the complexity of human social</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.610" end="00:08:35.479" style="s2">relationships I guess the last note</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.850" end="00:08:39.950" style="s2">since done this pretty quickly is to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.479" end="00:08:43.040" style="s2">that if you imagine the kinds of social</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.950" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">dynamics that are associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.040" end="00:08:50.600" style="s2">effective control of rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:53.960" style="s2">resources you&#39;ll notice that dominance</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.600" end="00:08:54.350" style="s2">is actually a pretty good approach you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.960" end="00:08:56.780" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.350" end="00:09:00.590" style="s2">what I want to do is control a watering</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.780" end="00:09:03.470" style="s2">hole the dominance is is the approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.590" end="00:09:09.860" style="s2">they don&#39;t take whereas if the endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.470" end="00:09:12.010" style="s2">is to generate antivirus resources then</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">postage is the right approach to take</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.010" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">and so it may be in fact that this</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:21.500" style="s2">distinction between rival risk and anti</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:23.300" style="s2">rather as&#39; is directly related now this</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.500" end="00:09:26.960" style="s2">is a proposition that I&#39;d put out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.300" end="00:09:28.810" style="s2">to consider to the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.960" end="00:09:32.180" style="s2">the dominance and the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.810" end="00:09:34.870" style="s2">approaches and that I would go further</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.180" end="00:09:37.400" style="s2">and proposed it is precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:41.510" style="s2">selection gradient associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.400" end="00:09:44.990" style="s2">ability to grasp and advance along the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.510" end="00:09:50.330" style="s2">anti rivals frontier that gave rise to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.990" end="00:09:52.070" style="s2">the niche of prestige and that we now</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.330" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">are in a co-evolutionary dynamic between</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.070" end="00:09:59.510" style="s2">the prestige gradient to the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:02.990" style="s2">selection gradient and the antivirus</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.510" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">Misha all right ten minutes that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.990" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">hope it&#39;s useful</p>
