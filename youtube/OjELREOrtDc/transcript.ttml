<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">interesting interesting topic near and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">dear to both of our hearts I would say</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">we both love hate speech Oh ma&#39;am yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:55.170" style="s2">so I read on Twitter yes that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.170" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">what&#39;s on your mind these days oh gosh</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:02.520" style="s2">what&#39;s on my mind these days politics as</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">usual I&#39;m thinking a lot about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.520" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">Democratic race for president I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">thinking a lot about how I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:10.710" style="s2">Democrats are failing the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:12.659" style="s2">race for president and the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.710" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">establishment I&#39;m thinking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.659" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">how it seems like we learned very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">few lessons from 2016 and see my</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">destined to repeat the same errors so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking about me--don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">Democrats always mess up the race for</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:28.890" style="s2">president I mean isn&#39;t that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:31.380" style="s2">their role I Democrats do have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.890" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">barrier to success in Republicans I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.380" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">the system is built to support rural</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">places the Electoral College you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">it&#39;s real but instead of acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">that in dealing with the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:44.850" style="s2">things like the electoral college the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">Democrats just seem to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.850" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">which this year is you know the top</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">candidates are moving further and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:56.600" style="s2">further to the left&#39;s I think to appeal</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.100" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">to the media which is far more liberal</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.600" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">leftist than the voting populous so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">really a catch-22 you know they have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:06.600" style="s2">appeal to the sort of people like me who</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">work in the media these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.600" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">gatekeepers who determine whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">you get the attention required to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">the name recognition whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.250" style="s2">required to win the primary</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:17.050" style="s2">and then if they win the primary they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.250" end="00:02:19.150" style="s2">dealt with or they have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.050" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">fact that you just you know came out for</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.150" end="00:02:23.620" style="s2">non-binary driver&#39;s license or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:26.260" style="s2">the thing is that&#39;s not going to appeal</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.620" end="00:02:27.430" style="s2">to the you know the six districts in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.260" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">Pennsylvania that are going to determine</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.430" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">who the next president is yeah and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:38.170" style="s2">pivot to the right and they prove it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:39.910" style="s2">the right so yeah so I have been quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.170" end="00:02:43.600" style="s2">frustrated with the Democratic Party for</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.910" end="00:02:46.810" style="s2">decades now and I remain nominally a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.600" end="00:02:49.570" style="s2">member of it because of the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.810" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2">politics and the fact that one reduces</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.570" end="00:02:53.800" style="s2">their say over the system if you walk</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:55.300" style="s2">away from the major parties but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.800" end="00:02:59.800" style="s2">described myself as the most reluctant</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.300" end="00:03:02.800" style="s2">Democrat and I do think that the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.800" end="00:03:06.670" style="s2">election established that there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.800" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">enough momentum behind the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.670" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">breaking out of our paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">something new could happen now which</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:17.950" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been possible I&#39;d say 15</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.000" end="00:03:23.140" style="s2">years ago but I do wonder if we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.950" end="00:03:25.060" style="s2">actually do something to step away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.140" end="00:03:26.950" style="s2">the Democratic Party and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.060" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">there is of course a walkaway movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.950" end="00:03:30.670" style="s2">which is disguise for walking towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:35.800" style="s2">the Republican Party which is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.670" end="00:03:40.540" style="s2">no better but is there a play where</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.800" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">those of us who have seen substantive</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.540" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">change of the kind that we would desire</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:49.480" style="s2">frustrated year in and year out for well</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:52.330" style="s2">essentially the entirety of your life</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.480" end="00:03:56.850" style="s2">and almost the entirety of mine</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.330" end="00:04:03.040" style="s2">is there a move in which we actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.850" end="00:04:06.959" style="s2">gain some influence over government and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.040" end="00:04:09.880" style="s2">move it in the direction of honorable</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.959" end="00:04:11.560" style="s2">progressive policies I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.880" end="00:04:13.540" style="s2">seeing right now the opposite happened I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.560" end="00:04:15.340" style="s2">think we&#39;re seeing a sort of we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.540" end="00:04:18.489" style="s2">seeing a kind of revolution but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.340" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">revolution on going to the far left part</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.489" end="00:04:22.210" style="s2">of the party people like aoc who has</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:23.860" style="s2">sort of sucked all the attention out of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.210" end="00:04:27.420" style="s2">the room despite being a you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.860" end="00:04:30.310" style="s2">freshman freshman congressperson</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.420" end="00:04:33.100" style="s2">so I I don&#39;t know I&#39;m maybe not as</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.310" end="00:04:35.950" style="s2">optimistic as you are you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.100" end="00:04:38.050" style="s2">problem with the walkaway movement as</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.950" end="00:04:39.430" style="s2">you mentioned is that you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.050" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">away from one thing and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:43.960" style="s2">something worse that&#39;s not a solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:46.570" style="s2">and I have a lot of frustration with</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.960" end="00:04:49.960" style="s2">with people like for instance des Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.570" end="00:04:51.640" style="s2">who sort of it&#39;s maybe I agree with him</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.960" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">when it comes to the Democrats but his</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.640" end="00:04:54.790" style="s2">solution said that seems to be pushing</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.950" style="s2">two people to the right and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.790" end="00:04:59.590" style="s2">think that&#39;s the solution so for me what</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.950" end="00:05:02.140" style="s2">I would like to do it as I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.590" end="00:05:05.170" style="s2">see people like us kind of old-school</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.140" end="00:05:06.780" style="s2">liberals stand up and say that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.170" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">like the direction the party is taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">this is why we need to move it into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">place of going back to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:19.270" style="s2">classical liberal values of tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:21.910" style="s2">for diversity of ideas free speech due</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.270" end="00:05:24.100" style="s2">process but I&#39;m not seeing that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.910" end="00:05:25.930" style="s2">seeing instead is people incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.100" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">frustrated by the sort of the locus of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.930" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">the Democratic Party essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:32.350" style="s2">registering a you vote they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:33.610" style="s2">gonna go vote for Donald Trump just to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.350" end="00:05:36.280" style="s2">say you to the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.610" end="00:05:38.020" style="s2">yeah which unfortunately I understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.280" end="00:05:38.230" style="s2">more than I would like to I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.020" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.230" end="00:05:43.300" style="s2">I spoke to it to a trump supporter a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">former Democrat who considered himself a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">lifelong Trump supporter a working-class</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.470" end="00:05:48.580" style="s2">guy who voted for Donald Trump and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.020" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">interviewed him a couple weeks ago and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.580" end="00:05:52.090" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna talk to him for the next year</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:53.800" style="s2">until the election and check in and see</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.090" end="00:05:55.240" style="s2">how this guy my goal is to change one</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.800" end="00:05:58.180" style="s2">person&#39;s vote so I&#39;m trying to change</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.240" end="00:05:59.650" style="s2">this guy so and he explained to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.180" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">not about policy it was never about</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.650" end="00:06:03.160" style="s2">policy he hated Hillary Clinton because</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:04.570" style="s2">she was elitist she was condescending</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.160" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">and she called half the country</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.570" end="00:06:10.750" style="s2">deplorable and it&#39;s so and he recognized</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">that this is counterproductive to his</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">not actually fighting for the workingman</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:19.270" style="s2">right but he hated Hillary Clinton and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.650" style="s2">don&#39;t think people realize how strong</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.270" end="00:06:23.590" style="s2">that is and maybe part of it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.650" end="00:06:25.210" style="s2">sexism maybe I don&#39;t know for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.590" end="00:06:27.370" style="s2">reason people have hated her in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.210" end="00:06:29.530" style="s2">particular for the past thirty years and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.370" end="00:06:31.540" style="s2">that didn&#39;t change when she was running</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.530" end="00:06:33.040" style="s2">for president obviously I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.540" end="00:06:34.210" style="s2">one of the problems Elizabeth Warren is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.040" end="00:06:35.350" style="s2">that she looks too much like Hillary</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.210" end="00:06:36.880" style="s2">Clinton and they don&#39;t really look alike</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.350" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">but they sort of look like you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.880" end="00:06:39.700" style="s2">sleep loosely well I must say I have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.010" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.700" end="00:06:43.990" style="s2">visceral response to Hillary Clinton I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.010" end="00:06:46.510" style="s2">had the same response to Bill Clinton I</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.990" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">was never for one minute a Bill Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.510" end="00:06:52.360" style="s2">fan there are things I found remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:54.790" style="s2">about him I think he was very eloquent</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.360" end="00:06:57.100" style="s2">and he did speak to something in people</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.790" end="00:07:00.700" style="s2">but I just don&#39;t trust him and I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.100" end="00:07:07.330" style="s2">don&#39;t trust her and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.700" end="00:07:09.670" style="s2">Trump is he did successfully muscle out</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.330" end="00:07:12.370" style="s2">of the way the crime families that had</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.670" end="00:07:14.500" style="s2">been holding us hostage for so long but</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.370" end="00:07:17.650" style="s2">basically he&#39;s a new crime family right</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.500" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s stupider one in a more corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.650" end="00:07:23.350" style="s2">one I think or worse at this and much</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:25.480" style="s2">more inclined to gamble big right which</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.350" end="00:07:27.670" style="s2">you know he likes to gamble big take</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.480" end="00:07:29.230" style="s2">credit when it works out and then he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.670" end="00:07:32.920" style="s2">not gonna be left holding the bag for</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.230" end="00:07:34.990" style="s2">when it goes south which it will so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.920" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">not a viable answer to this question</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.990" end="00:07:45.060" style="s2">right nor is he you know I just I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:48.280" style="s2">he&#39;s just not up to the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.060" end="00:07:50.200" style="s2">thinking on behalf of other people right</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.280" end="00:07:52.630" style="s2">and you know I wish he was and in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.200" end="00:07:54.070" style="s2">will confess that the the night he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.630" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">elected where we were all stunned</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.070" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">because he you know whether you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.500" end="00:07:59.410" style="s2">him to win or didn&#39;t want him to win we</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:01.150" style="s2">all thought he was going to lose or</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.410" end="00:08:02.640" style="s2">almost all of us did and then to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.150" end="00:08:06.460" style="s2">discover that he had won was just</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.640" end="00:08:10.180" style="s2">totally stunning but I said to Heather I</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:12.760" style="s2">said you know I&#39;m not expecting it but</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.180" end="00:08:15.130" style="s2">given the cards that he has if he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.760" end="00:08:18.310" style="s2">to become the greatest president in US</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.130" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">history starting from this moment he</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.310" end="00:08:23.830" style="s2">could do it right what he&#39;s done is he</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:25.420" style="s2">has actually gotten through a style of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.830" end="00:08:28.450" style="s2">gatekeeping designed to keep anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.420" end="00:08:30.130" style="s2">like him out of the office and now if he</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.450" end="00:08:33.010" style="s2">wanted to you know if he pulled off the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.130" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">mask and did something visionary there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.010" end="00:08:38.380" style="s2">be no stopping him well do you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:40.090" style="s2">that if even if he had people would be</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.380" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">happy about that I mean Trump has</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.090" end="00:08:42.310" style="s2">occasionally done a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">right yep</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.310" end="00:08:45.820" style="s2">and the response of that isn&#39;t to like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:48.130" style="s2">pat him on the back it&#39;s a it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.820" end="00:08:50.650" style="s2">decide for anyone right right which I I</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.130" end="00:08:52.850" style="s2">just find a counterproductive in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.650" end="00:08:54.319" style="s2">of ways I mean things like sentencing or</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.850" end="00:08:55.579" style="s2">where I&#39;m granted he didn&#39;t do this out</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.319" end="00:08:56.600" style="s2">of the goodness of his heart he did it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.579" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">because the people pulling his strings</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.600" end="00:08:59.959" style="s2">told him to do it yeah but still we</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:01.490" style="s2">should say it doesn&#39;t matter who the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.959" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">person is when the when the person in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.490" end="00:09:05.630" style="s2">power does a correct thing we should</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:09.670" style="s2">encourage that well let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.630" end="00:09:13.130" style="s2">way if he had done it he would have had</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.670" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">whatever this thing is that is emerging</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.130" end="00:09:17.509" style="s2">outside of the mainstream media the real</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:19.430" style="s2">conversation of which this podcast is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.509" end="00:09:21.769" style="s2">part of which your column for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.430" end="00:09:25.399" style="s2">stranger is clearly a part whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.769" end="00:09:27.350" style="s2">discussion is would have an Twp I</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.399" end="00:09:31.579" style="s2">believe had Donald Trump revealed</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.350" end="00:09:35.269" style="s2">himself to be a visionary maverick who</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.579" end="00:09:37.069" style="s2">was not of the system that had held us</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.269" end="00:09:39.709" style="s2">hostage there would have been a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.069" end="00:09:41.630" style="s2">us who would have defended him that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.709" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">not what emerged obviously I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.630" end="00:09:47.060" style="s2">really think the person has it in him</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s not out of personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.060" end="00:09:50.810" style="s2">hatred that I feel like we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:51.620" style="s2">him out of office it&#39;s just this is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.810" end="00:09:53.899" style="s2">safe right</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.620" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">migrant although I do also really</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.899" end="00:09:57.110" style="s2"> hate him I&#39;d hate him and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:59.569" style="s2">would like totally admit that but I also</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.110" end="00:10:01.310" style="s2">think that again that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.569" end="00:10:03.560" style="s2">problem like I work in the media I have</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.310" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">I&#39;m very transparent about about my</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.560" end="00:10:07.339" style="s2">feelings about Donald Trump but people</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:09.649" style="s2">like me are all over the media ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.339" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">and when he talks about fake news I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.649" end="00:10:13.069" style="s2">he took the term fake news he took this</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">very real thing and he distorted the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.069" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">term he rebranded it and made it any</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:19.370" style="s2">criticism of him yeah the truth is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:21.649" style="s2">media is biased against Donald Trump I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.370" end="00:10:26.649" style="s2">mean no question about absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.649" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">well so personally just the way I tick I</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.649" end="00:10:34.689" style="s2">hate very few people right I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:36.949" style="s2">strong negative reaction to the Clintons</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.689" end="00:10:38.420" style="s2">but I wouldn&#39;t even call it hate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.949" end="00:10:41.180" style="s2">just like wait a second that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.420" end="00:10:43.130" style="s2">influence-peddling that that&#39;s corrosive</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.180" end="00:10:47.230" style="s2">to the very things that the country</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.130" end="00:10:50.329" style="s2">needs to stand for and frankly I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.230" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">so in short I don&#39;t hate Donald Trump I</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.329" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s productive it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.569" style="s2">productive in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:58.699" style="s2">counterproductive but with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.569" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">the Clintons the reason that I maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.699" end="00:11:05.840" style="s2">even feel more strongly about them is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">that I my lifetime overlapped</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.840" end="00:11:13.640" style="s2">a transition in left-leaning politics</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:15.440" style="s2">and basically what I saw happened and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.640" end="00:11:17.210" style="s2">know I&#39;ve got a lot of pushback for for</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:22.820" style="s2">this but what I saw happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.210" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">was a the Republican Party innovated a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.820" end="00:11:28.940" style="s2">kind of influence peddling and catering</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:30.650" style="s2">to a corporate entity that did not have</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.940" end="00:11:33.230" style="s2">our best interests at heart and it got</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.650" end="00:11:36.650" style="s2">very good at it and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.230" end="00:11:39.710" style="s2">challenging it the Democrats mimicked it</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.650" end="00:11:42.290" style="s2">and they became the alternative so now</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.710" end="00:11:45.830" style="s2">that we have two two flavors of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.290" end="00:11:50.090" style="s2">corporate rule and what got assured out</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.830" end="00:11:51.860" style="s2">was the historical obligation that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.090" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">Democratic Party had to working people</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.860" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">to common people well if no party</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">represents common people you end up</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">where we are now and so the I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">problem that I have with the Clintons is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:09.740" style="s2">that they represent the Democratic Party</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:12.260" style="s2">turning its back on working people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.740" end="00:12:14.030" style="s2">now the Democratic Party is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.260" end="00:12:16.670" style="s2">making the argument every single</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.030" end="00:12:18.590" style="s2">election well who you gonna vote for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.670" end="00:12:19.820" style="s2">Republicans you&#39;re gonna let them win</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.590" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">are you gonna vote for a third party</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.820" end="00:12:22.910" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna hand this to the Republican</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:24.830" style="s2">that it&#39;s like look how many elections</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.910" end="00:12:26.630" style="s2">do you get to threaten me with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.830" end="00:12:29.060" style="s2">Republicans winning before this is your</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.630" end="00:12:30.440" style="s2">fault rather than mine right you decided</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.060" end="00:12:31.670" style="s2">to make that bargain and want to become</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.440" end="00:12:33.050" style="s2">popular there&#39;s a very easy</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.670" end="00:12:34.640" style="s2">straightforward way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.050" end="00:12:36.140" style="s2">start representing common Pete right</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.640" end="00:12:39.380" style="s2">right yeah no I think you&#39;re right about</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.140" end="00:12:41.270" style="s2">that I think that there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.380" end="00:12:43.070" style="s2">forces to blame for Donald Trump winning</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.270" end="00:12:45.410" style="s2">the election but I think the first one</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.070" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">should be the DNC in the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.410" end="00:12:48.410" style="s2">Party and Hillary Clinton was a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:50.660" style="s2">candidate I was I was one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.410" end="00:12:54.770" style="s2">people who thought that she was going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.660" end="00:12:56.840" style="s2">lose because I&#39;m from North Carolina I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.770" end="00:12:58.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.840" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">conservative people but I sort of know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.760" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">enough to know how people feel about</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:03.860" style="s2">Hillary Clinton my girlfriend&#39;s parents</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:05.780" style="s2">are Alaska and they hate they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.860" end="00:13:07.910" style="s2">Christian they hated Donald Trump they</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.780" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">still voted for him because they called</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.910" end="00:13:12.590" style="s2">her a snake in the grass they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:14.930" style="s2">willing to vote for a man who has the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.590" end="00:13:16.370" style="s2">race like his values are actually less</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.930" end="00:13:18.050" style="s2">in line with theirs than hers are in</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.370" end="00:13:19.120" style="s2">some ways yeah but they were willing to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.050" end="00:13:20.740" style="s2">vote for him</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.120" end="00:13:22.059" style="s2">they hated Hillary Clinton so much and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.740" end="00:13:23.259" style="s2">when I heard that to me it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.059" end="00:13:25.990" style="s2">this is what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.259" end="00:13:27.399" style="s2">people hate her and she granted she won</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.990" end="00:13:29.139" style="s2">the popular vote but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.399" end="00:13:32.019" style="s2">it absolute is my and just the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.139" end="00:13:35.559" style="s2">like so the first election I voted in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.019" end="00:13:37.420" style="s2">was Al Gore we know what happened there</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.559" end="00:13:39.370" style="s2">Hillary Clinton we know what happened</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.420" end="00:13:43.059" style="s2">there I just cannot see if the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.370" end="00:13:44.860" style="s2">Republicans continue to lose the popular</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.059" end="00:13:46.779" style="s2">or lose the election after winning the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.860" end="00:13:48.279" style="s2">popular vote I think that this system</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.779" end="00:13:50.680" style="s2">would have changed by now but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.279" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">Democrats are so ineffective that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.680" end="00:13:59.709" style="s2">system continues to exist yeah well so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:01.089" style="s2">have been toying with something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.709" end="00:14:04.269" style="s2">know how to deploy it or what it even</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.089" end="00:14:05.499" style="s2">becomes but you know when you at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.269" end="00:14:10.120" style="s2">beginning of this discussion we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.499" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">talking about the left and the Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.120" end="00:14:14.249" style="s2">catering to them I don&#39;t even see it as</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">the left I see it as people who have</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.249" end="00:14:18.519" style="s2">co-opted the left who are being catered</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">to who don&#39;t even really know what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.519" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">want an extent that this is so well</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:26.920" style="s2">intentioned it&#39;s it&#39;s a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:30.730" style="s2">of what left actually is and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.920" end="00:14:31.449" style="s2">want to do is found what I call your</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.730" end="00:14:33.939" style="s2">other left</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.449" end="00:14:35.559" style="s2">right not that left your other left</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.939" end="00:14:37.029" style="s2">right what is your other left well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.559" end="00:14:39.339" style="s2">founded on</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.029" end="00:14:40.870" style="s2">yes classical liberal principles but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.339" end="00:14:43.689" style="s2">think it goes you know classical liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.870" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">has become a kind of a shield for people</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.689" end="00:14:47.860" style="s2">who are right-of-center</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:50.410" style="s2">right but have some some classically</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.860" end="00:14:52.629" style="s2">liberal values and what I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.410" end="00:14:56.620" style="s2">do is make a distinction which is we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.629" end="00:14:58.360" style="s2">actually do need progress we cannot stay</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.620" end="00:15:01.179" style="s2">on this trajectory as much as we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.360" end="00:15:04.360" style="s2">being very well served in the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.179" end="00:15:06.939" style="s2">present a not all of us are being really</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.360" end="00:15:08.829" style="s2">well served and be it&#39;s not stable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.939" end="00:15:11.230" style="s2">dangerous long-term it will come apart</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.829" end="00:15:13.929" style="s2">and it will be a disaster so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.230" end="00:15:18.129" style="s2">have progress and what I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.929" end="00:15:20.860" style="s2">see is a very sober discussion of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.129" end="00:15:23.259" style="s2">one moves forward without making the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.860" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">classic errors that people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.259" end="00:15:26.410" style="s2">tend to make where they see an</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:28.089" style="s2">opportunity to make things better and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.410" end="00:15:30.670" style="s2">they don&#39;t understand that they also are</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.089" end="00:15:32.190" style="s2">in danger of making things worse we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.670" end="00:15:36.570" style="s2">to have that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.190" end="00:15:39.870" style="s2">and anyway I&#39;m this is a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">era to be in but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.870" end="00:15:45.840" style="s2">that&#39;s very positive about it is that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:47.700" style="s2">is causing people to emerge into public</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.840" end="00:15:49.470" style="s2">consciousness who I think under ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.700" end="00:15:51.750" style="s2">circumstances would never be heard from</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.470" end="00:15:54.120" style="s2">people who are very creative and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.750" end="00:15:57.240" style="s2">and I&#39;m thinking of you actually in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.120" end="00:15:59.790" style="s2">context very specifically that you you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.240" end="00:16:01.320" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know how many of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.790" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">listeners will be familiar with you a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.320" end="00:16:07.020" style="s2">lot of them but not all of them yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:11.130" style="s2">you have done a great job of being true</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.020" end="00:16:14.310" style="s2">to your liberal beliefs and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.130" end="00:16:16.980" style="s2">you&#39;re like me quite far left while</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.310" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">being honest about what we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.980" end="00:16:22.350" style="s2">straight over on the left and I think my</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:26.430" style="s2">favorite thing about what you&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.350" end="00:16:28.950" style="s2">is the way you were wielding humor in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.430" end="00:16:31.290" style="s2">order to be able to save very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.950" end="00:16:32.910" style="s2">uncomfortable things thank you I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.290" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">it&#39;s wonderful thank you I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.910" end="00:16:42.900" style="s2">that but it&#39;s also you know AI think</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:44.820" style="s2">this is actually probably an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.900" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">mode I mean in other words that we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.820" end="00:16:48.690" style="s2">a mistress an adaptation yeah what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:50.820" style="s2">humour right it&#39;s not some frivolous</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.690" end="00:16:54.540" style="s2">thing to entertain you right right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:16:58.470" style="s2">way too deep for that and the the way it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.540" end="00:17:02.100" style="s2">functions is way too complex for that to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.470" end="00:17:04.110" style="s2">be the explanation so in part one it has</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.100" end="00:17:06.150" style="s2">to be about is navigating stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.110" end="00:17:08.819" style="s2">can&#39;t come out directly write and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.150" end="00:17:11.250" style="s2">causing people to have that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.819" end="00:17:13.230" style="s2">whiplash they get at the moment in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:15.660" style="s2">joke where they suddenly have the real</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.230" end="00:17:16.829" style="s2">meaning revealed if they get the joke if</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.660" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">they get the joke right</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.829" end="00:17:21.420" style="s2">well but even even the line between</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">those who do and don&#39;t get the joke</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.420" end="00:17:26.819" style="s2">carries so much yeah meaning I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:28.470" style="s2">horrifying is it to be in a room of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.819" end="00:17:29.490" style="s2">people when the joke is deployed and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.470" end="00:17:31.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know why everybody is laughing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.490" end="00:17:33.660" style="s2">right right or you laugh when nobody</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.980" end="00:17:36.360" style="s2">else does I mean those are that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.660" end="00:17:36.690" style="s2">disaster so yeah totally yeah for a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.360" end="00:17:39.630" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.690" end="00:17:41.700" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting hypothesis I</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.630" end="00:17:43.320" style="s2">had never thought of humor as an Evelyn</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.700" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">as an evolutionary adaptation but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.320" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">suppose everything is you know in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:47.460" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:51.000" style="s2">especially well what I would say and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.460" end="00:17:54.240" style="s2">know I&#39;ve deployed a little test for is</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.000" end="00:17:56.490" style="s2">it it is the presumption that something</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.240" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">is an adaptation yeah and basically if</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.490" end="00:18:01.470" style="s2">you have something that is complex that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:03.899" style="s2">persists over evolutionary time and has</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.470" end="00:18:05.519" style="s2">a cost that could be reduced then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.899" end="00:18:07.049" style="s2">know it must be paying at least that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.519" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">cost and then some or it wouldn&#39;t stick</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.049" end="00:18:16.710" style="s2">around so to me things like humor</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">consciousness religion music all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.710" end="00:18:20.519" style="s2">these things are slam dunks their</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.600" end="00:18:22.230" style="s2">adaptations that&#39;s not the hard question</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.519" end="00:18:24.330" style="s2">mhm what could they possibly before</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.230" end="00:18:25.980" style="s2">right that&#39;s a good question getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.330" end="00:18:28.169" style="s2">late isn&#39;t that the isn&#39;t that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.980" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2">answer that almost goes without saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.169" end="00:18:30.509" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:32.730" style="s2">although I&#39;m a LESBIAN so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.509" end="00:18:34.980" style="s2">how this that help humor deploy my humor</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.730" end="00:18:36.659" style="s2">to uh to bed people who can never bear</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.980" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">my bear my children is really gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.659" end="00:18:41.639" style="s2">me humans are weird</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">well human humans are so my advisor is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.639" end="00:18:45.629" style="s2">guy named dick Alexander who was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:50.009" style="s2">wonderful guy very funny</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.629" end="00:18:53.399" style="s2">um he was he was very polarizing he was</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.009" end="00:18:56.039" style="s2">well loved by people who liked him and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.399" end="00:18:58.759" style="s2">in my department he was despised by</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.039" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">people who had challenged him and lost</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.759" end="00:19:04.039" style="s2">but anyway he Oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.929" end="00:19:12.059" style="s2">sexuality uh no you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.200" end="00:19:14.639" style="s2">fact that you were deploying humor</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.059" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">people who couldn&#39;t possibly write um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.639" end="00:19:24.120" style="s2">did you say barrier did yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:29.419" style="s2">good one so anyway dick wrote a paper a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.120" end="00:19:31.649" style="s2">great one that was titled on the human</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.419" end="00:19:33.240" style="s2">humans as the uniquely unique species</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.649" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not the exact title but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.240" end="00:19:38.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a great paper and the basic point</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">was that you know all species are unique</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.159" end="00:19:44.730" style="s2">but humans are uniquely unique so when</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:46.350" style="s2">you say that humans are weird you ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.730" end="00:19:48.090" style="s2">kiddin yeah we&#39;re the we are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.350" end="00:19:50.490" style="s2">species there is yeah there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.090" end="00:19:52.259" style="s2">I want to ask you about yeah so all</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.490" end="00:19:54.360" style="s2">right so there&#39;s this replication crisis</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.259" end="00:19:56.429" style="s2">and specifically in like social science</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.360" end="00:19:58.330" style="s2">right yeah and all of these studies that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.429" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">have been cited thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:03.220" style="s2">and are taken is sort of you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">believes to be true or it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.220" end="00:20:06.580" style="s2">they&#39;re either not replicable or the or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:08.800" style="s2">the study was in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.580" end="00:20:09.910" style="s2">yeah so the the latest one to come out</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.800" end="00:20:11.620" style="s2">and sort of make a big splash</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.910" end="00:20:13.420" style="s2">christina hoff sommers wrote a piece in</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.620" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">The Wall Street Journal about the blind</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.420" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">Orchestra study yep did you see this</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:18.580" style="s2">maybe you can explain the study a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:21.340" style="s2">bit better</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.580" end="00:20:26.350" style="s2">well the blind Orchestra study basically</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.340" end="00:20:28.590" style="s2">said that the number of women who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.350" end="00:20:33.040" style="s2">hired into important positions in</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.590" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">orchestras went up dramatically when the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.040" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">auditions were held behind a screen that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:38.500" style="s2">masked their gender right and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">out that this was not actually true</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.500" end="00:20:42.940" style="s2">right so anyway you were gonna make more</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:46.540" style="s2">just knowing about the replication</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.940" end="00:20:47.680" style="s2">crisis okay so everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.540" end="00:20:49.540" style="s2">happened in the past couple years</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.680" end="00:20:52.180" style="s2">politically everything that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.540" end="00:20:55.930" style="s2">through my own sort of personal to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.180" end="00:20:57.160" style="s2">to the downsides of the laughs watching</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.930" end="00:20:59.800" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with these replication</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.160" end="00:21:03.340" style="s2">crises things like this my son with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.800" end="00:21:05.350" style="s2">b2 movement my sense of what is real and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.340" end="00:21:08.620" style="s2">what is not real has become much</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.350" end="00:21:10.420" style="s2">blurrier and and one there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.620" end="00:21:12.970" style="s2">particular Avenue where I find this the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.420" end="00:21:16.470" style="s2">most concerning and it&#39;s climate change</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.970" end="00:21:18.280" style="s2">yeah because what I realized is that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.470" end="00:21:20.110" style="s2">realized that I&#39;m not a climate</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.280" end="00:21:22.090" style="s2">scientist you know I don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.110" end="00:21:23.290" style="s2">I can look at the data and I wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.090" end="00:21:25.060" style="s2">able to tell you what it says and be</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.290" end="00:21:26.710" style="s2">like reading Esperanto I actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.060" end="00:21:29.700" style="s2">probably read Esperanto better than I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.710" end="00:21:32.950" style="s2">could study on snow pack or whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.700" end="00:21:35.140" style="s2">can trust scientists I I do trust</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.950" end="00:21:37.630" style="s2">scientists I trust the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.140" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">and I think the right method is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.630" end="00:21:40.030" style="s2">4-story</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.320" end="00:21:42.610" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.030" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">climate science and social science for</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.610" end="00:21:45.640" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:48.010" style="s2">but I still find myself saying like if</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.640" end="00:21:50.620" style="s2">everything else that I thought was true</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.010" end="00:21:52.510" style="s2">wasn&#39;t true what if this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.620" end="00:21:54.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t true and it&#39;s really with</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.510" end="00:21:56.380" style="s2">me I mean I wrote I covered client I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.190" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">an environmental reporter for years I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.380" end="00:22:02.980" style="s2">believe in climate change but I also</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:04.510" style="s2">don&#39;t believe I don&#39;t trust activists I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.980" end="00:22:06.130" style="s2">no longer trust activists and I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.510" end="00:22:07.360" style="s2">that most of the information when I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.130" end="00:22:08.830" style="s2">a climate reporter most of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.360" end="00:22:10.510" style="s2">information I was getting was filtered</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.830" end="00:22:11.650" style="s2">through activists you get press releases</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.510" end="00:22:13.179" style="s2">from activists</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.650" end="00:22:15.370" style="s2">everything&#39;s filtered through this sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.179" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">of political lens and I don&#39;t trust it</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.370" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">anymore I don&#39;t trust the apparatus I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:21.220" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the methodology and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:22.659" style="s2">trust any of it but I still believe in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.220" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">climate change so I&#39;m just having this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.659" end="00:22:27.669" style="s2">like this sort of difficulty here like</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:29.320" style="s2">what if that is also not true so this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.669" end="00:22:32.110" style="s2">the real red pill yeah forget that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.320" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">conservative this is real one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.110" end="00:22:38.890" style="s2">we&#39;re about to mainline it yeah well but</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:42.850" style="s2">you know I guess look at on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.890" end="00:22:45.460" style="s2">I actually viscerally feel your pain I</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.850" end="00:22:47.620" style="s2">know exactly the revolution that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.460" end="00:22:51.159" style="s2">experiencing and boy is it frightening</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.620" end="00:22:54.010" style="s2">yes on the other hand it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.159" end="00:22:56.830" style="s2">marvelous that you&#39;re there right</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.010" end="00:22:59.950" style="s2">because the tiny number of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.830" end="00:23:04.419" style="s2">other side of that thing need you right</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.950" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">so look you&#39;ve pushed play on something</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.419" end="00:23:08.649" style="s2">that has a lot of threads</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:11.080" style="s2">let&#39;s explore them and then we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.649" end="00:23:13.539" style="s2">where we end up mm-hmm eh this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.080" end="00:23:15.880" style="s2">replication crisis has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.539" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">with social science right no I&#39;m ok with</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.880" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">it right what it has to do with is a an</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:29.380" style="s2">opportunity and niche that exists inside</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:31.330" style="s2">of academic science right social science</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.380" end="00:23:33.340" style="s2">is maybe the most vulnerable to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.330" end="00:23:37.029" style="s2">because the other things that compete</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.340" end="00:23:39.190" style="s2">with this niche are less strong mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.029" end="00:23:41.649" style="s2">all right so because social science is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.190" end="00:23:44.620" style="s2">little bit iffy to begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.649" end="00:23:46.260" style="s2">replication problem pulls harder right</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.620" end="00:23:50.169" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a countervailing force</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.260" end="00:23:52.899" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna find this everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.169" end="00:23:55.179" style="s2">that P values have been utilized and P</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.899" end="00:23:57.580" style="s2">values have been utilized across science</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.179" end="00:23:59.470" style="s2">and I should say I will pat myself on</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.580" end="00:24:01.929" style="s2">the back for this one I was shouting</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.470" end="00:24:05.620" style="s2">about this long before replication</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.929" end="00:24:08.529" style="s2">crisis had ever arisen as a term right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.620" end="00:24:10.419" style="s2">the problem with p-values is that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.529" end="00:24:13.659" style="s2">don&#39;t say nearly as much as you would</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.419" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">like them to say and so effectively what</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.659" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">they say is we have a pattern that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:23.230" style="s2">seen it has a strength</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:24.860" style="s2">and that strength needs to be above the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.230" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">level where we would expect</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.860" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">to see it by accidental random sampling</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:33.890" style="s2">error and so what we want is a situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:36.289" style="s2">in which 19 out of 20 times you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.890" end="00:24:39.380" style="s2">get a pattern that strong by random</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.289" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">sampling error alright but 1 out of 20</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.380" end="00:24:47.419" style="s2">you do now the problem is if I run a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:50.269" style="s2">bunch of studies and they don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.419" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2">significant p-value and then I run</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.269" end="00:24:55.460" style="s2">another study that&#39;s no better and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.460" end="00:24:57.799" style="s2">does and I published that one right if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.460" end="00:24:59.570" style="s2">don&#39;t you know published a negative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.799" end="00:25:01.519" style="s2">right the point of the p-value actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.570" end="00:25:03.409" style="s2">means nothing right worse than meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.519" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">nothing what it does is it pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.409" end="00:25:09.130" style="s2">quantifies our level of certainty which</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:13.519" style="s2">we have no basis for so this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.130" end="00:25:16.460" style="s2">a vulnerability from the beginning yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.519" end="00:25:18.620" style="s2">and what it means is we have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.460" end="00:25:20.510" style="s2">that things that are based on p-values</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.620" end="00:25:22.490" style="s2">unless you have information about</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.510" end="00:25:24.169" style="s2">everything all of the work that was done</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.490" end="00:25:27.980" style="s2">you don&#39;t know how to evaluate them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.169" end="00:25:29.539" style="s2">then worse is even if you did have all</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:31.309" style="s2">of the data of all of the studies that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.539" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">were run and didn&#39;t come to anything and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.309" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2">never got published you wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:36.049" style="s2">which ones of them were done well mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:37.519" style="s2">so some of them may not have been</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.049" end="00:25:38.870" style="s2">published because the people who did the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.519" end="00:25:40.909" style="s2">experiments felt like you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.870" end="00:25:42.049" style="s2">quite right I think there was a flaw in</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.909" end="00:25:43.639" style="s2">the way the data was collected</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.049" end="00:25:45.500" style="s2">so they jettisoned those for good</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.639" end="00:25:46.789" style="s2">reasons that&#39;s not real data but then</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.500" end="00:25:49.250" style="s2">the other ones are real data so we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.789" end="00:25:51.559" style="s2">no no basis to calibrate right our</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.250" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">journals less likely to publish a study</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.559" end="00:25:55.820" style="s2">that has no sort of finding and of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:58.010" style="s2">course yeah of course because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.820" end="00:25:59.510" style="s2">journals are in an economic competition</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.010" end="00:26:03.169" style="s2">that is nowhere in the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.510" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">right okay so this is God so basically</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.169" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">the work that find that the work that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:08.899" style="s2">would establish some baseline is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:09.980" style="s2">being published and the only the only</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.899" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re seeing is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.980" end="00:26:17.750" style="s2">impressive values you&#39;re seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:19.909" style="s2">sampling error of samples right right</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.750" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">seeing those samples that said X and not</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.909" end="00:26:27.289" style="s2">those that said well this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:31.720" style="s2">in the middle you where the job</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.289" end="00:26:33.860" style="s2">prospects are artificially bleak in</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.720" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">science and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.860" end="00:26:37.880" style="s2">obscure all right the reason that job</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:38.659" style="s2">prospects are bad if you get your PhD</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.880" end="00:26:40.129" style="s2">you probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.659" end="00:26:42.590" style="s2">we won&#39;t get a professorship the reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.129" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">for that is that the universities are</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.590" end="00:26:48.379" style="s2">involved in a kind of con where they are</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.479" style="s2">trying to get their classes taught on</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.379" end="00:26:52.729" style="s2">the cheap so that they can free the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.479" end="00:26:54.109" style="s2">professor&#39;s to get grant right now the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.729" end="00:26:56.299" style="s2">reason that they want to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.109" end="00:27:00.470" style="s2">because half of the grant money or more</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.299" end="00:27:02.749" style="s2">goes to the university so that makes a</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.470" end="00:27:04.820" style="s2">priority of free any professors from</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.749" end="00:27:06.619" style="s2">teaching how do you free professors from</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.820" end="00:27:08.840" style="s2">teaching I think a lot of graduate</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.619" end="00:27:10.820" style="s2">graduate students right side you get a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.840" end="00:27:12.169" style="s2">lot of graduate students you make more</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.820" end="00:27:13.999" style="s2">graduate students than there are jobs</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.169" end="00:27:16.220" style="s2">which then puts them in more intense</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.999" end="00:27:18.049" style="s2">competition when they graduate which</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.220" end="00:27:20.450" style="s2">then results in them being much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.049" end="00:27:23.359" style="s2">compromised ethically because they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.450" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">say the true thing when the popular</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.359" end="00:27:27.619" style="s2">thing is what&#39;s going to get you the job</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:30.440" style="s2">so is this going to be in effect in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.619" end="00:27:31.340" style="s2">climate science unfortunately it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.440" end="00:27:33.409" style="s2">help it right</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.340" end="00:27:34.970" style="s2">right right if you are going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.409" end="00:27:37.220" style="s2">get a job in climate science and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.970" end="00:27:39.529" style="s2">gonna publish something that says wait a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.220" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">minute maybe things aren&#39;t as bad as we</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.529" end="00:27:48.229" style="s2">think you&#39;re gonna get crushed and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:50.690" style="s2">the terrible fact here is that if</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.229" end="00:27:53.450" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing we can be sure of its</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.690" end="00:27:55.580" style="s2">that climate science as a social</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.450" end="00:27:57.169" style="s2">endeavor is polluted by the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.580" end="00:28:00.009" style="s2">perverse incentives that have polluted</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.169" end="00:28:01.940" style="s2">social science and that that has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.009" end="00:28:03.259" style="s2">blinding effect so we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.940" end="00:28:05.570" style="s2">what we&#39;re looking at right I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.259" end="00:28:07.580" style="s2">makes total sense right this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.570" end="00:28:09.470" style="s2">like that the world&#39;s gonna end in 12</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.580" end="00:28:11.090" style="s2">years I sort of like to like to freak</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.470" end="00:28:13.129" style="s2">people out cuz it&#39;s a little bit fun but</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.090" end="00:28:15.109" style="s2">the reality is like there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.129" end="00:28:17.539" style="s2">consequences to this you know like there</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.109" end="00:28:18.950" style="s2">are kids in middle schools I&#39;m told that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.539" end="00:28:21.379" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna get to grow up to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:23.090" style="s2">adults because because my parents</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.379" end="00:28:25.570" style="s2">generation screwed them over or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.090" end="00:28:27.440" style="s2">Exxon did it or whatever I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.570" end="00:28:30.049" style="s2">psychologically what is this doing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.440" end="00:28:31.820" style="s2">people well but like we haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.049" end="00:28:34.070" style="s2">begun to go down the rabbit oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.820" end="00:28:35.659" style="s2">because here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.070" end="00:28:38.269" style="s2">necessarily wrong that the world&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.659" end="00:28:42.349" style="s2">end in 12 years it&#39;s not gonna end in 12</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.269" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">years if we extrapolate linearly or even</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.349" end="00:28:47.389" style="s2">exponentially from where we are but</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:50.179" style="s2">there is a pathway there that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.389" end="00:28:51.789" style="s2">direct which has to do with frozen</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.179" end="00:28:54.039" style="s2">methane in the Arctic</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.789" end="00:28:55.989" style="s2">of which there is a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.039" end="00:28:57.609" style="s2">and it needs to stay that way it needs</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.989" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">to stay frozen yeah right and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.609" end="00:29:01.989" style="s2">problem is that there is likely a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.710" end="00:29:04.570" style="s2">threshold that we will cross where the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.989" end="00:29:06.639" style="s2">release of methane from the arctic well</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:08.200" style="s2">so dwarf our contribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.639" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">atmosphere from burning fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.200" end="00:29:14.409" style="s2">that this process will run away that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:16.419" style="s2">could happen this afternoon mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.409" end="00:29:18.549" style="s2">there&#39;s reason to think we might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.419" end="00:29:20.649" style="s2">close to that threshold which is this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.549" end="00:29:22.299" style="s2">the other side of the coin do we know</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.649" end="00:29:26.979" style="s2">that the models that are being published</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.299" end="00:29:28.690" style="s2">in climate science are reliable no we</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.979" end="00:29:31.210" style="s2">can be pretty sure that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.690" end="00:29:34.269" style="s2">garbage there now it&#39;s possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.210" end="00:29:35.950" style="s2">noise is dwarfed by the signal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.269" end="00:29:37.960" style="s2">possible that the models are good</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.950" end="00:29:40.599" style="s2">they&#39;re just not nearly as good as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.960" end="00:29:43.629" style="s2">claimed but it&#39;s also possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.599" end="00:29:46.570" style="s2">models are really scarred and I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.629" end="00:29:51.460" style="s2">say one thing that is important to</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.570" end="00:29:54.330" style="s2">understand is that there is a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.460" end="00:29:56.830" style="s2">constantly frustrated by the absence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.330" end="00:29:59.169" style="s2">philosophers of science in our science</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.830" end="00:30:01.749" style="s2">debates because there in some ways we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.169" end="00:30:04.029" style="s2">we&#39;ve paid to train them to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.749" end="00:30:06.429" style="s2">some issues that are very important but</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.029" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">almost none of us understand one of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.429" end="00:30:12.220" style="s2">in this case would be those models are</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.580" end="00:30:14.499" style="s2">not actually good for testing anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.220" end="00:30:15.909" style="s2">mm-hmm the system is too complex we</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.499" end="00:30:17.889" style="s2">don&#39;t know enough about it to use them</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.909" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">as a test of what&#39;s going to happen but</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.889" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">we can use them to generate predictions</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:25.599" style="s2">of what might happen which then can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:28.239" style="s2">tested in the world itself so if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.599" end="00:30:30.820" style="s2">could navigate that that boundary</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.239" end="00:30:32.169" style="s2">carefully we could use the models and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.820" end="00:30:34.679" style="s2">can find out how good they are but if</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.169" end="00:30:40.929" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna use them to test ideas then</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.679" end="00:30:44.139" style="s2">it becomes a delusion mm-hmm so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.929" end="00:30:48.129" style="s2">question is if the models are suspect</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.139" end="00:30:51.369" style="s2">which they have to be what do we do do</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.129" end="00:30:52.570" style="s2">we say well this is you know all a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.369" end="00:30:54.220" style="s2">of people right it&#39;s an aquiline</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.570" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">conspiracy it&#39;s a left-wing conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.220" end="00:30:58.840" style="s2">this that and the other I don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">I&#39;m sure not where I come out yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.840" end="00:31:03.159" style="s2">come out is first of all there are other</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:04.549" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t model-based that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.159" end="00:31:08.839" style="s2">ought to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.549" end="00:31:10.669" style="s2">alarm us mhm the retreat of glaciers for</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.839" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">example that&#39;s something you can see</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.669" end="00:31:16.580" style="s2">with your own eyes it does not require a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:19.129" style="s2">model even more frightening I would say</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.580" end="00:31:24.229" style="s2">is the discovery on the Yamal Peninsula</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.129" end="00:31:26.119" style="s2">and Siberia of these new craters you</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.229" end="00:31:27.889" style="s2">know about them no I don&#39;t know why the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.119" end="00:31:31.070" style="s2">images of these things are not among the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.889" end="00:31:33.799" style="s2">most famous images on earth but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.070" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">story is that some petroleum workers</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.799" end="00:31:40.579" style="s2">were flying over this Peninsula of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:45.469" style="s2">tundra Peninsula in in Siberia and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.579" end="00:31:47.329" style="s2">spotted a giant crater that was new and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.469" end="00:31:49.999" style="s2">then they found another one and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.329" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">question is well what process did that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.999" end="00:31:54.259" style="s2">we don&#39;t even have a name for what</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:55.700" style="s2">process did that did you know meteor of</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.259" end="00:32:00.429" style="s2">hit it or what right</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.700" end="00:32:03.349" style="s2">the hypothesis emerged that these were</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.429" end="00:32:05.899" style="s2">explosive releases of methane that had</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.349" end="00:32:11.089" style="s2">ejected a vast amount of rock from these</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.899" end="00:32:13.219" style="s2">giants holes in the ground and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.089" end="00:32:15.169" style="s2">would of course be alarming because what</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.219" end="00:32:17.659" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about is the explosive</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.169" end="00:32:19.369" style="s2">release of methane and so we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.659" end="00:32:21.469" style="s2">things in the ocean where we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.369" end="00:32:23.359" style="s2">plumes of methane bubble up that appear</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.469" end="00:32:24.709" style="s2">to be unprecedented we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.359" end="00:32:27.139" style="s2">what they mean because nobody took</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.709" end="00:32:30.019" style="s2">baseline data 50 years ago so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.139" end="00:32:31.339" style="s2">know if blooms of methane bubbling up</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.019" end="00:32:33.529" style="s2">should alarm us or shouldn&#39;t but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.339" end="00:32:38.209" style="s2">certainly is consistent with our alarm</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.529" end="00:32:40.249" style="s2">but these these craters on land the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.209" end="00:32:41.809" style="s2">prediction was well if these are methane</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.249" end="00:32:43.309" style="s2">release craters than methane ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.809" end="00:32:45.799" style="s2">highly concentrated in the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.309" end="00:32:48.889" style="s2">these things and you know people went in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.799" end="00:32:52.339" style="s2">and there was super high concentrations</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.889" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">of methane so you could make an argument</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.339" end="00:32:56.419" style="s2">one way or the other but my basic point</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:58.219" style="s2">would be look the links in the chain</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.419" end="00:33:00.200" style="s2">that tell us to worry about climate are</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.219" end="00:33:01.639" style="s2">actually more secure than people think</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.200" end="00:33:02.719" style="s2">they have nothing to do with models they</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.639" end="00:33:05.589" style="s2">have to do with some very simple</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.719" end="00:33:08.359" style="s2">chemistry that tells us that things like</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.589" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">carbon dioxide and methane trap heat</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.359" end="00:33:13.219" style="s2">right um which is you know that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:14.839" style="s2">long-standing grandfather says</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.219" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">well-established easy to demonstrate in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.839" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">the lab and then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:22.610" style="s2">that glacial retreat and things like</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:25.010" style="s2">that and then we&#39;ve got novel geology</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.610" end="00:33:27.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve got you know rock being ejected by</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.010" end="00:33:30.800" style="s2">explosive releases of methane which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.080" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">consistent with sudden releases of large</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.800" end="00:33:36.190" style="s2">amounts of this stuff that are frozen in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:39.910" style="s2">the Arctic all of that stuff tells me</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.190" end="00:33:42.800" style="s2">you had best worry yeah and what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.910" end="00:33:44.270" style="s2">the threshold at which this is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.800" end="00:33:47.060" style="s2">a problem that humans could plausibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.270" end="00:33:48.800" style="s2">deal with it could be anywhere right we</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.060" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">could cross it today right also could</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.800" end="00:33:52.970" style="s2">have crossed it could have crossed it oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:55.340" style="s2">yeah right yeah fifty years agos</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.970" end="00:33:57.290" style="s2">unlikely we have seen spectacular rises</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.340" end="00:34:02.330" style="s2">in temperature of a kind we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.290" end="00:34:04.730" style="s2">seen but in any case here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.330" end="00:34:07.820" style="s2">overarching place that I think those of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.730" end="00:34:11.960" style="s2">us on your other left on a autoland</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.820" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">mm-hmm the climate crisis is not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.960" end="00:34:16.580" style="s2">problem in and of itself it is a symptom</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">of another problem that doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.580" end="00:34:22.820" style="s2">name and my point would be we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:26.420" style="s2">solve the underlying problem we know</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.820" end="00:34:29.840" style="s2">that we have to solve it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.420" end="00:34:34.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like that cartoon you know what if</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.840" end="00:34:36.050" style="s2">we solve the world&#39;s problems to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.550" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">climate and it turns out it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.050" end="00:34:39.230" style="s2">hoax and we made it better for no reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:41.870" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.230" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s still better it&#39;s still better and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.870" end="00:34:46.550" style="s2">that serves everybody I don&#39;t care if</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.770" style="s2">you&#39;re a conservative or liberal I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.550" end="00:34:50.210" style="s2">want to see us crash an economy over it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.770" end="00:34:51.740" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what happened I</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.210" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">thank you would actually stimulate an</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.740" end="00:34:56.300" style="s2">economy for the same reason that a war</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">stimulates an economy a direction right</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.300" end="00:35:01.010" style="s2">industry a concerted effort to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">problem with an unofficial yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.010" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">underlying problem is one of chronic</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">unsustainable is where we are addicted</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:11.810" style="s2">to any process that makes a profit and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:13.910" style="s2">at the point we discover why it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.810" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">sustained it can&#39;t be reversed do you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:17.870" style="s2">think there&#39;s some evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:20.330" style="s2">explanation for this for instance our</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.870" end="00:35:22.580" style="s2">ancestors chimps you know off of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.330" end="00:35:25.190" style="s2">of a limb or whatever and don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.580" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">deal with with their own byproducts of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.190" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">their own pollution I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:31.060" style="s2">worse than that a little bit there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:32.920" style="s2">know and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.060" end="00:35:34.950" style="s2">difference a lack of understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.920" end="00:35:38.860" style="s2">the consequences of our behavior but</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.950" end="00:35:41.590" style="s2">worse than that we are the descendants</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.860" end="00:35:45.060" style="s2">of winners every single one of us right</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.590" end="00:35:47.790" style="s2">in fact every single one of us is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.060" end="00:35:49.990" style="s2">product of an unbroken line of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.790" end="00:35:52.270" style="s2">reproduction that stretches back three</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.990" end="00:35:54.580" style="s2">and a half billion years so as much as</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.270" end="00:35:56.950" style="s2">being a winner is a pretty rare thing we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.580" end="00:36:01.630" style="s2">heard that all the winnings Jo it&#39;s rare</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.950" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re at all of us right so what</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.630" end="00:36:06.450" style="s2">were our ancestors doing well one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">they were doing was they were not</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.450" end="00:36:12.990" style="s2">foregoing the use of resources that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">had acquired mm-hmm right there was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.990" end="00:36:19.150" style="s2">tendency to capture that which could be</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">captured and to turn it into something</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.150" end="00:36:25.840" style="s2">in motion and frankly that can be bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:28.180" style="s2">lots of populations have done themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.840" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">harm and in some cases gone extinct</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.180" end="00:36:32.980" style="s2">because they over exploited a resource</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:35.290" style="s2">but in general you know before</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.980" end="00:36:37.290" style="s2">industrialization it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.290" end="00:36:39.640" style="s2">dangerous right there was only so</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.290" end="00:36:42.070" style="s2">rapidly that people could you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.640" end="00:36:44.350" style="s2">DeForest the Amazon if they were using</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.070" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">hand tools right all right so a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.350" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">self-limiting now it ain&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:50.020" style="s2">I mean have you seen some of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:52.300" style="s2">videos of these machines yeah stripped</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.020" end="00:36:54.250" style="s2">trees yeah and that&#39;s another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.300" end="00:36:56.080" style="s2">like you know soy I live in western</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.250" end="00:36:57.940" style="s2">Washington you live in Oregon lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.080" end="00:37:00.100" style="s2">walking around here and there&#39;s this and</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.940" end="00:37:01.540" style="s2">I think there is more I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.100" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">speculating here but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.540" end="00:37:05.710" style="s2">logging has uptick since Trump came in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.480" style="s2">office and there&#39;s this idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.710" end="00:37:09.730" style="s2">know you can sort of sell it to people</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.480" end="00:37:11.530" style="s2">as a job provider it&#39;s not a job</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.730" end="00:37:13.540" style="s2">provider it&#39;s the one dude with a button</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.530" end="00:37:16.990" style="s2">yeah you know there&#39;s this is not you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.540" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">don&#39;t see it&#39;s eventually uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.990" end="00:37:20.290" style="s2">logging trucks will be automated too so</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:21.340" style="s2">there&#39;s not that&#39;s not going to provide</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.290" end="00:37:23.140" style="s2">to people with jobs you there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.340" end="00:37:24.370" style="s2">this sort of slash-and-burn it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.140" end="00:37:26.260" style="s2">incredibly depressing</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.370" end="00:37:27.700" style="s2">- just like drive around these you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.260" end="00:37:29.410" style="s2">sort of beautiful forests and see</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.700" end="00:37:30.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve all been decimated Oh see</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.410" end="00:37:33.190" style="s2">they&#39;ve all been decimated except that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.760" end="00:37:35.410" style="s2">they were decimated in a way there was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:39.130" style="s2">computer program as I understood it that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.410" end="00:37:40.900" style="s2">actually would predict what a particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.130" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">clear cut would look like from various</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.900" end="00:37:43.780" style="s2">places that it could be observed right</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:46.030" style="s2">so they have a screen</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.780" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">you know right so Orion has that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.030" end="00:37:49.570" style="s2">Washington doesn&#39;t have that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:50.470" style="s2">curtain as much so you can actually see</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.570" end="00:37:51.670" style="s2">it but like it yeah if you&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">from Portland out to the out to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.670" end="00:37:55.390" style="s2">Oregon coast they make sure that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">not you can only see the old-growth on</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.390" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">the side of the road ya know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:01.480" style="s2">blinders but they&#39;re on the road instead</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:04.090" style="s2">of on you&#39;re good yeah it&#39;s very sad</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.480" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve taken a I&#39;ve tried to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.090" end="00:38:08.280" style="s2">this sort of a really long view on</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:11.350" style="s2">climate and on on sustainability because</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.280" end="00:38:14.740" style="s2">humans are destroying the planet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.350" end="00:38:16.510" style="s2">undoubtedly clear but ultimately if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.740" end="00:38:18.580" style="s2">take the really long view it ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.510" end="00:38:20.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.580" end="00:38:23.230" style="s2">know thirty million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.440" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">Arizona was an ocean or I&#39;m making up</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.230" end="00:38:26.680" style="s2">the time if you if you stop caring about</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:30.010" style="s2">humanity so I try to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.680" end="00:38:33.340" style="s2">nihilistic about it eventually the earth</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.010" end="00:38:34.870" style="s2">will recover any different in different</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.340" end="00:38:36.850" style="s2">in different ways perhaps in mine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.870" end="00:38:39.070" style="s2">not gonna be the pristine globe that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.850" end="00:38:40.840" style="s2">once was you know when when humans</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.070" end="00:38:42.760" style="s2">disappear all it was a nuclear base will</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.840" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">melt down and this dance will need to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.760" end="00:38:45.580" style="s2">torn down and all of those things this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">is why I&#39;m a this is why I&#39;m in the</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">because I think if we took a couple</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.310" end="00:38:52.630" style="s2">generations torn down dams decommission</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:54.700" style="s2">nuclear power plants and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.630" end="00:38:56.950" style="s2">gradually fade it off you know we leave</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.700" end="00:38:59.920" style="s2">the planet for another species to rise</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.950" end="00:39:03.310" style="s2">and destroy and we&#39;ll just continue to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.920" end="00:39:05.260" style="s2">happen well please take whatever efforts</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.310" end="00:39:07.210" style="s2">that you will put into voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.260" end="00:39:12.070" style="s2">extinction very low effort very low</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.210" end="00:39:14.050" style="s2">effort that put them into stable dry</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.070" end="00:39:16.390" style="s2">cask storage for all of that nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.050" end="00:39:18.280" style="s2">waste yeah because that&#39;s a problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.390" end="00:39:20.770" style="s2">a real problem and people don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.280" end="00:39:24.760" style="s2">how significant it is but looks</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.770" end="00:39:26.770" style="s2">ultimately no one gets out alive right</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.760" end="00:39:30.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no escape freedom and even if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.770" end="00:39:33.820" style="s2">escaped the earth the galaxy is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.820" end="00:39:35.950" style="s2">crash into the neighboring galaxies even</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.820" end="00:39:37.720" style="s2">if we escape that disaster you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.950" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">escape the heat death of the universe so</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.720" end="00:39:43.480" style="s2">ultimately there&#39;s no point on the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:45.640" style="s2">hand you could say the same thing about</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.480" end="00:39:47.260" style="s2">your own life sure you are</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.640" end="00:39:49.240" style="s2">and yet here and yet here you are having</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.260" end="00:39:50.620" style="s2">a conversation I bet you&#39;re even going</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.240" end="00:39:52.210" style="s2">to take your next breath even though it</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.620" end="00:39:54.010" style="s2">will take my no there&#39;s no philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:55.060" style="s2">justification for it I will take my next</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.010" end="00:39:57.340" style="s2">breath but I will not have children</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.060" end="00:39:57.640" style="s2">although it&#39;s so not well guess I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.340" end="00:39:59.529" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.640" end="00:40:00.819" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s surreal so that&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.529" end="00:40:02.380" style="s2">answers that they don&#39;t want them but I</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.819" end="00:40:04.420" style="s2">can sort of I can sort of pose it as</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.380" end="00:40:06.700" style="s2">this heroic like you know I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.420" end="00:40:08.230" style="s2">to contribute to overpopulation blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.700" end="00:40:10.150" style="s2">blah blah at the same time I will not be</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.230" end="00:40:13.059" style="s2">adopting children either because I still</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.150" end="00:40:14.829" style="s2">don&#39;t want children yeah I like to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.059" end="00:40:17.049" style="s2">in I don&#39;t want plastic oh I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.829" end="00:40:17.619" style="s2">to step on Legos it&#39;s a it&#39;s purely</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.049" end="00:40:20.680" style="s2">aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.619" end="00:40:23.140" style="s2">yes well I&#39;m a parent and I suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.680" end="00:40:26.019" style="s2">the delusion that it&#39;s marvelous yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.140" end="00:40:27.670" style="s2">and the world needs more children with</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.019" end="00:40:29.249" style="s2">parents like you but to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.670" end="00:40:31.630" style="s2">you don&#39;t want kids don&#39;t have them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.249" end="00:40:33.910" style="s2">but the fact that you&#39;re going to take</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.630" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">your next breath mm-hmm please the lie</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.910" end="00:40:39.720" style="s2">to the idea I mean we could just wait</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:43.269" style="s2">see still breathing yep all right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.720" end="00:40:47.470" style="s2">that puts the lie to the idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.269" end="00:40:49.390" style="s2">really okay to let humanity run its</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.470" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">course well for the individual right so</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.390" end="00:40:52.930" style="s2">but for the future generations that</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:54.670" style="s2">don&#39;t exist I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.930" end="00:40:55.210" style="s2">anything inherently sort of tragic about</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.670" end="00:40:58.019" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.210" end="00:41:03.190" style="s2">oh there kind of is maybe a poetic way</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.019" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way I know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.190" end="00:41:11.430" style="s2">die I know Humanity is gonna go extinct</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:13.779" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t diminish my desire to a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.430" end="00:41:16.089" style="s2">see what I can make of the short period</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.779" end="00:41:20.859" style="s2">of time that I have on the planet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.089" end="00:41:22.779" style="s2">an amazingly cool game and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.859" end="00:41:24.759" style="s2">that philosophically speaking there is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.779" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">sort of an objective that I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.759" end="00:41:28.210" style="s2">all thought really clearly and talked to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.440" end="00:41:30.099" style="s2">each other and you know spent a few</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.210" end="00:41:31.450" style="s2">years getting getting it sorted out I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.099" end="00:41:34.809" style="s2">think there&#39;s a thing that we would land</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.450" end="00:41:38.170" style="s2">on that&#39;s actually like the moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.809" end="00:41:40.059" style="s2">imperative right the singular top moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.170" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">imperative and I know a person who says</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.059" end="00:41:47.980" style="s2">such a thing has to be kind of crazy but</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:51.339" style="s2">because life is cool we are more or less</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.980" end="00:41:54.609" style="s2">obligated to see how many human beings</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.339" end="00:41:56.289" style="s2">we can give that experience yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.609" end="00:41:58.599" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s a pretty utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.289" end="00:42:00.999" style="s2">argument yes except you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.599" end="00:42:02.650" style="s2">careful with it because that does not</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.999" end="00:42:05.589" style="s2">mean let&#39;s see how many people we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.650" end="00:42:06.819" style="s2">get on no equality right might order for</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.589" end="00:42:09.460" style="s2">it to be quality in order for it to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.819" end="00:42:10.440" style="s2">really liberate us to do cool amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.460" end="00:42:12.210" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.440" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">the population has to be low enough a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.210" end="00:42:16.470" style="s2">rate of consumption has to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:18.150" style="s2">sustainable all of that but if we could</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.470" end="00:42:21.270" style="s2">do that if we could stabilize the earth</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.150" end="00:42:25.170" style="s2">so that there is no expiration date on</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.270" end="00:42:28.170" style="s2">humanity sure right then how many people</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.170" end="00:42:29.190" style="s2">are we giving this marvelous gift of hey</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.170" end="00:42:32.580" style="s2">you know what you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.190" end="00:42:35.010" style="s2">85 cool years in which to see what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.580" end="00:42:37.410" style="s2">can create it&#39;s the most amazing video</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.010" end="00:42:39.540" style="s2">game there ever was you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.410" end="00:42:42.600" style="s2">build you can create insight art</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.540" end="00:42:44.820" style="s2">whatever you want to do that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.600" end="00:42:48.420" style="s2">a wonderful gift to give to people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.820" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">to give up on humanity is to deny it to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.420" end="00:42:52.230" style="s2">an indefinitely large number of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:54.840" style="s2">downstream of us I agree with that but</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.230" end="00:42:57.090" style="s2">there is also a truth it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.840" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">that life is also suffering I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.090" end="00:43:03.600" style="s2">suicide is one of the the highest causes</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:06.030" style="s2">of deaths in the Western world you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.600" end="00:43:09.450" style="s2">so life is cool but life is also</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.030" end="00:43:13.200" style="s2">terrible um well let&#39;s unpack that a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.450" end="00:43:15.780" style="s2">little bit hmm there is suffering in</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.200" end="00:43:17.340" style="s2">life life wouldn&#39;t make any sense if</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.780" end="00:43:18.660" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t some right each individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.340" end="00:43:21.510" style="s2">has to face a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.660" end="00:43:23.850" style="s2">suffering in fact suffering is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.510" end="00:43:26.490" style="s2">an adaptation oh yeah yeah hazard yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.850" end="00:43:28.530" style="s2">um that does not mean that intolerable</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.490" end="00:43:30.570" style="s2">levels of suffering of the kind that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.530" end="00:43:32.610" style="s2">cause people to kill themselves are okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.570" end="00:43:35.220" style="s2">or even they were stuck with them right</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.610" end="00:43:37.740" style="s2">so the thing I&#39;m imagining that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.220" end="00:43:40.890" style="s2">sort of obligated to pursue is a world</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.740" end="00:43:42.870" style="s2">in which nobody has to face that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.890" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">despair mm-hmm right yeah so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.870" end="00:43:48.900" style="s2">talking a real low population here not</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:51.510" style="s2">necessarily you know look if I was if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.900" end="00:43:53.580" style="s2">was dictating the course I would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.510" end="00:43:54.960" style="s2">look we&#39;ve gotten to a place where</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:58.200" style="s2">almost everything can be done</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.960" end="00:44:01.110" style="s2">electrically okay so let us shift to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.200" end="00:44:03.090" style="s2">electric why well number of reasons one</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.110" end="00:44:05.640" style="s2">it&#39;s healthier at the point that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.090" end="00:44:07.820" style="s2">involved in the activity right electric</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.640" end="00:44:10.320" style="s2">cars don&#39;t pollute they don&#39;t get asthma</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.820" end="00:44:13.560" style="s2">all that now do they flew somewhere sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.320" end="00:44:15.630" style="s2">at the coal plant but the more important</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.560" end="00:44:18.690" style="s2">point is if you get everything run</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.630" end="00:44:19.530" style="s2">electrically then you pursue fusion</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.690" end="00:44:22.140" style="s2">power mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.530" end="00:44:23.910" style="s2">and the thing is fusion power actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.140" end="00:44:26.279" style="s2">allows us</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:31.500" style="s2">fossil fuels we might be able to set a</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.970" end="00:44:33.720" style="s2">carrying capacity it could be quite a</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.500" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">bit higher right it could be three or</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.720" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">four billion people right and they could</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:41.849" style="s2">live at a very high quality of life and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:43.589" style="s2">if you&#39;ve made everything electric then</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.849" end="00:44:45.240" style="s2">at the point fusion energy becomes</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.589" end="00:44:46.529" style="s2">viable actually you can take all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.240" end="00:44:48.150" style="s2">stuff that you&#39;re already using and just</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.529" end="00:44:51.180" style="s2">plug it into a different source and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.150" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;ve reached a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.180" end="00:44:56.640" style="s2">sustainable alternative mode for human</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:58.859" style="s2">existence and so the way I see this we</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.640" end="00:45:01.619" style="s2">are up against the wall with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.859" end="00:45:04.410" style="s2">the unsustainability crisis fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.619" end="00:45:07.140" style="s2">being one manifestation of that but far</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.410" end="00:45:10.710" style="s2">from the only one but we are you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.140" end="00:45:12.569" style="s2">we&#39;re standing on one edge of a gap the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.710" end="00:45:13.980" style="s2">other edge of the gap is the point at</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.569" end="00:45:16.680" style="s2">which we figured out how to do something</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.980" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">l elegantly with electricity and how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.680" end="00:45:21.059" style="s2">fuel it ultimately with fusion power</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:23.309" style="s2">right but it&#39;s also a political issue so</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.059" end="00:45:25.529" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a technological fix I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.309" end="00:45:28.019" style="s2">you have both Bernie Sanders and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.529" end="00:45:30.029" style="s2">Elizabeth Warren one of you might be our</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.019" end="00:45:31.890" style="s2">next president talking about not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.029" end="00:45:33.420" style="s2">not building any more nuclear plants</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.890" end="00:45:35.819" style="s2">decommissioning the ones that we already</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.420" end="00:45:38.250" style="s2">have oh I want them to get decommission</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.819" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">so you want okay so so take everything</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.250" end="00:45:43.140" style="s2">all of the existing nuclear do you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">mention that and just use a dead end</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.140" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">yeah and is a deadly dead end right</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:50.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a Faustian bargain of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:53.819" style="s2">kind mm-hmm Fusion is a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.910" end="00:45:55.950" style="s2">ballgame mm-hmm right for many different</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.819" end="00:45:59.069" style="s2">reasons one it doesn&#39;t have the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.950" end="00:46:01.410" style="s2">meltdown it doesn&#39;t create the fuel this</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.069" end="00:46:02.970" style="s2">long-standing spent fuel that we still</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.410" end="00:46:06.630" style="s2">have no idea what the hell to do with</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.970" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">why can&#39;t we just take it up in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.630" end="00:46:11.220" style="s2">and and dismiss it</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:13.410" style="s2">Oh launch it into the side unless that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.220" end="00:46:15.180" style="s2">a great idea except for one problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.410" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">which is that launching stuff into space</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.180" end="00:46:20.910" style="s2">a and B it doesn&#39;t work all that well</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:22.170" style="s2">things blow up and we would enter how</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.910" end="00:46:24.269" style="s2">about we take it to the moon and launch</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.170" end="00:46:26.039" style="s2">it from the moon well you got to get it</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.269" end="00:46:30.029" style="s2">to the moon okay so look this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.039" end="00:46:33.359" style="s2">bad idea if you could generate a fission</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.029" end="00:46:35.819" style="s2">power in space beam it into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.359" end="00:46:37.080" style="s2">atmosphere safely which I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.819" end="00:46:38.340" style="s2">that we know that we could</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.080" end="00:46:40.620" style="s2">possible even if you could put the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.340" end="00:46:42.510" style="s2">reactors in space beam the energy down</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.620" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">that you would end up ionizing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.510" end="00:46:46.920" style="s2">atmosphere anyway that would be the next</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:49.980" style="s2">devastating crisis but if you could do</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.920" end="00:46:52.260" style="s2">fission power in space and then launch</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.980" end="00:46:53.820" style="s2">the products into the Sun I&#39;m all for</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.260" end="00:46:56.130" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s not that I&#39;m against</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.820" end="00:46:58.140" style="s2">fusion feasible it&#39;s just not safe</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.130" end="00:47:00.030" style="s2">fusion still has a branding issue they</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.140" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">may want to stop calling it nuclear I</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.030" end="00:47:05.160" style="s2">mean it&#39;s just it seems it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:08.310" style="s2">the same thing yeah except boy am I</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.160" end="00:47:10.620" style="s2">going to love being its champion so is</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.310" end="00:47:14.670" style="s2">this gonna be small reactors and people</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.620" end="00:47:16.230" style="s2">like micro micro grids or whatever do</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.670" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">you picture this as like actually large</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.230" end="00:47:21.150" style="s2">large vision or large fusion reactors</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:22.740" style="s2">none they don&#39;t have to be immense but</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.150" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not you don&#39;t get up your personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.740" end="00:47:29.370" style="s2">fusion reactor as far as we know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:31.230" style="s2">know if you know the unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.370" end="00:47:35.700" style="s2">fusion is gonna lead us to cold fusion</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.230" end="00:47:38.280" style="s2">which is a morass um because for lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.700" end="00:47:40.910" style="s2">reasons probably there is no cold fusion</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.280" end="00:47:43.260" style="s2">but it ain&#39;t as settled as people think</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.910" end="00:47:45.390" style="s2">but anyway I&#39;m talking about hot fusion</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.260" end="00:47:47.940" style="s2">but the nice thing among the nice things</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.390" end="00:47:52.530" style="s2">about hot fusion is that as soon as your</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.940" end="00:47:54.780" style="s2">hot fusion reaction stops abiding by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.530" end="00:47:57.300" style="s2">rules of your machine it shuts itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.780" end="00:47:59.130" style="s2">it&#39;s dead Yeah right which is quite the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.300" end="00:48:00.660" style="s2">opposite with vision right vision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.130" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">like and you have to have you have to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.660" end="00:48:04.470" style="s2">Menken maintain control over it and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.330" style="s2">minute you lose control or the water</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.470" end="00:48:07.830" style="s2">evaporates or whatever right the amount</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.330" end="00:48:10.080" style="s2">of water you have to pump through to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.830" end="00:48:12.960" style="s2">keep it cool enough not to melt down as</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.080" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">isn&#39;t mass so anyway fusion power may</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.960" end="00:48:18.900" style="s2">have and in fact what I always say is</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">nuclear power isn&#39;t one thing it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.900" end="00:48:23.160" style="s2">opposite things right and fusion power</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:26.190" style="s2">is the one we should be betting on on</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.160" end="00:48:27.690" style="s2">for anyway the nuclear power industry is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.190" end="00:48:30.390" style="s2">really the fission industries right</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.690" end="00:48:31.950" style="s2">right they&#39;re not backing it right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.390" end="00:48:34.890" style="s2">the fossil fuel industry obviously has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.950" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">tremendous amount to lose right um okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.890" end="00:48:40.440" style="s2">well where have we ended up I feel I</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:44.520" style="s2">feel reassured that climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.440" end="00:48:47.670" style="s2">happening and less optimistic about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.520" end="00:48:49.770" style="s2">future than I did 10 minutes ago Paso so</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.670" end="00:48:51.800" style="s2">I feel both better and worse well okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.770" end="00:48:51.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.710" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">let me suggest an approach</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.330" end="00:49:00.580" style="s2">philosophically here first of all let me</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:03.670" style="s2">just point out something I&#39;ve called the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.580" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">activists dilemma which is that about</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.670" end="00:49:08.109" style="s2">half the people are motivated by their</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.880" style="s2">fear of what&#39;s going to happen if we do</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.109" end="00:49:11.800" style="s2">nothing and half the people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.880" end="00:49:13.690" style="s2">motivated by hope about what we might</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.800" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">accomplish and you can talk to either</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.690" end="00:49:16.930" style="s2">group in isolation with no problem but</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:19.240" style="s2">if you try to talk to them at the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.930" end="00:49:21.030" style="s2">time you&#39;re always at cross-purposes</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.240" end="00:49:28.180" style="s2">with yourself and it never goes well</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.030" end="00:49:30.130" style="s2">so the fear that you are describing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.180" end="00:49:32.740" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s too late maybe the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.130" end="00:49:35.170" style="s2">too big maybe you know maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.740" end="00:49:36.910" style="s2">gonna live to see the end of this right</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.170" end="00:49:41.380" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.910" end="00:49:42.730" style="s2">that&#39;s an abyss mm-hmm and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.380" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">know you and I don&#39;t know each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.730" end="00:49:46.740" style="s2">that well but my guess would be that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:49.000" style="s2">want to spend a little bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.740" end="00:49:51.010" style="s2">staring into the abyss and make your</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.000" end="00:49:53.430" style="s2">peace with that yeah right yeah cuz at</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.010" end="00:49:55.830" style="s2">the point that you realize you know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.430" end="00:49:58.660" style="s2">we&#39;ve already miss played our cards</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.830" end="00:50:01.089" style="s2">we&#39;re in very serious danger and this</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.660" end="00:50:03.940" style="s2">will probably it&#39;s probably not rescue</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.089" end="00:50:06.010" style="s2">about but I don&#39;t know it&#39;s not rescue</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.940" end="00:50:09.580" style="s2">well and if we did rescue it that would</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.010" end="00:50:12.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a noble thing to dedicate</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.580" end="00:50:14.140" style="s2">yourself to while you&#39;re here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.070" end="00:50:18.040" style="s2">pretty exciting right it&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.140" end="00:50:20.410" style="s2">fits the superhero ethos of the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.040" end="00:50:22.320" style="s2">right to sort of say well we</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.410" end="00:50:25.480" style="s2">actually do have to save the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.320" end="00:50:28.570" style="s2">you know we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.480" end="00:50:30.550" style="s2">take the tools we&#39;ve got and address</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.570" end="00:50:32.290" style="s2">that problem and you know well what do</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.550" end="00:50:34.359" style="s2">you think about you know people like</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.290" end="00:50:36.190" style="s2">Jeff Bezos saying like what have you say</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.359" end="00:50:37.540" style="s2">the only way to deploy in my wealth</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.190" end="00:50:39.310" style="s2">would be to send it to space you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.540" end="00:50:40.780" style="s2">this idea that what or Elon Musk&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.310" end="00:50:43.180" style="s2">idea that what we need to be doing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.780" end="00:50:45.160" style="s2">colonizing Mars and uninhabitable planet</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.240" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">I think there are a lot of escapist</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.250" end="00:51:53.250" style="s2">fantasies and the problem is that a some</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:57.430" style="s2">of these escapist fantasies are probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.250" end="00:51:59.740" style="s2">serving a purpose to a point in other</p>

<p begin="00:52:02.589" end="00:52:09.940" style="s2">driving me this you know there&#39;s spackle</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.820" end="00:52:12.190" style="s2">in some places it&#39;s not perfectly worked</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.940" end="00:52:13.510" style="s2">out and logical such that it all stands</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.190" end="00:52:15.910" style="s2">up to scrutiny but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.560" end="00:52:22.359" style="s2">stuff that needs doing right and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.109" end="00:52:24.609" style="s2">know it&#39;s a little bit like our visual</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.359" end="00:52:27.099" style="s2">understanding of our world you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.609" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">got heuristics all over the place by and</p>

<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:34.210" style="s2"> right right so that&#39;s good these</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:36.280" style="s2">stories may be doing that job for</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.210" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">certain people but my fear is that when</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.280" end="00:52:41.560" style="s2">Elon Musk talks about colonizing Mars</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:43.240" style="s2">people take him serious right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.560" end="00:52:44.470" style="s2">not that getting to Mars is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.240" end="00:52:46.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not that it&#39;s even inconceivable</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.470" end="00:52:48.099" style="s2">that you could colonize it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.030" end="00:52:50.770" style="s2">in the immediate offing no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.099" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">goodie I don&#39;t even see this desirable I</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.770" end="00:52:54.339" style="s2">mean I saw that movie with Matt Damon</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:56.050" style="s2">like he like he has to use his own</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.339" end="00:52:59.890" style="s2">to fertilize his potatoes like we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.050" end="00:53:01.930" style="s2">we have a miraculous planet I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.890" end="00:53:05.770" style="s2">that&#39;s where I sort of see the most hope</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.930" end="00:53:08.950" style="s2">and the most sort of fear is I spend a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.770" end="00:53:10.420" style="s2">lot of time in nature and it&#39;s stunning</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.950" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">and you and I live in one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.420" end="00:53:14.260" style="s2">beautiful parts of the country and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:15.790" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of remarkably I&#39;m blown away</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.260" end="00:53:18.259" style="s2">every day every when I take my ferry</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.790" end="00:53:21.170" style="s2">ride blown away by the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.259" end="00:53:24.829" style="s2">and the landscape around me and at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.170" end="00:53:26.599" style="s2">same time I&#39;m just so depressed about</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.829" end="00:53:28.430" style="s2">what is happening to this much more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.599" end="00:53:29.749" style="s2">much more depressed about the state of</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.430" end="00:53:31.640" style="s2">the planet about pollution and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.749" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">sustainability than I am sort of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.640" end="00:53:38.329" style="s2">happening socially in some ways well you</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:41.959" style="s2">know in the answer to how you address it</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.329" end="00:53:46.849" style="s2">has to be philosophical you got to find</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.959" end="00:53:49.519" style="s2">a way to make your peace with the cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.849" end="00:53:53.029" style="s2">joke you are on the greatest planet that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.519" end="00:53:56.539" style="s2">we are aware of it is being degraded but</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.029" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">it&#39;s still absolutely marvelous and at</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.539" end="00:54:02.569" style="s2">every scale you know I mean look into</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:04.039" style="s2">moss or the microscope and ya see</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.569" end="00:54:07.579" style="s2">amazing stuff yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.039" end="00:54:11.380" style="s2">and so there&#39;s plenty this is a tragic</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.579" end="00:54:14.660" style="s2">moment but it is also a moment at which</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.380" end="00:54:20.660" style="s2">your life matters a lot because what</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.660" end="00:54:22.339" style="s2">happens next is uncertain and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.660" end="00:54:25.660" style="s2">everybody is going to need to find their</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.339" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">individual way to make peace with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.660" end="00:54:34.579" style="s2">absurdity and the horror and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">possibility of this moment but having</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.579" end="00:54:42.349" style="s2">done so you sometimes I call myself an</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:44.719" style="s2">accidental Buddhist because although</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.349" end="00:54:46.939" style="s2">I&#39;ve never studied Buddhism I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.719" end="00:54:49.999" style="s2">religious person by nature I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.939" end="00:54:51.619" style="s2">many of the thoughts if you push them</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.999" end="00:54:53.809" style="s2">far enough that&#39;s where they end up</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.619" end="00:55:00.709" style="s2">bright in that neighborhood and I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.809" end="00:55:03.109" style="s2">there is a kind of there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.709" end="00:55:05.779" style="s2">enlightenment once you realize what this</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.109" end="00:55:07.489" style="s2">moment is and how improbable you are and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.779" end="00:55:09.650" style="s2">how improbable it is that you would land</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.489" end="00:55:12.469" style="s2">in this moment and be aware of what it</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.650" end="00:55:14.359" style="s2">was and actually potentially have some</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.469" end="00:55:17.679" style="s2">influence over it because people listen</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.359" end="00:55:20.689" style="s2">to you or something like that well I</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.679" end="00:55:23.179" style="s2">call it the cosmic joke right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.689" end="00:55:26.259" style="s2">it&#39;s a very funny joke in a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.179" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">would end up in that odd situation and</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.259" end="00:55:31.250" style="s2">it does potentially give meaning to</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:36.080" style="s2">every day</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.250" end="00:55:38.450" style="s2">yeah do you if you could go back and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.080" end="00:55:40.070" style="s2">tell yourself you&#39;re you know from 10</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.450" end="00:55:41.540" style="s2">years ago or whatever you know 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.070" end="00:55:44.030" style="s2">from now you&#39;re not gonna be teaching</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.540" end="00:55:46.609" style="s2">anymore but you&#39;ll be a sort of public</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.030" end="00:55:50.690" style="s2">figure would you have been surprised by</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.609" end="00:55:52.580" style="s2">this in truth yeah no I sort of feel the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.690" end="00:55:54.980" style="s2">same way about myself I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.580" end="00:55:57.740" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in fate anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.980" end="00:56:00.920" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe in predestination I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.740" end="00:56:02.540" style="s2">always thought and I&#39;ve done very little</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.920" end="00:56:03.619" style="s2">work to like actually get myself to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.540" end="00:56:06.170" style="s2">position but I&#39;ve always that like</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.619" end="00:56:08.540" style="s2">there&#39;s one paper I want to work for and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.170" end="00:56:10.130" style="s2">I work for it I didn&#39;t do that much work</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.540" end="00:56:11.690" style="s2">like you know I did where I did work</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.130" end="00:56:13.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s totally stumbled in</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.690" end="00:56:14.390" style="s2">this but there have been this sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.160" end="00:56:16.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know a series of happenstance</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.390" end="00:56:18.020" style="s2">things that have happened to put me in</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.010" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">this position not getting some jobs</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.020" end="00:56:23.990" style="s2">getting some jobs that it once seems</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:28.220" style="s2">incredibly random and also totally</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.990" end="00:56:31.160" style="s2">inevitable yeah yeah I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.220" end="00:56:32.830" style="s2">couple of reasons for that one it might</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.160" end="00:56:35.300" style="s2">be that this is one of these heuristics</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.830" end="00:56:36.680" style="s2">that you sort of need to think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.300" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;d spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.680" end="00:56:40.849" style="s2">trying to figure out how the hell this</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:45.680" style="s2">happened to you right but no I I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.849" end="00:56:51.220" style="s2">feel like everything that led up to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.680" end="00:56:55.010" style="s2">was a an oddly perfect training camp</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.220" end="00:56:58.540" style="s2">right like I I got to see this in</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.010" end="00:57:02.020" style="s2">microcosm before it suddenly became</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.540" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">large-scale and anyway it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.020" end="00:57:07.010" style="s2">oddly natural mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:09.020" style="s2">I feel like an odd person for the job</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.010" end="00:57:10.070" style="s2">right I feel like looking from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.020" end="00:57:13.070" style="s2">outside it&#39;d be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.070" end="00:57:16.849" style="s2">head-scratcher but from the inside yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.070" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">it feels it feels feels right if yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.849" end="00:57:22.760" style="s2">yeah but also tear it&#39;s also terrible</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:24.470" style="s2">but also right you know well but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.760" end="00:57:25.880" style="s2">you know the circumstances that have led</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.470" end="00:57:27.619" style="s2">us to being in the positions that we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.880" end="00:57:29.630" style="s2">in are not necessarily positive ones for</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.619" end="00:57:32.900" style="s2">the culture they are not right they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.630" end="00:57:34.910" style="s2">not on the other hand you know and</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.900" end="00:57:39.380" style="s2">you&#39;re the type specimen for this but</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.910" end="00:57:41.540" style="s2">the number of really fascinating truly</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.380" end="00:57:44.380" style="s2">decent people that I have been put into</p>

<p begin="00:57:44.380" end="00:57:51.069" style="s2">is stunning and the just the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.999" end="00:57:54.390" style="s2">being able to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.069" end="00:57:58.119" style="s2">conversations that matter is you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.390" end="00:58:01.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a privilege it&#39;s delightful most</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.119" end="00:58:03.729" style="s2">days and so anyway I mean you one could</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.869" end="00:58:05.829" style="s2">one could exert a lot of skepticism at</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.729" end="00:58:08.950" style="s2">it but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m not sure why I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.829" end="00:58:12.190" style="s2">think yeah thing is this is a very odd</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.950" end="00:58:14.349" style="s2">thing to have happened but do you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.190" end="00:58:15.849" style="s2">any is there one sort of belief that has</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.349" end="00:58:18.359" style="s2">changed for you since all this happened</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.849" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">something that you&#39;re very shocked to</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.359" end="00:58:21.880" style="s2">realize that you now believe it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:26.619" style="s2">or something that you didn&#39;t that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.880" end="00:58:28.989" style="s2">did believe and now don&#39;t that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.619" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">question and I wish I had a really</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.989" end="00:58:39.130" style="s2">compelling answer for it I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:43.329" style="s2">have been surprised by some people who I</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.130" end="00:58:45.759" style="s2">otherwise would have dismissed telling</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.329" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">other words periodically I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.759" end="00:58:51.849" style="s2">somebody who I would have guessed was</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">just dangerous and broken and then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.849" end="00:58:54.849" style="s2">talk to them and it turns out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:57.609" style="s2">actually on about something that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.849" end="00:58:59.890" style="s2">and yeah that sort of thing yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.609" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">had similar experiences and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.890" end="00:59:07.599" style="s2">and I have also had a similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:10.479" style="s2">and I&#39;m never invited on left-leaning or</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.599" end="00:59:12.369" style="s2">even mainstream like media shows I did</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.479" end="00:59:14.769" style="s2">the gist which is a slate show but</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.369" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s but it&#39;s hosted by Mike Pesce</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.769" end="00:59:19.119" style="s2">who&#39;s sort of a heterodox thinker but</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:22.299" style="s2">I&#39;m in convert I&#39;m on podcast</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.119" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">conservative podcast every week or shows</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.299" end="00:59:28.180" style="s2">like this that are more heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:29.710" style="s2">never never like I&#39;ve been on NPR a</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.180" end="00:59:31.630" style="s2">couple times what those invitations have</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.710" end="00:59:35.619" style="s2">really driven that really dried up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.630" end="00:59:37.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s surprising to me yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.619" end="00:59:43.749" style="s2">think it really tells us were yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.930" end="00:59:46.029" style="s2">um and you know I don&#39;t hate it I sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.749" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">of think it comes down to people like</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.029" end="00:59:51.489" style="s2">you and me who can tell that story and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:53.829" style="s2">just say look the left didn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.489" end="00:59:55.690" style="s2">right this other thing did it&#39;s the true</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.829" end="00:59:57.700" style="s2">level and you don&#39;t know it unless</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.690" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve been paying attention to certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.700" end="01:00:02.619" style="s2">quadrants but but it&#39;s the real deal I</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:05.020" style="s2">find it problematic in the sense that to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.619" end="01:00:06.970" style="s2">borrow a phrase from our STW friends I</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.020" end="01:00:09.549" style="s2">find it problematic in a sense that I</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.970" end="01:00:11.140" style="s2">would like to I would like the things</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.549" end="01:00:13.299" style="s2">that I believe to be reaching a wider</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.140" end="01:00:15.069" style="s2">audience of not just conservatives and</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.299" end="01:00:17.650" style="s2">heterodox figures who are probably more</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.069" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">inclined to you know believe me and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.650" end="01:00:22.210" style="s2">trust me in the first place you know I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.530" end="01:00:24.700" style="s2">would like to be reaching an audience</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.210" end="01:00:27.809" style="s2">that is of the left and disagrees with</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.700" end="01:00:31.089" style="s2">me in a way that we could have some</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.809" end="01:00:33.730" style="s2">constructive dialectic but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.089" end="01:00:37.390" style="s2">happen they don&#39;t want to engage I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.730" end="01:00:39.790" style="s2">it is happening and I think the problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.390" end="01:00:41.740" style="s2">is that we have a wrong story in our</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.790" end="01:00:43.809" style="s2">heads about what to expect about the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.740" end="01:00:47.799" style="s2">people change their minds and broaden</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.809" end="01:00:53.290" style="s2">their minds and so I see a slower game</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.799" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">where you say something you get mocked</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.290" end="01:00:58.270" style="s2">or crushed or whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:01:00.849" style="s2">happens but in that some number of</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.270" end="01:01:02.740" style="s2">people have changed their minds and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.849" end="01:01:05.140" style="s2">point is the next time you confront that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.740" end="01:01:07.420" style="s2">same thing the dynamic unfolds</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.140" end="01:01:08.680" style="s2">differently in a way you can&#39;t detect is</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.420" end="01:01:13.450" style="s2">the result of what happened the first</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.680" end="01:01:16.599" style="s2">time but it is right right and so as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.450" end="01:01:18.940" style="s2">and I&#39;ve talked about I felt very much</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.599" end="01:01:20.950" style="s2">like there was a deliberate attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.940" end="01:01:23.799" style="s2">throw me out of the left because it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.950" end="01:01:26.140" style="s2">very inconvenient for people who were</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.799" end="01:01:29.579" style="s2">self-described left us to have me around</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.140" end="01:01:32.849" style="s2">I own a same thing is true for you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.579" end="01:01:35.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a point at which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.849" end="01:01:36.940" style="s2">accept the offer of okay now you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.770" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">read pilled now you&#39;re a conservative</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.940" end="01:01:42.099" style="s2">right you keep saying no yep same</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:45.160" style="s2">liberal I was I&#39;m not backing down</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.099" end="01:01:47.109" style="s2">you know I&#39;m listening to arguments I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.160" end="01:01:49.059" style="s2">grow if I&#39;ve missed something but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.109" end="01:01:52.030" style="s2">not backing down because I&#39;m unpopular</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.059" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">on the left right right and that has an</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.030" end="01:01:58.599" style="s2">effect mm-hmm people see it and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">listen and so you know on Twitter for</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.599" end="01:02:05.740" style="s2">example sometimes you&#39;ll say something</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:08.950" style="s2">and you&#39;ll get a ton of pushback like</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.740" end="01:02:11.140" style="s2">mean pushback but you&#39;ll also get a huge</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.950" end="01:02:13.090" style="s2">number of likes</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.140" end="01:02:16.330" style="s2">like you can track these things almost</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.090" end="01:02:17.710" style="s2">separately the pushback is the reply</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.330" end="01:02:19.810" style="s2">it&#39;s tricky</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.710" end="01:02:21.730" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s designed to you know to</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.810" end="01:02:23.800" style="s2">penalize you for saying something out</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.730" end="01:02:25.900" style="s2">loud and then the likes because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.800" end="01:02:27.460" style="s2">cheap and they&#39;re not totally anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.900" end="01:02:29.830" style="s2">but they&#39;re close if you&#39;ve got a large</p>

<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:30.490" style="s2">totally yeah so Muhammad who was</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.250" end="01:03:31.660" style="s2">arguably treated worse under Islam than</p>

<p begin="01:05:31.210" end="01:05:35.170" style="s2">remember that you remember the hate and</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.980" end="01:05:37.840" style="s2">not the praise I mean my I do get I do</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.170" end="01:05:40.300" style="s2">get a lot of support I&#39;ve also found</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.840" end="01:05:41.560" style="s2">that support often comes privately and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.300" end="01:05:44.590" style="s2">you might have had this experience as</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.560" end="01:05:47.950" style="s2">well the support is emails the hatest</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.590" end="01:05:50.260" style="s2">weeds yeah although first of all as you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.950" end="01:05:53.230" style="s2">point out and I don&#39;t think just because</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.260" end="01:05:55.420" style="s2">it&#39;s some account that may not even be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.230" end="01:05:57.340" style="s2">real person that it doesn&#39;t matter I</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.420" end="01:05:59.700" style="s2">think those are there to steer the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.340" end="01:06:02.760" style="s2">conversation and so what they&#39;re you may</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.700" end="01:06:04.990" style="s2">blanch at something but the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.760" end="01:06:07.540" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to steer the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.990" end="01:06:09.250" style="s2">about what you&#39;re saying so that it</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.540" end="01:06:12.400" style="s2">lands on certain things it so it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:06:15.190" end="01:06:21.610" style="s2">topics which I get in trouble on one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.140" end="01:06:26.470" style="s2">them has to do with my view of sex and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.610" end="01:06:28.120" style="s2">the way it is unfolding in in Western</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.470" end="01:06:30.280" style="s2">civilization I have the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.120" end="01:06:31.050" style="s2">are treating sex very frivolously so it</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.280" end="01:06:34.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.050" end="01:06:39.220" style="s2">no I&#39;m talking about</p>

<p begin="01:06:39.220" end="01:06:46.180" style="s2">would be more or less this is really</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.420" end="01:06:48.460" style="s2">powerful stuff and we are treating it in</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.180" end="01:06:50.320" style="s2">an incredibly frivolous way so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.460" end="01:06:53.380" style="s2">talking about online dating swiping that</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.320" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">pornography that kind of yeah I&#39;m anti</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:07:00.100" style="s2">I&#39;m anti casual sex hmm I think I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.820" end="01:07:02.410" style="s2">Pro sex I think and I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.100" end="01:07:03.640" style="s2">powerful stuff but it should be treated</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.410" end="01:07:05.160" style="s2">with respect</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.640" end="01:07:08.200" style="s2">same way actually I feel about</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.160" end="01:07:11.320" style="s2">hallucinogenic drugs which is these</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.200" end="01:07:13.140" style="s2">things are power tools I encourage</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.320" end="01:07:16.570" style="s2">people who think that they should be</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.140" end="01:07:18.490" style="s2">experimenting with them to try it but I</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.570" end="01:07:20.680" style="s2">would encourage you not to think of them</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.490" end="01:07:22.119" style="s2">as recreation mm-hmm right so it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.680" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">of that sort of thing but what comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.119" end="01:07:29.020" style="s2">back at me of course on the sex front is</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:31.869" style="s2">that I&#39;m a prude right we&#39;re worse right</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.020" end="01:07:33.760" style="s2">conservative that I meant in so ah yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.869" end="01:07:37.000" style="s2">right which I find this is just an</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.760" end="01:07:39.580" style="s2">amazing accusation because whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.000" end="01:07:42.340" style="s2">you can say about me you have two</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.580" end="01:07:44.140" style="s2">children not only do I have two children</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.340" end="01:07:45.880" style="s2">I&#39;m still married to their mother and</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.140" end="01:07:47.950" style="s2">people stopped me on the street and they</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.880" end="01:07:52.600" style="s2">tell me that I&#39;ve married up yeah which</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.950" end="01:07:55.240" style="s2">I agree right but okay so I&#39;m at least</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.600" end="01:07:57.460" style="s2">not an insult but I think the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.240" end="01:07:59.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna buy this it&#39;s a weird</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.460" end="01:08:03.850" style="s2">insult because it just doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.470" end="01:08:05.859" style="s2">content but but if you point at me and</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.850" end="01:08:07.450" style="s2">you accuse me of being an insult than</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.859" end="01:08:09.250" style="s2">other people who maybe don&#39;t know who I</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.450" end="01:08:12.040" style="s2">am or don&#39;t know who I&#39;m married to or</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.250" end="01:08:15.340" style="s2">write you off right well a in cell is</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.040" end="01:08:17.739" style="s2">like it&#39;s a really grotesque category</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.340" end="01:08:19.450" style="s2">right it has the stigma to it and so if</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.739" end="01:08:22.239" style="s2">you can just get that stigma to land</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.450" end="01:08:24.970" style="s2">nearby something then people like oh I</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.239" end="01:08:26.380" style="s2">don&#39;t want any part of that so what do</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.970" end="01:08:29.410" style="s2">we do about the fact that these</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.380" end="01:08:32.259" style="s2">conversations are being steered around</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.410" end="01:08:34.900" style="s2">us with you know I don&#39;t know what those</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.259" end="01:08:37.630" style="s2">accounts are there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.900" end="01:08:39.160" style="s2">signature that I look for when somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.630" end="01:08:41.680" style="s2">throws something at me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.160" end="01:08:44.589" style="s2">particularly awful pronouns and bio is</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.680" end="01:08:46.420" style="s2">that a significant it&#39;s not that the one</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.589" end="01:08:50.290" style="s2">I see is</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.420" end="01:08:51.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s a weird one it&#39;s they follow a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.290" end="01:08:55.960" style="s2">bunch of people like let&#39;s say they</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.820" end="01:08:59.710" style="s2">follow 700 people they are followed by a</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.960" end="01:09:00.160" style="s2">tiny number of people 150 something like</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.710" end="01:09:02.470" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.160" end="01:09:08.110" style="s2">there in general not followed by anyone</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.470" end="01:09:11.700" style="s2">I know and the account is old mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.110" end="01:09:15.610" style="s2">right they registered in 2012 mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.700" end="01:09:17.620" style="s2">what an old account that has 40</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.610" end="01:09:19.990" style="s2">followers so not someone who</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.620" end="01:09:22.570" style="s2">participates that much well the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.990" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">I was puzzling over this because if it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.570" end="01:09:25.300" style="s2">was a new account I would know what was</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:26.920" style="s2">going on somebody registered a new</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.300" end="01:09:28.360" style="s2">accounts and is using them to steer</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.920" end="01:09:30.130" style="s2">conversations but an old account would</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.360" end="01:09:31.900" style="s2">well I wonder what&#39;s the average number</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.130" end="01:09:32.920" style="s2">of followers had I mean there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.900" end="01:09:34.300" style="s2">know how many millions of people are on</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.920" end="01:09:35.590" style="s2">Twitter but I would assume that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.300" end="01:09:37.240" style="s2">average father account is probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.590" end="01:09:39.280" style="s2">pretty low well the average home owner</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.240" end="01:09:41.020" style="s2">accounts pretty low but you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.280" end="01:09:43.450" style="s2">expect somebody who follows a ton of</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.020" end="01:09:45.460" style="s2">people to have a low follower account</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.450" end="01:09:47.110" style="s2">after a long period of time right unless</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.460" end="01:09:49.000" style="s2">they&#39;re terrible at Twitter which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.110" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">right also possible well a friend of</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.000" end="01:09:53.920" style="s2">mine who is sophisticated about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:57.460" style="s2">sort of thing made the argument that</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.920" end="01:09:59.410" style="s2">what these are are old dormant accounts</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.460" end="01:10:01.810" style="s2">that had easy passwords that have been</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.410" end="01:10:03.310" style="s2">hacked by some huh that is using them to</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.810" end="01:10:05.880" style="s2">steer conversations which actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.310" end="01:10:09.370" style="s2">strikes me as very plausible interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.880" end="01:10:11.980" style="s2">yeah that seems I that seems a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.370" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">conspiratorial to me in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.980" end="01:10:16.240" style="s2">like a lot of I know who my haters are I</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know who they really are but I</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.240" end="01:10:22.510" style="s2">know like theirs so the stranger we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:25.210" style="s2">a fairly vibrant comment section and</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.510" end="01:10:28.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not nearly as vibrant as it was you</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.210" end="01:10:29.560" style="s2">know before social media took when when</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.090" end="01:10:31.330" style="s2">blogging was at its height there would</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.560" end="01:10:33.940" style="s2">be a post with one line and there would</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.330" end="01:10:36.880" style="s2">be 200 comments or whatever so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.940" end="01:10:38.710" style="s2">have that but we do have a community an</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.880" end="01:10:41.320" style="s2">ecosystem for sure and the same name</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.710" end="01:10:44.050" style="s2">show up and I can sort of I know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.320" end="01:10:46.260" style="s2">who I know who doesn&#39;t like me because</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.050" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">they were super obvious about it</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.260" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">quite is why I stopped reading the</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:53.860" style="s2">comments I also I did something recently</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:55.420" style="s2">I turned off notifications from people</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.860" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">who don&#39;t follow me and it has changed</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.420" end="01:10:59.960" style="s2">the conversation it has changed my</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:02.270" style="s2">Twitter experience from one of dread</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.960" end="01:11:04.040" style="s2">so one of just it&#39;s it&#39;s all positive</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.270" end="01:11:05.449" style="s2">because the only people who respond are</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.040" end="01:11:07.580" style="s2">people who follow me already they</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.449" end="01:11:09.469" style="s2">already they presumably don&#39;t hate me</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.580" end="01:11:11.090" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to follow me and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.469" end="01:11:14.030" style="s2">a little guilty about that because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.090" end="01:11:16.850" style="s2">I believe in open dialogue I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.030" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">that criticism is cancellation I do want</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.850" end="01:11:22.429" style="s2">to be sort of open to you know to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:24.650" style="s2">legitimate good-faith criticism but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.429" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">also am sick of hearing it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.650" end="01:11:27.980" style="s2">you know and not the good faith</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.760" end="01:11:29.900" style="s2">criticism I&#39;m sick of hearing at hominem</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.980" end="01:11:32.300" style="s2">attacks and so for me to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.900" end="01:11:34.219" style="s2">function as a as a person in the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.300" end="01:11:36.620" style="s2">if I have something that&#39;s coming out so</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.219" end="01:11:37.820" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be controversial or if</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.620" end="01:11:40.580" style="s2">there&#39;s been something grand about me or</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.820" end="01:11:41.719" style="s2">whatever I just turned off you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.580" end="01:11:42.590" style="s2">mute notifications from everybody</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.719" end="01:11:44.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t follow me and all just</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.590" end="01:11:47.150" style="s2">disappears which is a pretty remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.870" end="01:11:48.739" style="s2">feature of the of the platform that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.150" end="01:11:51.140" style="s2">can just the criticism is there</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.739" end="01:11:53.330" style="s2">I just shielded myself I&#39;ve made my own</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.140" end="01:11:55.489" style="s2">personal echo chamber and I realized</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.330" end="01:11:57.980" style="s2">there are consequences to that well I</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.489" end="01:12:00.650" style="s2">think that this is a an unsettled</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.980" end="01:12:06.350" style="s2">question for all of us who inhabit this</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.650" end="01:12:10.670" style="s2">landscape so there are people like Dave</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.350" end="01:12:14.929" style="s2">Rubin Sam Harris and others who have</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.670" end="01:12:16.640" style="s2">tuned out the criticism right entirely</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.929" end="01:12:18.800" style="s2">Dave muted me giddy</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.640" end="01:12:20.480" style="s2">oh yeah after I I mean granted I was</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.800" end="01:12:21.770" style="s2">being a huge pain in his ass because I</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.480" end="01:12:23.330" style="s2">was trying to get him to respond to a</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.770" end="01:12:25.159" style="s2">piece that I wrote in response to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.330" end="01:12:26.540" style="s2">something he said I mean I had written</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.159" end="01:12:28.520" style="s2">you know a thousand words about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.540" end="01:12:30.230" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t a personal attack or</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.520" end="01:12:31.670" style="s2">anything they don&#39;t he I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.230" end="01:12:33.469" style="s2">me too because I&#39;ve tweeted it at home</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.670" end="01:12:36.530" style="s2">like every day for like a week trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.469" end="01:12:38.300" style="s2">get his attention it failed well I</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.530" end="01:12:40.280" style="s2">understand I mute people all the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.300" end="01:12:44.570" style="s2">well but here&#39;s the thing right you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.280" end="01:12:46.820" style="s2">to understand dave has deployed a filter</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.570" end="01:12:49.250" style="s2">that is very intense in part because</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.820" end="01:12:49.730" style="s2">what comes out after him is quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.250" end="01:12:54.020" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.730" end="01:12:55.400" style="s2">yeah and largely unfair yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.020" end="01:12:57.590" style="s2">saying that there&#39;s not a critique to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.400" end="01:13:00.380" style="s2">level and I&#39;ve leveled against him not</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.590" end="01:13:02.710" style="s2">against him but to him multiple times</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.380" end="01:13:05.270" style="s2">but some of what he gets is just</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.710" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">tremendously mean and unfair and not</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.270" end="01:13:10.010" style="s2">decent right so we all have to set the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.719" style="s2">slider somewhere are we gonna listen to</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.010" end="01:13:12.420" style="s2">nothing from the landscape are we gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.719" end="01:13:14.460" style="s2">listen to</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.420" end="01:13:15.840" style="s2">everything which is bewildering in and</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.460" end="01:13:20.429" style="s2">of itself or are we going to go it</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.840" end="01:13:24.660" style="s2">somewhere in between every place you set</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.429" end="01:13:26.550" style="s2">the slider has significant costs mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.660" end="01:13:27.570" style="s2">I think you&#39;d be a fool to set it all</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.550" end="01:13:28.890" style="s2">the way in one direction or the other</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.570" end="01:13:36.660" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.890" end="01:13:40.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve died but how you how you filter</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.660" end="01:13:43.050" style="s2">what you hear so that the critique that</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.170" end="01:13:45.540" style="s2">you need to hear gets through and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.050" end="01:13:47.429" style="s2">critique that you maybe can&#39;t afford to</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.540" end="01:13:50.100" style="s2">take seriously because it&#39;s not legit</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.429" end="01:13:52.980" style="s2">and it&#39;s designed to to tie you in knots</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.100" end="01:13:56.910" style="s2">right how you sort between those things</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.980" end="01:13:59.070" style="s2">is a little bit of an art form and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.910" end="01:14:00.510" style="s2">also a moving target because whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.070" end="01:14:02.130" style="s2">is that&#39;s trying to get to us whether</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.510" end="01:14:04.230" style="s2">it&#39;s individuals who are just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.130" end="01:14:06.050" style="s2">get into our heads or it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.230" end="01:14:08.760" style="s2">more organized than that that wants to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.050" end="01:14:13.679" style="s2">do away with the alternative</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.760" end="01:14:21.060" style="s2">conversation it is trying out new</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.679" end="01:14:23.010" style="s2">stratagems all the time and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.060" end="01:14:25.830" style="s2">know exactly what to say but I will say</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.010" end="01:14:29.400" style="s2">there you unread it at all I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.830" end="01:14:31.730" style="s2">post I look at some Larssen yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.400" end="01:14:38.010" style="s2">do more lurking on reddit than anything</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.730" end="01:14:42.300" style="s2">but I&#39;ve noticed that subreddits go</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.010" end="01:14:45.050" style="s2">toxic mm-hmm right Sam Harris a</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.300" end="01:14:48.690" style="s2">subreddit has gone absolutely toxic</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.050" end="01:14:50.280" style="s2">toxic left is it so it&#39;s just infighting</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.690" end="01:14:52.080" style="s2">among his fans or is this infiltration</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.280" end="01:14:52.800" style="s2">of people who don&#39;t like Harris in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.080" end="01:14:57.960" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.800" end="01:15:00.420" style="s2">I think so I think there are two Sam</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.960" end="01:15:05.030" style="s2">Harris subreddits and one of them has</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.420" end="01:15:06.540" style="s2">been effectively captured by some woke</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.030" end="01:15:09.030" style="s2">something or other</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.540" end="01:15:10.590" style="s2">mm-hmm and it just impossible have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.030" end="01:15:13.020" style="s2">conversation but the point is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.590" end="01:15:16.710" style="s2">think Sam necessarily knows that because</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.020" end="01:15:19.949" style="s2">I don&#39;t do it right and the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.710" end="01:15:22.230" style="s2">it is having some effect on how Sam is</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.949" end="01:15:25.560" style="s2">understood in the world right that Sam</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.230" end="01:15:29.160" style="s2">cannot navigate because he&#39;s unaware</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.560" end="01:15:30.840" style="s2">right and anyway I think all of us are</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.160" end="01:15:32.580" style="s2">in some danger so I don&#39;t know where to</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.840" end="01:15:33.900" style="s2">set the slider but yeah that it is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.580" end="01:15:39.150" style="s2">slider is important yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.900" end="01:15:41.660" style="s2">interesting every online subculture that</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.150" end="01:15:46.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve observed has turn toxic every one</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.660" end="01:15:49.500" style="s2">knitting mushroom hunting podcasts you</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.920" end="01:15:53.490" style="s2">know fans of murder podcast or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.500" end="01:15:55.200" style="s2">at some point a community that seems you</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.490" end="01:15:58.140" style="s2">know supportive and just there for the</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.200" end="01:15:59.760" style="s2">love of the thing always turns toxic and</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.140" end="01:16:01.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why that is if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.760" end="01:16:04.080" style="s2">something particular about about online</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.980" end="01:16:05.580" style="s2">discourse or the moment that we&#39;re in or</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.080" end="01:16:08.400" style="s2">a human you know the nature of what it</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.580" end="01:16:09.840" style="s2">is to be a human in general but I just</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.400" end="01:16:12.330" style="s2">see it over and over again every every</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.840" end="01:16:14.850" style="s2">Facebook page every you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.330" end="01:16:16.890" style="s2">they&#39;ll be a they&#39;ll be a group the</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.850" end="01:16:18.600" style="s2">group will will splinter off because</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.890" end="01:16:20.220" style="s2">there&#39;s too much infighting in the main</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.600" end="01:16:21.630" style="s2">group and then that group lasts for a</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.220" end="01:16:22.740" style="s2">little while and then that group falls</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.630" end="01:16:24.060" style="s2">apart because there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.740" end="01:16:29.550" style="s2">infighting in that group it just seems</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.060" end="01:16:31.830" style="s2">to be a feature I wonder so Eric said</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.550" end="01:16:33.330" style="s2">something I forgotten where he said it</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.830" end="01:16:36.810" style="s2">but publicly he said something about the</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.330" end="01:16:39.180" style="s2">necessity to to have a degree of elitism</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.810" end="01:16:42.150" style="s2">and it was badly misunderstood by people</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.180" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">I know exactly what he was saying it had</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.150" end="01:16:47.670" style="s2">to do with the necessity to restrict</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:49.410" style="s2">conversations to those who are ready to</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.670" end="01:16:53.310" style="s2">have them and take them seriously sure</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.410" end="01:16:55.310" style="s2">right and I think the problem you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.310" end="01:16:59.250" style="s2">pointing to is that every online</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.310" end="01:17:00.900" style="s2">discussion a there&#39;s a kind of social</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.250" end="01:17:02.850" style="s2">entropy phenomenon where it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.900" end="01:17:06.210" style="s2">easier to disrupt a conversation than it</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.850" end="01:17:08.730" style="s2">is to build one and so how long can a</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.210" end="01:17:10.970" style="s2">conversation exist before something gets</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.730" end="01:17:14.460" style="s2">into it that just ties it in a knot yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.970" end="01:17:17.400" style="s2">the only antidote would be a force that</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.460" end="01:17:19.740" style="s2">allowed you to bar more gatekeeping</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.400" end="01:17:21.330" style="s2">yeah and more gatekeeping yes then does</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.740" end="01:17:24.600" style="s2">have an elitist problem which is you</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.330" end="01:17:26.370" style="s2">know want to bar people from the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.600" end="01:17:29.190" style="s2">conversation who are heterodox right</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.370" end="01:17:32.490" style="s2">right so anyway that&#39;s an unsolved</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.190" end="01:17:35.220" style="s2">problem but I do think we&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.490" end="01:17:36.930" style="s2">from too much gatekeeping in some places</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.220" end="01:17:39.150" style="s2">and too little gatekeeping in others</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.930" end="01:17:43.739" style="s2">yeah I would agree with that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.150" end="01:17:46.230" style="s2">serious problem mm-hmm so I heard you</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.739" end="01:17:48.300" style="s2">say something on the panel last night</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.230" end="01:17:51.239" style="s2">which reminded me of something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.300" end="01:17:55.080" style="s2">heard Heather say and I think it makes</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.239" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">sense for us to talk about here you said</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.080" end="01:18:01.949" style="s2">that because you were a tomboy that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:05.030" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid that if you were young in</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.949" end="01:18:11.340" style="s2">this era that you might find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.030" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">pushed towards transitioning and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.340" end="01:18:17.520" style="s2">that would be a regrettable right so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.719" end="01:18:19.710" style="s2">so I think that I think that I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.520" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">have if I were 15 years old right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.710" end="01:18:23.940" style="s2">and I was online and the people around</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:26.250" style="s2">me were transitioning or saying or</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.940" end="01:18:28.920" style="s2">non-binary whatever I think I would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.250" end="01:18:31.650" style="s2">one of them I was you know sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.920" end="01:18:33.600" style="s2">new narrative is that if you are a girl</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.650" end="01:18:35.100" style="s2">who likes quote/unquote boy things if</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.600" end="01:18:36.480" style="s2">you have short hair and like the color</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.100" end="01:18:39.360" style="s2">blue and play sports I was the only girl</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.480" end="01:18:41.850" style="s2">in Little League I was that kid then</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.360" end="01:18:44.820" style="s2">you&#39;re not a girl you&#39;re a bit you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.850" end="01:18:47.969" style="s2">literal male and I think I would have</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.820" end="01:18:51.030" style="s2">been captured by that that said I also</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.969" end="01:18:53.370" style="s2">happen to be the child of a man who</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.030" end="01:18:56.610" style="s2">taught human sexuality and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.370" end="01:18:58.080" style="s2">psychology for 30 years and who is very</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.610" end="01:19:00.780" style="s2">familiar with the what the work of</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.080" end="01:19:03.900" style="s2">Michael Bailey and Ray Blanchard and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.780" end="01:19:07.409" style="s2">I happen to have a father who is much</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.900" end="01:19:09.659" style="s2">more probably critical and aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.409" end="01:19:12.120" style="s2">evidence and the data around transition</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.659" end="01:19:15.000" style="s2">than most people would have so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.120" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">sure that my parents would have allowed</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.000" end="01:19:20.219" style="s2">me to do some sort of yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:22.380" style="s2">juvenile transition but that&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.219" end="01:19:27.810" style="s2">people&#39;s dads are not sex professors</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.380" end="01:19:29.100" style="s2">yeah yeah so okay so you you believe you</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.810" end="01:19:29.850" style="s2">that you would have been drawn in that</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.100" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.850" end="01:19:32.730" style="s2">and I think I think I would have been I</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:34.320" style="s2">think my parents probably would have</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.730" end="01:19:36.570" style="s2">been resistant to it and I would have</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.320" end="01:19:38.790" style="s2">pushed you would have pushed which would</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.570" end="01:19:41.550" style="s2">puts you at the very least we can say it</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.790" end="01:19:42.929" style="s2">would have created a corrosive problem</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.550" end="01:19:44.730" style="s2">for your relationship with your parents</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.929" end="01:19:45.870" style="s2">or sure and teenagers already have</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.730" end="01:19:47.400" style="s2">corrosive relationships with their</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.870" end="01:19:48.690" style="s2">parents so this this just would have</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.400" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">been the thing instead of whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.690" end="01:19:51.450" style="s2">was the thing when I was 15 or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:53.940" style="s2">and if we Jenna</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.450" end="01:19:56.250" style="s2">realize because most people&#39;s deaths</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.940" end="01:20:00.060" style="s2">don&#39;t write teach evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.250" end="01:20:02.070" style="s2">psychology the toolkit to know how to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.060" end="01:20:06.960" style="s2">even respond to this there&#39;s no tool it</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.070" end="01:20:09.180" style="s2">there&#39;s no tool kit and this raises so</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.960" end="01:20:12.570" style="s2">many frightening questions I mean so you</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.180" end="01:20:16.770" style="s2">know Heather was absolutely a tomboy</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.570" end="01:20:19.020" style="s2">also and I must say one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.770" end="01:20:20.400" style="s2">think it takes a while to understand</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.020" end="01:20:22.470" style="s2">about what Heather and I are saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:24.660" style="s2">about sex and relationships and stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.470" end="01:20:27.210" style="s2">that on the one hand there are some</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.660" end="01:20:29.070" style="s2">traditional aspects that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.210" end="01:20:30.810" style="s2">throwing away too easily the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.070" end="01:20:33.990" style="s2">our relationship isn&#39;t traditional at</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.810" end="01:20:36.540" style="s2">all it&#39;s really symmetrical right right</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.990" end="01:20:39.720" style="s2">she&#39;s very much the woman I&#39;m very much</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.540" end="01:20:42.240" style="s2">the man but you know we play similar</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.720" end="01:20:44.880" style="s2">roles in the world so anyway there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.240" end="01:20:49.230" style="s2">lot of room to Reena Gate stuff for</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.880" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">modern realities but Heather was a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.230" end="01:20:54.630" style="s2">tomboy she also feels that she would</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:21:00.030" style="s2">have been pushed towards trans in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.630" end="01:21:00.840" style="s2">modern era and the fact is you&#39;re gay</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.030" end="01:21:03.720" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.840" end="01:21:06.150" style="s2">she&#39;s not gay right I don&#39;t think either</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.720" end="01:21:07.350" style="s2">if you were born in the wrong body no</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.150" end="01:21:09.510" style="s2">right you&#39;ve both reached this</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.350" end="01:21:12.540" style="s2">conclusion now is body still function</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.510" end="01:21:17.310" style="s2">clear-headed adults say and so the point</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.540" end="01:21:19.530" style="s2">is there is this it&#39;s it&#39;s knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.310" end="01:21:22.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this knee-jerk thing over on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.530" end="01:21:24.930" style="s2">authoritarian left where it&#39;s like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.170" end="01:21:27.930" style="s2">got a litmus test right if you do not</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.930" end="01:21:30.780" style="s2">subscribe to this thing then it is</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.930" end="01:21:34.650" style="s2">because of this motive right and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.780" end="01:21:36.650" style="s2">anybody who resists anything trans is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.650" end="01:21:40.790" style="s2">trans folk right right</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.650" end="01:21:43.740" style="s2">the problem is trans is in tension</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.790" end="01:21:45.180" style="s2">therefore with gay and with straight</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.740" end="01:21:49.910" style="s2">tomboy yes right</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.180" end="01:21:52.410" style="s2">so the problem is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.910" end="01:21:54.770" style="s2">historically oppressed people in three</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.410" end="01:21:58.770" style="s2">different categories whose interests are</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.770" end="01:22:00.840" style="s2">yeah right there has to be an adult</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.770" end="01:22:04.949" style="s2">solution to this where we acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.840" end="01:22:07.110" style="s2">there are trans people not everybody who</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.949" end="01:22:10.500" style="s2">presents in some non-standard way is</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.110" end="01:22:12.870" style="s2">trans there&#39;s you know as you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.500" end="01:22:15.300" style="s2">variation right right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.870" end="01:22:17.730" style="s2">complex scenario with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.300" end="01:22:21.179" style="s2">different dip switches and we get every</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.730" end="01:22:24.410" style="s2">combination right and all of them as far</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.179" end="01:22:28.400" style="s2">as I know all of them are valid but a</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.410" end="01:22:31.830" style="s2">simple-minded rubric that forces people</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.400" end="01:22:34.380" style="s2">and are you following a natalie win</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.830" end="01:22:37.500" style="s2">doctor points yeah she&#39;s not a fan of</p>

<p begin="01:28:06.910" end="01:28:15.700" style="s2">of hope that she will I would say to her</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.620" end="01:28:17.650" style="s2">that I think she is badly misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.700" end="01:28:19.930" style="s2">by the world and she is not doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.650" end="01:28:22.810" style="s2">herself any favors by burning people</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.930" end="01:28:25.600" style="s2">like you and me and Jesse single who</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.810" end="01:28:27.430" style="s2">actually do appreciate what she&#39;s up to</p>

<p begin="01:28:27.430" end="01:28:30.850" style="s2">of my interest in her is because she</p>

<p begin="01:28:30.850" end="01:28:36.010" style="s2">work you know she&#39;s really lifted up</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.910" end="01:28:39.370" style="s2">viewed as a hero by this group that also</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.010" end="01:28:42.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to get her or even liked</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.370" end="01:28:43.900" style="s2">her when she when she steps out of line</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.220" end="01:28:45.790" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s the interesting two</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.900" end="01:28:47.770" style="s2">position at the end because it can be so</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.790" end="01:28:50.500" style="s2">transformative yeah but you have people</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.770" end="01:28:53.800" style="s2">like I you know I I think Lena Dunham is</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.500" end="01:28:55.570" style="s2">in this category someone who is hated</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.800" end="01:28:58.270" style="s2">for lots of reasons some of them legit</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.570" end="01:29:01.050" style="s2">some of them not but instead of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.270" end="01:29:03.760" style="s2">using absorbing that criticism</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.050" end="01:29:06.100" style="s2">transforming it and becoming a more</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.760" end="01:29:07.810" style="s2">empathetic person a more tolerant person</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.100" end="01:29:10.090" style="s2">a more open-minded person I&#39;m a person</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.810" end="01:29:12.010" style="s2">we&#39;re willing to cross these arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.090" end="01:29:14.080" style="s2">ideological lines what she does instead</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.010" end="01:29:16.270" style="s2">is become a bully that&#39;s what I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.080" end="01:29:17.530" style="s2">stand when you are when you have gone</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.270" end="01:29:18.520" style="s2">through something that like you&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.530" end="01:29:20.590" style="s2">through where I&#39;ve gone through or</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.520" end="01:29:22.810" style="s2">anybody&#39;s gone through and and it just</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.590" end="01:29:24.160" style="s2">hardens you and cuz it you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.810" end="01:29:25.090" style="s2">about Lena Dunham Lena Dunham I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.160" end="01:29:26.500" style="s2">talking about I think no I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.090" end="01:29:27.280" style="s2">Natalie&#39;s in the position now where she</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.500" end="01:29:29.110" style="s2">could go either way</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.280" end="01:29:30.910" style="s2">yeah if she wants to maintain the</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.110" end="01:29:33.610" style="s2">audience who has supported her until now</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.910" end="01:29:36.730" style="s2">most of which are lots of about trans</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.610" end="01:29:38.290" style="s2">folks and their allies well she&#39;s got a</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.730" end="01:29:41.200" style="s2">choice to make you know if she can be</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.290" end="01:29:43.270" style="s2">she can capture keep that audience or</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.200" end="01:29:46.450" style="s2">capture anyone well I think the problem</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.270" end="01:29:50.500" style="s2">is she is doing two vital things if I</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.450" end="01:29:54.160" style="s2">understand what I see correctly one</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.500" end="01:29:56.590" style="s2">thing that she is doing is she is in</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.160" end="01:30:00.940" style="s2">excruciating detail</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.590" end="01:30:03.100" style="s2">allowing people to participate in her</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.940" end="01:30:05.140" style="s2">transition to sort of understand how she</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.100" end="01:30:07.720" style="s2">thinks about it her own you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.140" end="01:30:10.420" style="s2">internal conflicts I mean it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.720" end="01:30:12.850" style="s2">what she&#39;s actually put on video and let</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.420" end="01:30:17.070" style="s2">us hear you know it&#39;s like hearing her</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.850" end="01:30:20.530" style="s2">internal monologue as she&#39;s on this very</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.070" end="01:30:21.700" style="s2">difficult journey right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.530" end="01:30:24.670" style="s2">interesting if you care at all about</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.700" end="01:30:26.680" style="s2">this trans thing it&#39;s not like what</p>

<p begin="01:30:34.570" end="01:30:41.410" style="s2">nothing to do with trans at all which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.970" end="01:30:45.070" style="s2">she is a very insightful person who has</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.410" end="01:30:47.650" style="s2">a unique capacity to teleport herself</p>

<p begin="01:30:51.370" end="01:30:58.780" style="s2">her work she does these very elaborate</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.180" end="01:30:59.409" style="s2">very visually provocative videos in</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.780" end="01:31:02.110" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.409" end="01:31:06.699" style="s2">plays all of the characters and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.110" end="01:31:08.619" style="s2">characters give voice to lots of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.699" end="01:31:10.389" style="s2">including you know she&#39;s got an all</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.619" end="01:31:13.090" style="s2">right character she&#39;s got an</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.389" end="01:31:17.159" style="s2">authoritarian left character right she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.090" end="01:31:20.729" style="s2">got all of these entities and she is</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.159" end="01:31:24.369" style="s2">simultaneously lampooning them but also</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.729" end="01:31:27.789" style="s2">giving voice to their best arguments</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.369" end="01:31:30.280" style="s2">which if you haven&#39;t seen it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.789" end="01:31:33.010" style="s2">definitely worth paying attention to</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.280" end="01:31:35.199" style="s2">because it does for me at least it</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.010" end="01:31:40.840" style="s2">provides insight into how these people</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.199" end="01:31:42.489" style="s2">view themselves in a very very visually</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.840" end="01:31:44.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to say compelling because</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.489" end="01:31:46.059" style="s2">some people will find it repellent</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.530" end="01:31:49.659" style="s2">mm-hmm and other people find it</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.059" end="01:31:52.059" style="s2">compelling but doing it in a way that it</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.659" end="01:31:54.280" style="s2">holds your attention and it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.059" end="01:31:55.959" style="s2">to dismiss it she&#39;s almost you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.280" end="01:31:57.729" style="s2">there&#39;s the criticism that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.959" end="01:31:59.320" style="s2">gets who sort of in our position like I</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.729" end="01:32:01.929" style="s2">think Dave Rubin probably gets more than</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.320" end="01:32:03.760" style="s2">anybody that you know there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.929" end="01:32:05.800" style="s2">guilt by association and if you engage</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.760" end="01:32:07.119" style="s2">with anybody who has these ideas whether</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.800" end="01:32:09.519" style="s2">it&#39;s Candice Onan Owens for Mike&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.119" end="01:32:13.360" style="s2">tournament or whoever you know the</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.519" end="01:32:15.219" style="s2">goalposts always moves that your</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.360" end="01:32:16.840" style="s2">platforming this person and that is bad</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.219" end="01:32:19.090" style="s2">and you can&#39;t do that well what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.840" end="01:32:20.800" style="s2">doing is it&#39;s sort of exactly that but</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.090" end="01:32:22.989" style="s2">without that without the added</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.800" end="01:32:24.939" style="s2">controversy of the person you mean by</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.989" end="01:32:26.409" style="s2">using these characters right by voicing</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.939" end="01:32:28.239" style="s2">the characters instead of having Candice</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.409" end="01:32:30.219" style="s2">Owens on the show she can do Candice</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.239" end="01:32:32.530" style="s2">Owens which really I think saves her</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.219" end="01:32:34.449" style="s2">sort of a lot of grief in some ways it</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.530" end="01:32:36.669" style="s2">also is visually just really stunning</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.449" end="01:32:37.209" style="s2">it&#39;s really stunning it&#39;s really well</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.669" end="01:32:39.010" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.209" end="01:32:40.919" style="s2">yeah and she&#39;s multi-talented I mean she</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.010" end="01:32:44.260" style="s2">was a I think she bailed out of</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.919" end="01:32:45.849" style="s2">philosophy a PhD he said and bailed out</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.260" end="01:32:47.019" style="s2">because she couldn&#39;t stand it you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.849" end="01:32:48.309" style="s2">not because she couldn&#39;t hack it he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.019" end="01:32:49.959" style="s2">literally very good at what she does</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.309" end="01:32:51.249" style="s2">yeah as a filmmaker I mean I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.959" end="01:32:52.780" style="s2">if she has any training as a filmmaker</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.249" end="01:32:55.179" style="s2">but I think she does everything sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.780" end="01:32:59.050" style="s2">one camera very few people helping her</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.179" end="01:33:01.989" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it is it&#39;s really remarkable</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.050" end="01:33:03.219" style="s2">she&#39;s also a musician right but she then</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.989" end="01:33:04.449" style="s2">you know someone like Christina Hoff</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.219" end="01:33:05.919" style="s2">Sommers will say something like if</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.449" end="01:33:08.079" style="s2">Christina seems like a big fan of</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.919" end="01:33:10.659" style="s2">Natalie you know and the response of</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.079" end="01:33:13.429" style="s2">that is like from her fans just get your</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.659" end="01:33:18.020" style="s2">get her name out of your mouth</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.429" end="01:33:19.610" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so anyway I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.020" end="01:33:22.219" style="s2">she&#39;s in a very frightening position in</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.610" end="01:33:27.320" style="s2">which there is a good move but because</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.219" end="01:33:29.719" style="s2">the the KE shift that would occur she</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.320" end="01:33:30.949" style="s2">made the move would be massive it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.719" end="01:33:33.920" style="s2">to be very frightening from her</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.949" end="01:33:37.280" style="s2">perspective sure if she embraced the</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.920" end="01:33:39.739" style="s2">wider world people who find value in</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.280" end="01:33:46.179" style="s2">what she&#39;s doing even beyond the trans</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.739" end="01:33:49.460" style="s2">stuff she would lose a bunch of her most</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.179" end="01:33:52.880" style="s2">authoritarian radical transfer fanbase</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.460" end="01:33:55.850" style="s2">right and she would gain I think she</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.880" end="01:33:58.489" style="s2">would gain a world of people outside and</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.850" end="01:34:02.239" style="s2">in effect I think she would do a</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.489" end="01:34:05.840" style="s2">tremendous service for trans because her</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.239" end="01:34:09.280" style="s2">value her primary value is that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.840" end="01:34:13.310" style="s2">insightful the fact of a trans person</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.280" end="01:34:16.840" style="s2">who is wildly insightful and can enter</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.310" end="01:34:20.570" style="s2">into this landscape of new political</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.840" end="01:34:22.610" style="s2">entities and you know understand them</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.570" end="01:34:24.710" style="s2">well enough to do a play in which she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.610" end="01:34:27.739" style="s2">doing all the parts that person has a</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.710" end="01:34:30.380" style="s2">unique contribution to make and so for</p>

<p begin="01:36:14.000" end="01:36:18.889" style="s2">epidemic of trans homicides right the</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.579" end="01:36:20.719" style="s2">epidemic is 20 people yeah this is not</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.889" end="01:36:22.460" style="s2">an epidemic this isn&#39;t even higher this</p>

<p begin="01:38:44.429" end="01:38:48.449" style="s2">really at the forefront of things like</p>

<p begin="01:42:10.860" end="01:42:18.780" style="s2">confusion yes at the moment and I wonder</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.909" end="01:42:21.449" style="s2">I wonder what its Genesis really is</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.780" end="01:42:23.219" style="s2">well this to me it seems cyclical you</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.449" end="01:42:25.280" style="s2">know this is not the first time and it</p>

<p begin="01:42:31.290" end="01:42:38.610" style="s2">which with actual witch hunts with the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.830" end="01:42:40.800" style="s2">satanic panic you know it we take ideas</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.610" end="01:42:41.969" style="s2">and we spread them and now we have the</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.800" end="01:42:46.010" style="s2">internet so we don&#39;t even have to do it</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.969" end="01:42:49.440" style="s2">in person yes although I also think</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.010" end="01:42:50.849" style="s2">there is something to be said for you</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.440" end="01:42:54.030" style="s2">know and I don&#39;t know how far back this</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.849" end="01:42:55.860" style="s2">goes the Internet is the maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.030" end="01:42:59.580" style="s2">version of this with the least viscosity</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.860" end="01:43:02.219" style="s2">but these new modes of communicating are</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.580" end="01:43:05.699" style="s2">not anticipated by our evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.219" end="01:43:10.969" style="s2">wiring and they result in positive</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.699" end="01:43:15.270" style="s2">feedbacks so you know as Douglas Murray</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.969" end="01:43:17.849" style="s2">points out suddenly we&#39;ve forgotten many</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.270" end="01:43:19.739" style="s2">things that we fully understood</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.849" end="01:43:21.060" style="s2">yesterday like the difference a tree or</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.739" end="01:43:22.139" style="s2">the fact that male and female are</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.060" end="01:43:26.159" style="s2">distinct categories through any other</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.139" end="01:43:28.679" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah right like a were you</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.159" end="01:43:31.020" style="s2">to discover that male and female were</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.679" end="01:43:33.179" style="s2">not real categories you would certainly</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.020" end="01:43:36.449" style="s2">imagine a long period of transition</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.179" end="01:43:38.159" style="s2">figuring out what that meant not only</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.449" end="01:43:41.280" style="s2">have we not actually discovered anything</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.159" end="01:43:43.170" style="s2">of the sort but you are imagined to have</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.280" end="01:43:45.780" style="s2">instantly come around to the new wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.170" end="01:43:47.520" style="s2">right right universe does that even</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.780" end="01:43:50.330" style="s2">happen all right</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.520" end="01:43:52.409" style="s2">yeah so anyway all I&#39;m getting at is</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.330" end="01:43:54.000" style="s2">there is a clearly a ghost in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.409" end="01:43:57.239" style="s2">machine right that ghost in the machine</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.000" end="01:44:00.000" style="s2">may have been what scheduled network</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.239" end="01:44:01.500" style="s2">television for decades and that now that</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.000" end="01:44:06.330" style="s2">goes to the Machine is the algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.500" end="01:44:08.969" style="s2">that control certain feed because they</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.330" end="01:44:11.580" style="s2">are shaping conversations in ways we</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.969" end="01:44:13.440" style="s2">don&#39;t understand but to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.580" end="01:44:15.599" style="s2">as you point out people who believe in</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.440" end="01:44:17.040" style="s2">climate change are also you know have</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.599" end="01:44:19.489" style="s2">renewed interest in tarot cards or</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.040" end="01:44:19.489" style="s2">whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.710" end="01:44:25.380" style="s2">the whole thing is evidence of not</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.880" end="01:44:28.050" style="s2">having any idea what the to believe</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.380" end="01:44:29.489" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.050" end="01:44:31.080" style="s2">that I mean I think is sort of man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.489" end="01:44:33.210" style="s2">eternal quest for meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.080" end="01:44:34.920" style="s2">explanation and I also think part of it</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.210" end="01:44:36.840" style="s2">is just straight-up viral it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.920" end="01:44:39.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a unit you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.840" end="01:44:41.790" style="s2">a it&#39;s a meme and the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.510" end="01:44:44.580" style="s2">golden doodles were more popular than</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.790" end="01:44:46.650" style="s2">they were 20 years ago or babies names</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.580" end="01:44:48.840" style="s2">or whatever the fact that you know I can</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.650" end="01:44:52.440" style="s2">go to the dog park now and every child</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.840" end="01:44:54.870" style="s2">is named like kale and sunny and every</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.440" end="01:44:56.520" style="s2">dog is named George and Frank like part</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.870" end="01:45:00.000" style="s2">of this to me also just seems like just</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.520" end="01:45:02.489" style="s2">the absolute nature of human connection</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.000" end="01:45:05.010" style="s2">which is taking one idea and passing it</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.489" end="01:45:07.710" style="s2">on okay which raises maybe the most</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.010" end="01:45:13.500" style="s2">important question for people like you</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.710" end="01:45:14.790" style="s2">and me it is after World War Two there</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.500" end="01:45:17.100" style="s2">was a period of time in which social</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.790" end="01:45:19.909" style="s2">science was actually pretty productive</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.100" end="01:45:24.900" style="s2">and it was focused on the question of</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.909" end="01:45:27.960" style="s2">how the Nazis happen mm-hmm how the</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.900" end="01:45:29.909" style="s2">Holocaust had occurred and the Milgram</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.960" end="01:45:31.800" style="s2">experiment in particular which was run</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.909" end="01:45:33.929" style="s2">many different ways ultimately has this</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.800" end="01:45:35.610" style="s2">been has Milgram yet been uh has been</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.929" end="01:45:37.920" style="s2">hit by the replication crisis yet or do</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.610" end="01:45:39.960" style="s2">we still trust this one I still trust</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.920" end="01:45:42.480" style="s2">this what I frankly even if it were hit</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.960" end="01:45:44.250" style="s2">by the rock you still trust it I believe</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.480" end="01:45:46.620" style="s2">I know it to be true that through</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.250" end="01:45:50.120" style="s2">personal experience having seen you say</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.620" end="01:45:53.550" style="s2">that yeah I&#39;m a foal so anyway I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.120" end="01:45:56.310" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ll have a green version of Lord</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.550" end="01:46:00.650" style="s2">of the Flies great experiment yeah all</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.310" end="01:46:04.560" style="s2">that stuff 1984 yeah but anyway the</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.650" end="01:46:09.360" style="s2">there is something to the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.560" end="01:46:11.730" style="s2">vast majority of people are wired such</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.360" end="01:46:15.179" style="s2">that they do not have the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.730" end="01:46:17.670" style="s2">refuse certain kinds of authority sure</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.179" end="01:46:22.080" style="s2">and some of us aren&#39;t wired this way at</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.670" end="01:46:25.530" style="s2">all okay right I&#39;m in it so the kids</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.080" end="01:46:27.540" style="s2">with the authority issues turn out not</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.530" end="01:46:30.600" style="s2">to be so easily persuaded by some of</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.540" end="01:46:32.500" style="s2">this new received wisdom right right now</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.600" end="01:46:35.590" style="s2">there are errors I&#39;m convinced</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.500" end="01:46:37.930" style="s2">that there are eras in which those kids</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.590" end="01:46:41.680" style="s2">with the authority issues that is people</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.930" end="01:46:44.370" style="s2">like you and me are out of place mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.680" end="01:46:47.230" style="s2">right that&#39;s not the job of the moment</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.370" end="01:46:49.030" style="s2">their job is to go along right right it</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.230" end="01:46:53.620" style="s2">needs doing right and then there are</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.030" end="01:46:55.360" style="s2">other moments when those are the only</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.620" end="01:46:58.150" style="s2">people who can think straight because</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.360" end="01:47:00.010" style="s2">there&#39;s so much of this steering going</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.150" end="01:47:02.020" style="s2">on through these other mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.010" end="01:47:05.080" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s at all susceptible to it</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.020" end="01:47:09.550" style="s2">is persuaded of wrong stuff and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.080" end="01:47:11.350" style="s2">know I joke sometimes that zombie movies</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.550" end="01:47:13.210" style="s2">are really about preparing people for</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.350" end="01:47:16.390" style="s2">what their neighbors look like when</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.210" end="01:47:18.490" style="s2">they&#39;re starving yeah you know it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.390" end="01:47:21.100" style="s2">but it&#39;s also I you know I do sort of</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.490" end="01:47:23.860" style="s2">have the sense of like there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.100" end="01:47:27.100" style="s2">a zombie movie unfolding around us and</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.860" end="01:47:29.710" style="s2">it has to do with bad software programs</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.100" end="01:47:32.620" style="s2">that are spreading virally and causing</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.710" end="01:47:34.060" style="s2">people to embrace stuff that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.620" end="01:47:38.170" style="s2">conscious mind should know better than</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.060" end="01:47:41.140" style="s2">but internally their fears allow them to</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.170" end="01:47:44.860" style="s2">be captured all right so I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.140" end="01:47:50.010" style="s2">question is from one kid with an</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.860" end="01:47:54.060" style="s2">authority issue to another what do we do</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.010" end="01:47:56.290" style="s2">that&#39;s the question I mean I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.060" end="01:47:57.340" style="s2">there&#39;s another problem here right which</p>
<p begin="01:47:56.290" end="01:47:58.960" style="s2">is like all right so you have people</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.340" end="01:48:00.910" style="s2">without people like us the kids with the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.960" end="01:48:02.980" style="s2">authority issues I think Allen Trager</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.910" end="01:48:07.240" style="s2">would probably say the galilean you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.980" end="01:48:08.980" style="s2">personality types so let&#39;s take Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.240" end="01:48:10.030" style="s2">Peterson for example I recently saw the</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.980" end="01:48:12.040" style="s2">you know this Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.030" end="01:48:14.860" style="s2">documentary the riots of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.040" end="01:48:16.180" style="s2">that is pissed some people off who</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.860" end="01:48:19.300" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen the movies been cancelled</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.180" end="01:48:21.070" style="s2">in various venues when it was being shot</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.300" end="01:48:23.770" style="s2">in Portland you know and Tifa threatened</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.070" end="01:48:24.940" style="s2">to bring out the guillotine and in</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.770" end="01:48:26.440" style="s2">response to this movie that was being</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.940" end="01:48:27.670" style="s2">shown at a church in the suburbs because</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.440" end="01:48:30.430" style="s2">they don&#39;t go they don&#39;t go out to the</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.670" end="01:48:31.570" style="s2">suburbs you know and and so as I was</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.430" end="01:48:32.620" style="s2">watching this I mean I&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.570" end="01:48:34.810" style="s2">sort of one of those people who thought</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.620" end="01:48:38.200" style="s2">that the the reaction to Peterson is</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.810" end="01:48:39.760" style="s2">outsized it&#39;s the criticism of him is</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.200" end="01:48:42.070" style="s2">counterproductive if the goal is to shut</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.760" end="01:48:44.620" style="s2">him down and that he&#39;s not dangerous and</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.070" end="01:48:46.199" style="s2">that&#39;s his message is one of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.620" end="01:48:50.170" style="s2">basic common sense</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.199" end="01:48:51.730" style="s2">independence you know OMA conservative</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.170" end="01:48:53.920" style="s2">values in some way sort of small C</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.730" end="01:48:55.300" style="s2">conservative values you know take care</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.920" end="01:48:57.040" style="s2">of yourself to carry your family</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.300" end="01:48:59.260" style="s2">so nothing inherently problematic there</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.040" end="01:49:00.489" style="s2">but I watched this movie and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.260" end="01:49:03.610" style="s2">defended him you know I&#39;ve said he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.489" end="01:49:05.409" style="s2">a Nazi he&#39;s not it he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.610" end="01:49:07.570" style="s2">not a threat to the Republic if your</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.409" end="01:49:09.130" style="s2">child is watching Jordan Peterson videos</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.570" end="01:49:10.630" style="s2">on YouTube don&#39;t write an article about</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.130" end="01:49:12.310" style="s2">it in the New York Times talking</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.630" end="01:49:14.170" style="s2">about your kid being alright like this</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.310" end="01:49:15.730" style="s2">is not this is not a step to the all</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.170" end="01:49:17.409" style="s2">right if anything is to step away from</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.730" end="01:49:18.969" style="s2">it but watching this film this</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.409" end="01:49:22.300" style="s2">documentary and you know I&#39;ve spoken to</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.969" end="01:49:24.070" style="s2">a lot of his his followers I do see the</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.300" end="01:49:26.530" style="s2">danger there for the first time and the</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.070" end="01:49:28.690" style="s2">danger is in the adulation right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.530" end="01:49:30.460" style="s2">the fact that yet Peterson might have</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.690" end="01:49:32.199" style="s2">good motives and he might be highly</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.460" end="01:49:34.449" style="s2">attuned to the fact that what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.199" end="01:49:35.949" style="s2">trying to do is resist authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.449" end="01:49:38.290" style="s2">he&#39;s been obsessed with this his whole</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.949" end="01:49:41.080" style="s2">life but his followers or his followers</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.290" end="01:49:42.820" style="s2">right and so even if the message is one</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.080" end="01:49:44.290" style="s2">of independence and of thinking for</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.820" end="01:49:46.929" style="s2">yourself and not following along with</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.290" end="01:49:48.909" style="s2">the crowd most people are gonna follow</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.929" end="01:49:50.679" style="s2">along with the crowd and so I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.909" end="01:49:53.520" style="s2">so if even if you&#39;re telling people</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.679" end="01:49:55.960" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to me think for yourself I</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.520" end="01:49:57.489" style="s2">don&#39;t think you can do that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.960" end="01:50:01.239" style="s2">what they&#39;re gonna do it&#39;s just a sort</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.489" end="01:50:04.900" style="s2">of fandom well I think you that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.239" end="01:50:07.420" style="s2">perfect response actually and for my</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.900" end="01:50:13.320" style="s2">listeners who don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.420" end="01:50:15.370" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was in Seattle and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.320" end="01:50:17.050" style="s2">called you up and was like do you want</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.370" end="01:50:18.250" style="s2">to go yeah when I went yeah thing</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.050" end="01:50:22.030" style="s2">together and then you wrote an article</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.250" end="01:50:23.860" style="s2">about it which was in some ways I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.030" end="01:50:28.360" style="s2">it was a tough article you were you were</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.860" end="01:50:31.570" style="s2">not easy on him but I thought it was a</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.360" end="01:50:33.280" style="s2">very decent article in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.570" end="01:50:40.210" style="s2">what she said if I remember it correctly</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.280" end="01:50:42.159" style="s2">is I Katie Hertzog don&#39;t need Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.210" end="01:50:45.940" style="s2">right Orson my real clean I don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.159" end="01:50:48.219" style="s2">my room is clean that&#39;s good but he is</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.940" end="01:50:51.100" style="s2">not what he is being portrayed right not</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.219" end="01:50:55.090" style="s2">funny he&#39;s a deprecating he&#39;s decent etc</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.100" end="01:50:56.590" style="s2">yeah and I think that this is a message</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.090" end="01:50:58.090" style="s2">a lot of people needed to hear and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.590" end="01:50:58.969" style="s2">wish that that piece had gotten wider</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.090" end="01:51:04.430" style="s2">circulation</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.969" end="01:51:07.040" style="s2">but you&#39;re exactly right about Jordan is</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.430" end="01:51:09.980" style="s2">a decent guy right a lot of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.040" end="01:51:12.260" style="s2">saying is common sense and the part</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.980" end="01:51:14.810" style="s2">that&#39;s not common sense is carefully</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.260" end="01:51:17.360" style="s2">thought out and it is about decency</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.810" end="01:51:19.219" style="s2">right that&#39;s like a core mission of his</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.360" end="01:51:21.250" style="s2">I&#39;m convinced of that as somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.219" end="01:51:26.380" style="s2">knows him pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.250" end="01:51:29.210" style="s2">the followers if Jordan were a bad guy</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.380" end="01:51:31.520" style="s2">we&#39;d be in big trouble that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.210" end="01:51:34.640" style="s2">exactly yeah thank goodness he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.520" end="01:51:36.890" style="s2">right right right and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.640" end="01:51:40.280" style="s2">happens if something happens to him and</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.890" end="01:51:44.330" style="s2">that movement is captured right but for</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.280" end="01:51:46.130" style="s2">the moment let us not freak out and let</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.330" end="01:51:48.469" style="s2">us say actually thank goodness that</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.130" end="01:51:50.510" style="s2">somebody you know I do think he&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.469" end="01:51:51.860" style="s2">backwards looking mm-hmm all right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.510" end="01:51:55.580" style="s2">looking for us to go back to a place</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.860" end="01:51:57.890" style="s2">that we can&#39;t go back to right but the</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.580" end="01:52:00.710" style="s2">point is pay attention to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.890" end="01:52:03.140" style="s2">doing you&#39;re hurting yourself stop it</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.710" end="01:52:04.820" style="s2">and it clearly works at an individual</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.140" end="01:52:06.560" style="s2">level absolutely lots of people are</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.820" end="01:52:08.410" style="s2">getting a lot of benefit from it and it</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.560" end="01:52:11.440" style="s2">is the alternative to one of these</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.410" end="01:52:15.739" style="s2">corrosive destructive not what they say</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.440" end="01:52:17.680" style="s2">movements so so I believe the caution is</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.739" end="01:52:19.810" style="s2">exactly the right one</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.680" end="01:52:22.489" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing frightening about</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.810" end="01:52:25.430" style="s2">Peterson but there is something</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.489" end="01:52:27.980" style="s2">frightening about if he was not what he</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.430" end="01:52:29.690" style="s2">appeared to be what that moved right and</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.980" end="01:52:31.640" style="s2">you can say that about anybody you can</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.690" end="01:52:33.440" style="s2">say that about Roxane gay you can say</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.640" end="01:52:35.570" style="s2">that about anybody I mean this really</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.440" end="01:52:37.310" style="s2">it&#39;s just the nature of fandom but I</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.570" end="01:52:39.530" style="s2">think that&#39;s the problem is like you</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.310" end="01:52:40.489" style="s2">have people like us who maybe are a</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.530" end="01:52:44.000" style="s2">little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.489" end="01:52:46.670" style="s2">I don&#39;t know resistant to the call of</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.000" end="01:52:48.920" style="s2">authority but most people aren&#39;t like us</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.670" end="01:52:50.420" style="s2">Yeah right so we can you and I can get a</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.920" end="01:52:51.860" style="s2">big following and sort of preach our</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.420" end="01:52:54.350" style="s2">values to these people and maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.860" end="01:52:55.850" style="s2">would listen to us and and uphold what</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.350" end="01:52:57.800" style="s2">we think are you know the correct</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.850" end="01:53:00.830" style="s2">classical liberal values tolerance</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.800" end="01:53:02.600" style="s2">diversity of thought but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.830" end="01:53:03.949" style="s2">mean that people are going to absorb the</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.600" end="01:53:05.840" style="s2">wider message or if they&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.949" end="01:53:08.030" style="s2">to be following along and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:53:05.840" end="01:53:10.580" style="s2">an answer to that I mean I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.030" end="01:53:12.800" style="s2">what Peterson is trying to do is to</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.580" end="01:53:16.420" style="s2">teach people to resist a call of the</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.800" end="01:53:19.240" style="s2">right Arianism and groupthink yeah but I</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.420" end="01:53:21.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know how it works I mean you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.240" end="01:53:23.210" style="s2">Orwell was writing about this in the 40s</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.680" end="01:53:25.910" style="s2">people were writing about it before then</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.210" end="01:53:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s the conundrum</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.910" end="01:53:30.110" style="s2">I dunno though after going through all</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.440" end="01:53:31.580" style="s2">of this what I do know is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.110" end="01:53:32.840" style="s2">when I was a kid and you know we studied</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.580" end="01:53:34.880" style="s2">the Holocaust in schools and I would</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.840" end="01:53:37.070" style="s2">think like you know of course I would be</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.880" end="01:53:41.270" style="s2">the one to resist the Nazis absolutely I</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.070" end="01:53:42.800" style="s2">know that now yep I think she did I know</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.270" end="01:53:44.360" style="s2">that too yeah which is ironic because</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.800" end="01:53:45.200" style="s2">I&#39;m called a Nazi all the time all the</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.360" end="01:53:47.000" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.200" end="01:53:49.610" style="s2">yeah the irony&#39;s never stopped at the</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.000" end="01:53:52.130" style="s2">authoritarian laughter I agree yeah what</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.610" end="01:53:54.410" style="s2">I think needs to be said is it you know</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.130" end="01:53:56.870" style="s2">it feels very good to know what you</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.410" end="01:53:59.990" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be a collaborator the problem</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.870" end="01:54:01.880" style="s2">is we would very probably be dead</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.990" end="01:54:03.440" style="s2">because of that right right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.880" end="01:54:05.690" style="s2">like it works out in the end</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.440" end="01:54:07.940" style="s2">as you would resist there were there was</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.690" end="01:54:11.660" style="s2">a resistance there was a resistance and</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.940" end="01:54:13.430" style="s2">there were uprising right and look you</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.660" end="01:54:16.100" style="s2">know and they were free there were hate</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.430" end="01:54:20.000" style="s2">speech laws I didn&#39;t stop the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.100" end="01:54:24.430" style="s2">from happening absolutely I think though</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.000" end="01:54:24.430" style="s2">there there is a kind of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.960" end="01:54:32.200" style="s2">subtext to all of this that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.170" end="01:54:34.490" style="s2">think has been well explored yet and</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.200" end="01:54:37.280" style="s2">holds the answer to what you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.490" end="01:54:43.940" style="s2">at and what it has to do with is the</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.280" end="01:54:46.010" style="s2">fact that people in general are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.940" end="01:54:47.360" style="s2">prone to herd-like behavior and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.010" end="01:54:51.470" style="s2">very frightening because it does end up</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.360" end="01:54:53.390" style="s2">in things like the Holocaust they also</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.470" end="01:54:55.550" style="s2">have another mode though I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.390" end="01:54:59.660" style="s2">absolutely everybody does but I think</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.550" end="01:55:01.130" style="s2">it&#39;s in everybody at some level even you</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.660" end="01:55:03.410" style="s2">know if it beat if it&#39;s dormant too long</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.130" end="01:55:07.460" style="s2">maybe it can&#39;t be awaken but the</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.410" end="01:55:11.420" style="s2">question really is how do we behave in</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.460" end="01:55:16.160" style="s2">such a way as to wake the part of people</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.420" end="01:55:18.080" style="s2">that actually will resist you know a</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.160" end="01:55:20.480" style="s2">Jordan Peterson who isn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.080" end="01:55:24.200" style="s2">intentioned right example right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.480" end="01:55:26.120" style="s2">a tough it&#39;s a tough problem because you</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.200" end="01:55:28.160" style="s2">know if you make that the message</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.120" end="01:55:30.650" style="s2">wake up and don&#39;t follow too easily you</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.160" end="01:55:32.660" style="s2">know it&#39;s Monty Python right you know</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.650" end="01:55:34.730" style="s2">right you don&#39;t have to follow anyone</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.660" end="01:55:36.680" style="s2">you are all individuals right we are all</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.730" end="01:55:38.360" style="s2">and Dustin doctrine ate them with the</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.680" end="01:55:42.950" style="s2">with the message that they are all</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.360" end="01:55:44.300" style="s2">individual right exactly but and you</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.950" end="01:55:47.240" style="s2">know there&#39;s another thing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.300" end="01:55:50.900" style="s2">how seriously to take it but for people</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.240" end="01:55:53.090" style="s2">in my generation the matrix had a</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.900" end="01:55:54.680" style="s2">special meaning and in fact I am kind of</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.090" end="01:55:56.300" style="s2">annoyed that red pill I have been stolen</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.680" end="01:55:58.070" style="s2">from us as a metaphor because it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.300" end="01:55:59.900" style="s2">of a necessary one and it has nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.070" end="01:56:03.560" style="s2">do with one side or the other</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.900" end="01:56:05.390" style="s2">politically but one of the things in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.560" end="01:56:06.920" style="s2">matrix is you&#39;re not supposed to wake</p>
<p begin="01:56:05.390" end="01:56:09.200" style="s2">people past a certain age they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.920" end="01:56:10.820" style="s2">handle it right now I don&#39;t know that a</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.200" end="01:56:16.130" style="s2">certain age is really what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.820" end="01:56:19.490" style="s2">about but there is a question about the</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.130" end="01:56:22.220" style="s2">ability to wake becomes more complex the</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.490" end="01:56:26.090" style="s2">more stuff that you have stacked upon a</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.220" end="01:56:28.850" style="s2">particular received set of wisdom and I</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.090" end="01:56:31.430" style="s2">do think that we should be trying to</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.850" end="01:56:34.730" style="s2">figure out how to wake people but I</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.430" end="01:56:36.530" style="s2">think we also need to be aware that that</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.730" end="01:56:39.950" style="s2">carries dangers that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.530" end="01:56:44.780" style="s2">because in general most people are you</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.950" end="01:56:47.900" style="s2">know not highly cognizant right right so</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.780" end="01:56:49.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what to do about it but but</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.900" end="01:56:52.040" style="s2">we are sort of stuck in that puzzle yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.910" end="01:56:53.510" style="s2">I think the more people who stand up</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.040" end="01:56:55.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a better position we&#39;ll be in but</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.510" end="01:57:00.260" style="s2">you know as you know it comes with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.820" end="01:57:03.350" style="s2">of personal costs it does that article</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.260" end="01:57:05.390" style="s2">that that came out of the New York Times</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.350" end="01:57:06.710" style="s2">that talked about this question actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.390" end="01:57:08.960" style="s2">do you want to say anything about that</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.710" end="01:57:10.250" style="s2">article um I don&#39;t have that much to say</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.960" end="01:57:11.870" style="s2">about it I mean there so this article</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.250" end="01:57:14.480" style="s2">for the listeners this article came out</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.870" end="01:57:16.610" style="s2">in the New York Times last week it was</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.480" end="01:57:18.740" style="s2">written by a guy named John McDermott I</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.610" end="01:57:20.450" style="s2">think it was called like those people we</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.740" end="01:57:22.250" style="s2">tried to cancel they&#39;re all hanging out</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.450" end="01:57:24.110" style="s2">together and I was in a Jesse single</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.250" end="01:57:27.080" style="s2">Dave Rubin christina hoff sommers I</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.110" end="01:57:30.440" style="s2">think maybe not Alice Trager sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.080" end="01:57:32.390" style="s2">people you know our tribe I suppose but</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.440" end="01:57:33.710" style="s2">the reality is like for one thing the</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.390" end="01:57:34.460" style="s2">headline is none of us are</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.710" end="01:57:38.150" style="s2">hanging out together</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.460" end="01:57:39.650" style="s2">I&#39;m the we tried to cancel the they put</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.150" end="01:57:41.390" style="s2">a lot of emphasis on that</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.650" end="01:57:44.000" style="s2">I thought that the piece was a little</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.390" end="01:57:46.220" style="s2">strange I thought it tried to fit a</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.000" end="01:57:48.890" style="s2">narrative that doesn&#39;t truly exist</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.220" end="01:57:51.200" style="s2">because the reality is there are tons of</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.890" end="01:57:52.940" style="s2">professional networks and having a</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.200" end="01:57:55.640" style="s2">common experience with someone does not</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.940" end="01:57:59.360" style="s2">make you best friends or anything like</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.640" end="01:58:01.880" style="s2">that but it is also true that you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.360" end="01:58:03.350" style="s2">when a when I see someone sort of going</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.880" end="01:58:05.450" style="s2">through the ringer on Twitter I do reach</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.350" end="01:58:09.500" style="s2">out to them not all not always but often</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.450" end="01:58:10.340" style="s2">yeah and offer a few words and I think</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.500" end="01:58:11.630" style="s2">it&#39;s true that there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.340" end="01:58:13.550" style="s2">something really transformative about it</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.630" end="01:58:15.140" style="s2">which other people spoke about but still</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.550" end="01:58:16.340" style="s2">the piece was a little bit weird there</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.140" end="01:58:18.770" style="s2">was like a line in it that said</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.340" end="01:58:20.360" style="s2">something like you know Katy Herzog is</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.770" end="01:58:22.550" style="s2">part of an emerging group of journalists</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.360" end="01:58:25.450" style="s2">thinkers public figures whatever who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.550" end="01:58:27.920" style="s2">been canceled for having bad</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.450" end="01:58:29.600" style="s2">conservative or offensive opinions</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.920" end="01:58:31.310" style="s2">yes which was your case it&#39;s all three</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.600" end="01:58:33.410" style="s2">oh yeah all three I only have that</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.310" end="01:58:36.050" style="s2">conservative or offensive opinions so</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.410" end="01:58:37.970" style="s2">that line was aggravating yeah because</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.050" end="01:58:39.770" style="s2">this idea that you know the only reason</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.970" end="01:58:43.670" style="s2">any of us have been through this because</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.770" end="01:58:46.100" style="s2">we were wrong as opposed to right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.670" end="01:58:48.950" style="s2">that&#39;s it seemingly had not occurred to</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.100" end="01:58:53.210" style="s2">their editors well I should say first of</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.950" end="01:58:55.400" style="s2">all McDermott reached out oh did he and</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.210" end="01:58:58.550" style="s2">to Eric oh I could have to Eric first</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.400" end="01:59:00.530" style="s2">actually and you know there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.550" end="01:59:03.770" style="s2">question yeah and they reach out is this</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.530" end="01:59:06.110" style="s2">one safe great and in this case we</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.770" end="01:59:09.320" style="s2">talked about it and decided no decided</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.110" end="01:59:11.120" style="s2">it was not safe yeah so my I had a lot</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.320" end="01:59:12.800" style="s2">of conversations in the back channel</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.120" end="01:59:15.140" style="s2">with other people he&#39;d approached we</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.800" end="01:59:17.560" style="s2">were all talking about that and after</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.140" end="01:59:20.120" style="s2">speaking with him my feeling was that I</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.560" end="01:59:21.890" style="s2">trusted him because he and I seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.120" end="01:59:23.900" style="s2">on the same page I don&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.890" end="01:59:25.130" style="s2">editors of the paper and I especially do</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.900" end="01:59:27.950" style="s2">not trust the editors of the Style</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.130" end="01:59:31.340" style="s2">section so that was my concern the whole</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.950" end="01:59:32.900" style="s2">time was that a red pen was going to get</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.340" end="01:59:35.570" style="s2">introduced and my photo was in the paper</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.900" end="01:59:38.390" style="s2">and I told I told John I said if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.570" end="01:59:40.100" style="s2">know if you if it is if it comes out</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.390" end="01:59:41.750" style="s2">that this is this paper this is going to</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.100" end="01:59:43.010" style="s2">make like paint us all is not these are</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.750" end="01:59:46.010" style="s2">members of the KKK</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.010" end="01:59:48.470" style="s2">I will revoke you know your might your</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.010" end="01:59:50.630" style="s2">permission to use my photo but the the</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.470" end="01:59:52.749" style="s2">idea of you know triggering all my</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.630" end="01:59:54.699" style="s2">girlfriends was too powerful so</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.749" end="01:59:56.559" style="s2">I just I could imagine someone who like</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.699" end="01:59:57.789" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t like me you know opening</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.559" end="02:00:00.249" style="s2">up the sunday New York Times and seeing</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.789" end="02:00:02.019" style="s2">the photo and I just could not resist my</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.249" end="02:00:03.969" style="s2">ego just got so cut and then I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.019" end="02:00:06.010" style="s2">like the picture anyway so it</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.969" end="02:00:08.110" style="s2">was a good pick oh thank you yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.010" end="02:00:12.940" style="s2">so I did want to say something about it</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.110" end="02:00:14.469" style="s2">is is that I think that there&#39;s a I got</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.940" end="02:00:16.780" style="s2">into a back-and-forth on Twitter about</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.469" end="02:00:18.869" style="s2">it and I said something which triggers</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.780" end="02:00:22.210" style="s2">people every time I say it which is</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.869" end="02:00:24.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a dangerous message in telling</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.210" end="02:00:26.050" style="s2">people that you know those who have been</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.820" end="02:00:28.449" style="s2">cancelled are actually hanging out</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.050" end="02:00:31.659" style="s2">together right it&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.449" end="02:00:33.969" style="s2">inducement to people right to stand up</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.659" end="02:00:37.090" style="s2">and the problem is I do want people to</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.969" end="02:00:38.949" style="s2">stand up whenever Green happened Heather</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.090" end="02:00:41.260" style="s2">and my point to our colleagues was you</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.949" end="02:00:44.289" style="s2">know if we all stand up they can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.260" end="02:00:46.300" style="s2">right and didn&#39;t happen one right one</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.289" end="02:00:51.999" style="s2">person and now he&#39;s the only person like</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.300" end="02:00:56.019" style="s2">you busy with now but but anyway my</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.999" end="02:00:58.590" style="s2">point is two things one we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.019" end="02:01:01.479" style="s2">how many people have been cancelled and</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.590" end="02:01:04.329" style="s2">never heard from totally right we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.479" end="02:01:06.070" style="s2">know how often that happens and so we</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.329" end="02:01:08.409" style="s2">have a survivor bias issue that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.070" end="02:01:09.760" style="s2">statistical term meaning that we see</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.409" end="02:01:11.710" style="s2">certain data points and we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.760" end="02:01:12.849" style="s2">others right right you know we see the</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.710" end="02:01:14.260" style="s2">fossils of creatures that were</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.849" end="02:01:15.729" style="s2">widespread we don&#39;t see the fossils of</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.260" end="02:01:20.019" style="s2">ones that never got to a large</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.729" end="02:01:22.929" style="s2">population size for example so if you</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.019" end="02:01:26.050" style="s2">interview the people who somebody tried</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.929" end="02:01:28.269" style="s2">to cancel and now they go to the</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.050" end="02:01:30.070" style="s2">heterodox Academy meetings and a podcast</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.269" end="02:01:31.840" style="s2">and have podcasts on things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.070" end="02:01:34.510" style="s2">liable to get a very wrong picture of</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.840" end="02:01:36.159" style="s2">this is only what kind of life you will</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.510" end="02:01:38.710" style="s2">lead on the other side and those of us</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.159" end="02:01:41.170" style="s2">who are in this position I believe has</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.710" end="02:01:43.479" style="s2">have a near sacred obligation to tell</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.170" end="02:01:46.179" style="s2">the truth to those who are contemplating</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.479" end="02:01:48.369" style="s2">what to do and yes I do want them to</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.179" end="02:01:50.139" style="s2">stand up but I do not want them to stand</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.369" end="02:01:51.610" style="s2">up on the basis that it is safe or</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.139" end="02:01:53.699" style="s2">glamorous on the other side because it</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.610" end="02:01:57.820" style="s2">might be but it probably won&#39;t be and</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.699" end="02:02:00.789" style="s2">what we need are people who are ready</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.820" end="02:02:02.019" style="s2">for life in the foxhole and if</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.789" end="02:02:03.699" style="s2">you&#39;re not ready for life in the</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.019" end="02:02:05.830" style="s2">foxhole you&#39;re a liability in the</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.699" end="02:02:08.410" style="s2">foxhole right so we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.830" end="02:02:10.510" style="s2">have that so anyway what I would say to</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.410" end="02:02:14.920" style="s2">those who are contemplating what message</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.510" end="02:02:17.140" style="s2">to broadcast about this don&#39;t downplay</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.920" end="02:02:18.970" style="s2">the dangers and don&#39;t take the</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.140" end="02:02:20.740" style="s2">responsibility for other people and say</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.970" end="02:02:22.570" style="s2">yes you should stand up telling if</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.740" end="02:02:26.250" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to be there for them</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.570" end="02:02:29.080" style="s2">when goes south yeah right so that</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.250" end="02:02:30.400" style="s2">when people do make this decision if</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.080" end="02:02:32.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve been honest with them when they</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.400" end="02:02:37.060" style="s2">even they do make the decision to stand</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.440" end="02:02:40.360" style="s2">up then eh they&#39;re taking responsibility</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.060" end="02:02:42.730" style="s2">for what happens and be they&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.360" end="02:02:45.190" style="s2">robust in the face of what comes back at</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.730" end="02:02:47.740" style="s2">them yeah the worst thing which I now</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.190" end="02:02:49.510" style="s2">see too regularly is somebody</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.740" end="02:02:51.640" style="s2">I&#39;ll make some effort in the direction</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.510" end="02:02:53.230" style="s2">of standing up something will come back</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.640" end="02:02:54.940" style="s2">at them and then they retreat and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.230" end="02:02:57.630" style="s2">like oh you&#39;re making things worse don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.940" end="02:03:00.940" style="s2">don&#39;t do that right I never apologize</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.630" end="02:03:02.740" style="s2">yeah in this particular case I apologize</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.940" end="02:03:05.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re you know yeah never</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.740" end="02:03:07.450" style="s2">apologize when you&#39;re not right wrong</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.260" end="02:03:09.730" style="s2">right right don&#39;t apologize to get out</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.450" end="02:03:12.160" style="s2">of the situation but I actually think</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.730" end="02:03:14.500" style="s2">it&#39;s very powerful to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.160" end="02:03:16.990" style="s2">are all out here playing a very complex</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.500" end="02:03:17.530" style="s2">game with unwritten rules we do make</p>
<p begin="02:03:16.990" end="02:03:20.230" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.530" end="02:03:22.050" style="s2">mhm absolutely very powerful if you</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.230" end="02:03:24.550" style="s2">demonstrate that it&#39;s not that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.050" end="02:03:27.070" style="s2">constitutionally against apology its</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.550" end="02:03:29.950" style="s2">secured against using apology for</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.070" end="02:03:32.140" style="s2">expedience right yeah then being well</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.950" end="02:03:34.780" style="s2">admitting that you&#39;re wrong is is so</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.140" end="02:03:36.430" style="s2">interesting because it&#39;s this it can be</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.780" end="02:03:37.960" style="s2">this intensely painful experience you</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.430" end="02:03:40.000" style="s2">know it&#39;s sort of a just an ego blow to</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.960" end="02:03:42.550" style="s2">say like I was wrong about that but all</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.000" end="02:03:45.160" style="s2">it does is increase the perception of</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.550" end="02:03:46.750" style="s2">you from the other side or from whoever</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.160" end="02:03:47.920" style="s2">you&#39;re in dialog with people like it</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.750" end="02:03:48.130" style="s2">when other people admit that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.920" end="02:03:49.660" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.130" end="02:03:51.790" style="s2">that&#39;s a it shows a level of maturity</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.660" end="02:03:54.150" style="s2">and sort of flexibility and good</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.790" end="02:03:56.770" style="s2">judgements and yet it is a very</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.150" end="02:03:59.800" style="s2">difficult emotional experience to go</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.770" end="02:04:02.440" style="s2">through well I think because if you said</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.800" end="02:04:04.320" style="s2">well it elevates you in people&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.440" end="02:04:07.630" style="s2">when you admit that you were wrong so</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.320" end="02:04:08.950" style="s2">you know do it a lot right then people</p>
<p begin="02:04:07.630" end="02:04:10.390" style="s2">don&#39;t trust you right because then the</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.950" end="02:04:13.120" style="s2">point of how you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.390" end="02:04:14.740" style="s2">it right or you&#39;re doing it knowing that</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.120" end="02:04:18.300" style="s2">you have a get-out-of-jail-free card</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.740" end="02:04:18.300" style="s2">right but if you</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.170" end="02:04:22.409" style="s2">reserve it if you&#39;re very careful so</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.880" end="02:04:25.830" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have to apologize very</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.409" end="02:04:29.909" style="s2">often but you do it readily when you</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.830" end="02:04:31.860" style="s2">need to then that creates the right the</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.909" end="02:04:35.389" style="s2">illusion of being a really good person</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.860" end="02:04:39.540" style="s2">hell yeah even if what you say yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.389" end="02:04:41.820" style="s2">conservative conservative and bad and</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.540" end="02:04:43.860" style="s2">belly yeah just bad powerful words</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.820" end="02:04:45.869" style="s2">they&#39;re bad that&#39;s partially redundant</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.860" end="02:04:47.040" style="s2">well I guess John McDermott didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.869" end="02:04:49.949" style="s2">you in the piece but we are actually</p>
