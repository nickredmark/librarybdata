<p begin="00:00:29.599" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">tweeting about</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:34.000" style="s2">where we were in history and claiming</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">that it was still</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.000" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">august even though we were nearly</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">halfway through september at the time</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:41.440" style="s2">but i&#39;m not embarrassed i&#39;m just i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:47.840" style="s2">situation here</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">and personalities and living situation</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.840" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">allowed us to get through lockdown which</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:56.320" style="s2">is still persisting</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">with a fair bit of grace</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">but the effective lockdowns that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:01.760" style="s2">fires have</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:02.960" style="s2">um have caused now in the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.760" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">northwest</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.960" end="00:01:06.400" style="s2">uh are actually really doing a number on</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">both of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.400" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">uh being actually forced to stay inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">and still having air quality inside</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">begin to decay</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">because no building is is completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:18.159" style="s2">smoke proof</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.200" style="s2">is well it&#39;s actually it&#39;s exhausting on</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.159" end="00:01:21.439" style="s2">top of everything else</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.200" end="00:01:22.640" style="s2">it&#39;s actually tiring to to feel this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.439" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">kind of trapped</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.640" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s uh it&#39;s both physically tiring</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">i have a feeling that you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.439" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">i feel i&#39;m doing better with the smoke</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">than i would have expected but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s beginning to uh be physically tough</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">to just deal with it day after day</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">yeah um but also you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">obviously been</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">um talking about the fact that we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">lucky to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">locked down as the weather was getting</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">nicer and the days were getting longer</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">and we were fearing what would happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">winter drove people indoors and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">fires have</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:56.719" style="s2">created a little taste of what that will</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">be like and i must say</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.719" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">it really does increase the challenge so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">because yeah the loophole in kovid was</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.399" style="s2">that outdoor was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">was safe well this is i mean this is i</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.399" end="00:02:10.479" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">worse um because going outside you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.479" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">even when you&#39;re masked and you know we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t have surgical masks so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">might be better if you actually had an</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">n95 but</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">um your lungs and sinuses start to hurt</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">pretty quickly at this level of smoke at</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">at least for us and so you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">the beautiful things about the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">northwest</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">is uh that basically you can dress for</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">almost any weather condition and go out</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">in it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:35.440" style="s2">most of those weather conditions won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">be your preferred weather condition but</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.440" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">you can you can deal with it and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">this actually just doesn&#39;t allow for</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">that you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">i have saw something about one of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">weather apps today that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:45.040" style="s2">hadn&#39;t seen before i&#39;ve seen dense fog</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">advisories</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.040" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve had now for days apparently a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">dense smoke advisory</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">um we&#39;ve got um our wildfire evacuation</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">zone here in portland is getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">downgraded um which is to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">the areas in clackamas county that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">are um in these sort of get ready to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">evacuate zones are receding</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">somewhat but the fires are still</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">completely uncontained</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">uh and the rain the promised rain didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">come and hopefully it will come soon but</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">it sort of it feels like this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">endless</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:20.720" style="s2">endless awfulness uh the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">between this and early covet lockdown is</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.720" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">you look out the window and you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">uh sort of this yellow toxicity in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">air</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">yeah i looked at um the weather app</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">uh dark sky and it said uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">winter is coming and full of terrors</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:38.480" style="s2">which i thought suggested a not too</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">careful reading</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.480" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">of game of thrones at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">yeah absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s really it&#39;s really tough</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s day after day it really has</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">taken um even the strange way that time</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">was proceeding</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">before the fires and seemingly grounded</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">to a halt just it constantly looks the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.480" style="s2">same out the window and very bleak</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.840" style="s2">uh in the guardian and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">guardian is uh as woke on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.840" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">of the pond as the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">um is on this side of the pond by a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">but this is um</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">this is this is quite a good op-ed and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">think you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">because because this researcher um she</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">is i think she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">dendrochronologist so her background is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">looking at tree rings and assessing um</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">not just age but sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">climatic and weather events from tree</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">rings</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">um she she argues</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">here as she did with her co-authors in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">this 2010 paper and is presumably many</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:05.039" style="s2">times since</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">as we did in our last episode against</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.039" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">the 20th century regime of fire</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">suppression in the american west</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">and for uh what we were calling</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">uh i believe it was like a 1991 paper or</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">something pyro diversity</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">which i just kind of liked the term and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">so when i keep saying it the idea being</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:26.960" style="s2">that more types of smaller</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">more heterogeneous fires in the american</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">west and presumably anywhere where there</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">is a normally recurring fire regime</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">will actually increase lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">around ecosystem health but specifically</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">the measure that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">i found evidence for was biodiversity i</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">i am not buying this pyro diversity</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">thing at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">right not falling for at this time i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">going for pyro equity that&#39;s what i want</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">to see oh no</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">yes so all fires have equal outcomes is</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">that what we&#39;re shooting for</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">no i don&#39;t i think it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">burning of white people i don&#39;t know but</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">something good</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">and the conversation grinds to a halt</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">you&#39;re only minutes in</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:03.919" style="s2">only minutes in yeah so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">things she says in this uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.919" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">in this very good op-ed in the guardian</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">is we can&#39;t reverse the anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">heat and forest drought situation that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">we have created by which he&#39;s referring</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">climate change that portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">increased fires in the american west</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">that are attributable to climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">change she says we cannot reverse that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">situation at least in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">but we can aim to reverse the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">our century-long fire deficit</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">and so this i mean i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">exactly the kind of analysis that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">need we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">she&#39;s not pretending um that long</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">term uh we don&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">nor do we have nor do we and we have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">actually address uh the anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.800" style="s2">anthropogenic climate change</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">um the 30 to 50 by the numbers that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.800" end="00:07:50.800" style="s2">was finding and reporting on last time</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">um of the increased fires in the west</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.800" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">that attributable to anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">climate change but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">awful lot left that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">explained and some of it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:02.400" style="s2">there will always be fires and um but</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">you know a fire if all fires are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.400" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">created equally of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">and so um the sheer the rapidity</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">of the spread of these fires and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">absolute uh you know terrifying damage</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">and death that they have brought</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">is not a normal feature of an american</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">west burning as far as we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">either in modern times or from like tree</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">rang and pollen core studies</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">so um there are a number of ways to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">at this one i would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">i saw this article i also saw there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">one in propublica</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">earlier this week um with the title</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:38.959" style="s2">something like given that we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">stop these fires</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.959" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">why don&#39;t we yeah and i read it</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">and it mirrored almost exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">perspective that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">advanced off the cuff on our last live</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">stream which was</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">you know reassuring um it did</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">it was off the cuff for you but i had</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">done some preparation you had done some</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">preparation</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">um but in any case um</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">the problem here is that we are again</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">wandering into a politicized landscape</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">which makes it impossible to do what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.279" style="s2">needs to be done right so at some level</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for an analysis that says</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.279" end="00:09:13.680" style="s2">something like the following</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">we have an entirely anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.680" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">some of that anthropogenic problem can</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">with solutions that we have and some of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">it is now outside of our control</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">to the extent that we have altered the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">climate that is not something that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">have the technology to unalter at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">to the extent that we have altered the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">fuel load</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">through a naive pattern of fire</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">suppression we do have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">address this and again as i said in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">last live stream</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:42.480" style="s2">the key question is one of equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">if you think about the fuel that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">ends up accumulating if you prevent fuel</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">from burning off it accumulates</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">on the forest floor or as as you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">decaying biomass and then when a fire</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">does come</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">it&#39;s hotter and bigger than it would</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">otherwise be it may take out species</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">that are otherwise built to deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.800" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">with fire and so the real question is</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">how much stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">has built up ready to burn and if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">are removing one of the processes that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">eliminates that stuff then you will have</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">a disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:18.959" style="s2">large amount of it which will cause an</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">ecologically unusual phenomenon so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">you have to get back to equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">somehow or you have to set an</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">equilibrium that you now know how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">manage</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">there&#39;s no two ways about this yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">i agree with this the only</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">the only issue i would take with what</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">you just said is that you led with</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">we have an entirely anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">problem and i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">by what analysis you arrive there you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">know the the west</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">the west coast of north america unlike</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">the east coast for instance</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">tends to burn regularly um even absent</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">modern levels of population density</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">and um and it seems even before there</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">were people you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.160" style="s2">the pre-columbian people the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">americans were here</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.160" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">um setting regular fires to do a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">a landscape management you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">pollen cores going back</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:04.320" style="s2">if memory serves from the last</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">livestream like 200 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.320" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">and there have been regular fires this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">is exactly what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:12.360" style="s2">but so in what so obviously fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">american west is not entirely an</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.360" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">anti-anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">the problem is that the disaster is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">anthropogenic</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">fire is natural and the point is what</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">does fire look like under normal</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">well it looks like a pattern in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">chaotic sparking from lightning</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">primarily that results in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">places that have accumulated more fuel</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">being more likely to catch fire</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s spreading to a point and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">burning out</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">and is it that california would catch</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">fire no</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s never been that way pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">california will catch fire</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">while others have so recently caught</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">fire that they&#39;re not vulnerable anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">and so what you get is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">patchwork dynamic in which the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">the species that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">are in the location are adapted to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">fire regime because the fire regime has</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">existed for millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">everything functions this way you walk</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">in it can&#39;t be exactly like that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">anymore but the the naive thing is to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">assume</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">that you can just simply intervene and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">bend it to your will</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">and the answer is nature bats last right</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">it has the capacity to you know yes you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">can suppress fire for</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">100 years and then what happens then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">have these mega fires that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">manage right</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">so what we need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">recognize that the wise approach is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">that disrupts the regime that functions</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">as little</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">as possible which doesn&#39;t mean zero but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:45.040" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">the propublica article mentioned all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.040" end="00:12:48.800" style="s2">the stuff we talked about it mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">the fact that sprawl is causing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">problem the fuel load is causing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">problem and i should say the president</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">um said something crazy about trees</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">exploding which he got</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">dragged for on twitter but in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.680" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">what he was struggling to articulate was</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:05.519" style="s2">this point about fuel</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.040" style="s2">buildup trees exploding okay well he</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.519" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">said something crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.040" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">you know true to form it was sort of off</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">the cuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">nonsense but i think i&#39;m going to remain</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">blissfully unaware of the specifics</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">perfect well anyway uh what he was</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">talking about was the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">fuel and its impact on fire regimes and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:24.240" style="s2">you know everybody&#39;s aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">problem yeah at what point are we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.240" end="00:13:28.720" style="s2">modernize our</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:30.160" style="s2">approach yeah all right well one more</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.720" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">thing to say about fires</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.160" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">um to follow up from last time is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.440" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">um is an observation from</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">some some zoom earth</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">real-time satellite images zach if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">would show the screen</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:50.320" style="s2">um this is uh this was sent to us</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">by a listener with um</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.320" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">considerable background in uh this kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">um in this kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">and said just take a look this person</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">just take a look at what the fires uh in</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">the pacific northwest specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">oregon look like from the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">september</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">and so uh without saying anything more</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">about them just going to move through</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">september first</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">all the little red things are you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:16.160" style="s2">fires obviously and we&#39;ve got cloud</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">cover</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">second third fourth</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">fifth sixth seventh</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">eighth oof ninth</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">tenth 11th 12th now we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">um smoke as well as the atmospheric</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">um 13th 14th</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">15th and that gets us to today um so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">let me just go back to the seventh where</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">for those</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">uh listening only and not watching you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">see some</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">fires um scattered throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:56.839" style="s2">um in eastern washington looks like like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">the okanagan</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">in east central</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">oregon a few little ones in oregon and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">some certainly up in sort of trinity</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">alps area</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:10.240" style="s2">and such in northern california and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">you go one day forward and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.240" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a tremendous number of fires</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">um you know roads aren&#39;t on here but to</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">anyone familiar with pacific northwest</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">that looks like a line of fires along</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">the five</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:27.920" style="s2">along the interstate five to me and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">um i&#39;m not saying that is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.920" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">um i have not mapped this on to the five</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">uh nor can we say at this point for sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">what exactly is going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">um but we know we know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.440" style="s2">that at least some of the fires that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">um that have been happening the pacific</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">northwest in the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">uh we&#39;re arson we&#39;re human set we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">intentional</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">and the fact that you have a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">upsurge in the fires all along a line</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">that is easy to access</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">on one day is certainly suspicious</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:08.079" style="s2">and what we see is what looks like sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">of a knee-jerk rejection of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.079" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">that any of the fires are arson from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">official sources</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.199" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">at least in the state of oregon which</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">you know given</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">how busy everyone is right now the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">effective analysis has already been done</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">and they can completely rule out arson</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">for any of these strikes</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">me as itself an indicator that um</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">perhaps something is being covered up</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">so let&#39;s just uh do this correctly</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">there are processes that could associate</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">fires with roads that have nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">with arson for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:40.800" style="s2">people sometimes pull a car onto a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">median that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.800" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">grass and the hot uh exhaust absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">the car can catch stuff on fire it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">usually completely obvious when this has</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">in general these things you know catch</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:55.920" style="s2">grasslands on fire and they&#39;re quickly</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">put out but not always</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.920" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">um and there was a severe wind event</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">that was happening there was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">severe wind event there are of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">people find patterns and of course it</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">could be that you know the pattern was</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">the wind</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">regime which dried things out and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.160" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">you know a lot of cars that broke down</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.240" style="s2">and got</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">got the grass hot under them and set</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.240" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">fires that otherwise wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have become raging infernos yep</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">or sparks that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">not have ordinarily triggered uh fires</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">might under those unusual conditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">from many sources of produced fires</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">could be accidents i mean people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">fling cigarette butts out the window the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">way they once did from their cars but</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s lots of stuff that could</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">create a pattern including it could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.160" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">random and look like a pattern to us</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">um you know because sometimes random</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">points line</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">up on the other hand what i think we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">is and i&#39;m you know i thought a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">bit about your term knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">rejection of the idea that these fires</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">were intentionally set and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve gone both ways on it and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">about it i think what we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">is an environment in which the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">claim that a fire started with arson</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">is now a political claim that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">and because it is a political</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">claim this isn&#39;t even um</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">knee-jerk suggesting uninvestigated this</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">an automatic tribesmanship it&#39;s snatches</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">it&#39;s tribal</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">and the problem is you can&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:32.160" style="s2">a society this way you cannot have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">disagreement over</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.160" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">facts because the facts point in an</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">inconvenient political direction</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.600" style="s2">and of course we&#39;ve seen this many times</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:41.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen it with climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.600" end="00:18:43.280" style="s2">other such things and you know very</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">frequently people like you and me who</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.280" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">reason from</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">first principles and try to do so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">soberly with a scientific background are</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">often caught</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">in between the two camps right you and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">fall out</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">in the anthropogenic climate change camp</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">we&#39;re no fan of the models that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">usually used to defend this position</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">right so and you know there&#39;s or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">uh you know where scientists trust us do</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:11.280" style="s2">what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">say because we&#39;re wearing the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">clothes and have the right degrees</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">approach which is itself of course uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">you know leading by authority which</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">is a just a step away from authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">approach which is anti-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">right and so at some level the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">we are staring at the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">from no cause greater you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">anything more</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">than the simple agreement to take the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">facts</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.120" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">and capture them for your side that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">sufficient because that will collapse</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">medicine it will it will cause economics</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">fall apart or to serve one side at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">expense of another there</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">you cannot have a situation in which we</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">can&#39;t at least agree on what took place</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">before we get around to arguing what to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">make of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">and the idea that we are living in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">state in which</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">fires are raging out of control health</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">severely compromised and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">there is any possibility that we would</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">even have to worry</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">that we were being protected from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">information that fires were the result</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">of arson</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">is uh already evidence that we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">just a dire scenario yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">even if they&#39;re not arson we want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">know that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">that idea has been fully vetted before</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s been rejected and we know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">that in some cases it&#39;s unambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">right we can see on twitter evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">fireworks associated with certain fires</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">where citizens put them out</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">so yeah man how did we end up here</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:46.640" style="s2">well yeah that&#39;s some of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">trying to talk about and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.640" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t it but uh let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">let&#39;s pivot if if we can because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">a lot of stuff not related to what we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:54.720" style="s2">talked about in the last episode that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:56.960" style="s2">want to talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.720" end="00:20:58.240" style="s2">i did want to spend a moment um</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.960" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">message that she was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">convey is not that this hypersexualizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">of um pre-teen girls</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">a burqa uh your entire adult life um</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.159" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">but so i was compelled by her she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.280" style="s2">she&#39;s a you know clearly an</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:34.640" style="s2">extremely smart beautiful woman with um</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.280" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">who&#39;s pulling</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.640" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">a lot of what she&#39;s talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">this film from what she&#39;s seen in her</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">own life and she interviewed a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">pre-teen girls</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">herself um in paris immigrants from</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">senegal</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">uh and so you know that all suggests</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">that this this work had a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">behind it this art had a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">behind it but</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">um but she doesn&#39;t achieve what she</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">and the ends don&#39;t justify the means so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">i i wanted to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">i recommend watching her six minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">video interview</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">while i don&#39;t recommend watching the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">film um</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">and it reminded me i&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.720" style="s2">defending</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">um the film i&#39;ve seen a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.720" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">rejecting the film on social media and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">suspect that they haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve similarly seen a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">defending the film on social media and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">sort of suspect that many of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">and i i suspect actually that if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">seen the six minute video</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">um as opposed to the clip of the girls</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">twerking</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">and that was all you had seen you would</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.120" style="s2">find it very easy to get slide into one</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">of these positions or the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.120" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">and that frankly the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">intelligentsia on the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">is much more likely to be compelled by</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">you know beautiful and eloquent and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">smart filmmaker um speaking for six</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">minutes about her intentions</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:55.919" style="s2">than other people might be so i was</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">reminded of um</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.919" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">actually just my first first two years</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">in college when i was a literature major</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">before i ran away</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">precisely because of the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">conversations that were happening that</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">they were that there was just no way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">assess the validity</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">um of the narratives that were being put</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">forward to explain what we were reading</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">in these</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">um clearly fictional um narratives um</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">so the discussions this would have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">back in the late 80s surrounded around</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">whether or not we should assess art on</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">its own</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">or if we needed to include an awareness</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:27.440" style="s2">and analysis of the creator</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">and his or her intentions in the art uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.440" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">and broadly speaking this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:34.799" style="s2">a sort of a brand of theory called</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">historical biographical criticism and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.799" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">is a critical method that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">um and here i&#39;m quoting wikipedia the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">excellent source um</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">that um historical biographical</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">criticism is a critical method that sees</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">a literary work chiefly</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">if not exclusively as a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">its author&#39;s life and times</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">that is you cannot be expected to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">actually take the art and assess the art</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">on its own you have to wrap it up in all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">of its context</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">um and to that i would say i&#39;m often</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">most people are often interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">backstory</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">of the creator of a piece of work or to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">read an artist&#39;s statement if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">available right</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">but it shouldn&#39;t and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">critical to interpreting the art the art</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">must stand on its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">and the idea that especially when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">have a piece of art that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">um that looks like this the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">you have to include</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">the intentions of the creator in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">assessment of whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an honorable thing to be out</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">there i think is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.720" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">exactly wrong so i&#39;ve seen it argued um</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">that there was no intention um that this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">was sexually exploitative</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">um and therefore it&#39;s not right um and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t buy that now i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">neither of us are calling this porn so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:49.840" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to go there um</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">but we we did and we are calling it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.840" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">sexual</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">sexual exploitation of pre-teen girls</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">both of the actresses</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">and potentially leading to more of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">same by people watching it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">and uh the fact that the intention might</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">have been in fact the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">by the creator doesn&#39;t actually change</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">the fact of the art itself um</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">well i&#39;m not a hundred percent convinced</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">that the background of the maker can</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">never be</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:22.480" style="s2">required for the art to be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m just imagining</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.480" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">that there&#39;s certain things um</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s certain things that require</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">standing</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">in other words if a holocaust survivor</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">wants to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">make a peace in which they humanize</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">a guard in a concentration camp</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">that&#39;s very different than if some</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">person with no connection</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">decides to do it and so i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">that the art shouldn&#39;t be able to stand</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">on its own</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m saying that in that case the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">context might allow me</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">to engage the art openly it might it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">might allow a window into it it might</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">allow you to approach it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">you would not otherwise choose to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:04.080" style="s2">approach it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that sounds completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.080" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">valid to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">i guess in this case i worry that this</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">will do that job</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">oh right that this you know that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">know we did watch it we did not</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">speak publicly about it before we had</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2">actually seen the film</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">and uh you know in many ways it was you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">beautifully done but but the girls</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">are heavily sexualized and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:30.559" style="s2">you know if even if it&#39;s only those four</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">child actors right</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.559" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">even if that&#39;s the only effect um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">much it&#39;s too much and you know your</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">point last last episode was</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:40.799" style="s2">if this were a book that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">different situation right because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.799" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">could explore something without anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">being hurt yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">now in this case i think if we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">know now that we know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">that you know based on your viewing of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">six minute uh piece that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">my interpretation of that last scene</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">which is too brief</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">to make its point is actually the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">one that actually she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">judging both these things both the</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">overly restrictive</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">um you know muslim upbringing and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">overly</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">um liberated which isn&#39;t even the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">word but sexualized</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">um western alternative she&#39;s judging</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">both of them which i actually think is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">very important point but</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">what happened here is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">predictable western tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">which is that this person who has</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">standing sees a problem delivers</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">a film and it is two things happen one</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">it is co-opted by a very western entity</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:44.559" style="s2">netflix right which sees this as a much</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">as a very saleable property precisely</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.559" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:48.559" style="s2">you know it invalidates half of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">filmmaker&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.559" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">in order to sell this thing this is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">is a small art form</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not that netflix distributing it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">was was a fail that was potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">huge win but allowing them to do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">marketing once they</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">had signed onto the distributing um</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">clearly did indicate exactly the fail</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">frankly i think the only reason that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">netflix gives a [ __ ] about this film</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">which they clearly did was that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">could use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:13.440" style="s2">for for an ironic purpose which was to</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">capture an awful lot of attention either</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.440" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">because of the controversy</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">or because uh they had these sexualized</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:23.279" style="s2">girls you know and that that should sell</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">even though it shouldn&#39;t sell right</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.279" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">so um netflix what it did</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">is despicable it creates</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">a lens through which most people arrive</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">at the film which will cause them to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">the wrong message out of it which will</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">cause you know so</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">it distorts the film and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">um the other thing which i think is even</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">more frightening</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">is that because we live in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:51.919" style="s2">constantly pushing uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">youthful female sexuality to sell</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.919" end="00:29:55.039" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">right because that&#39;s the lens that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.039" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">being imposed on society by</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">marketers um and presumably people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">sell porn</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">right that lens means that this film</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">which is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">repulse you with the sexualization of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">these young girls</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work that way for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:12.880" style="s2">audience there&#39;s some fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.880" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">that finds it positive and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">gets entirely the wrong message from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">film</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">so um you know that is uh it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">revealing phenomenon that this film has</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">created i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">you know in addition to the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">that you point out which is that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">uh considers themselves an expert on</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">this film whether or not they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">anything beyond the poster</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">right right so um yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">uh one way or the other this film seems</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">to reveal a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:48.399" style="s2">failings in our system and uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.399" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">you know what to do about it is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">question but</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">obviously the market didn&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">problems here the market</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:59.919" style="s2">created many problems yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">all right well um lots of other places</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">we could uh we could rip the new york</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">times to shreds</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">oh my god do you mean physically or i</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t bring it no</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">no i just have to be with words let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">it metaphorically you want to start</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">there why not</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">pull this up hold on where did it go</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">okay zach would you show this this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">uh this is from the sunday</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">this last sunday&#39;s new york times the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">front page very front page</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">um september 13th 2020 has this graphic</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">for those of you who are listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">not watching um biden stays ahead joe</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">biden is leading among likely voters in</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">four swing states including one donald</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">trump narrowly won in 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">and it would appear to be a simple</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">graphic it would appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">deeply quantitative wouldn&#39;t it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">like looks like numbers and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.200" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">you can trust them</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">because once it&#39;s numbers once it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">counted it&#39;s got the stamp of authority</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">so what we have is the results of a poll</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">from september 2020</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">and in four states with biden leading in</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">and we are the new york times is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">comparing that to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">the results from 2016</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">in which um</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.000" style="s2">in which well it doesn&#39;t even matter in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.000" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">sorry i got distracted they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">at these these numbers um as one does</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:38.559" style="s2">um that is not the comparison that this</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">calls for</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.559" end="00:32:43.279" style="s2">in what world does it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">actually to compare the results of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.279" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">poll in september 2020</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">to the actual election results following</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.279" style="s2">what i want to see and what would</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">actually have been worth noting</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.279" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">and looking at and considering is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">results of a september 2020 poll</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:01.679" style="s2">compared to the results of a september</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">2016 poll</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.679" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">if you want to also include the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">results okay and then you can also</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:08.799" style="s2">compare those not just to what people</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">are thinking right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.799" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">but to how people either changed their</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">minds</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.240" style="s2">in two months in 2016 or lied to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">pollsters because we know there was a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.240" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">the polls one way or another were really</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">really inaccurate</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">in 2016. so we are being asked to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">compare a poll</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">why do we think those are less accurate</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.320" style="s2">hard to name because it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:35:22.640" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">you know if i had to guess um my guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">is that those numbers would look</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">kind of similar for clinton</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">if i had to guess not that i have access</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">to those data because the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">decided to show something that is not</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">i am not enumerate but i looked at this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:53.599" style="s2">and the first pass at this chart</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:55.359" style="s2">succeeded in misleading me</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.599" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">i believed that they were making an</p>

<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">apples to apples i</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">i have done it to myself which is only</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">a live web page yeah that&#39;s right i</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t screenshot it</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">um here we go so they</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">say a bunch of things about trump um</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">some of which i think are true</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">um the most devastating example is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">dishonest inept response to the covet 19</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">um of his of his presidency uh in</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">yeah yeah um i also question uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">that biden has put forth any proposals</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">recently well</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">i i agree he&#39;s not running on anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:08.319" style="s2">positive there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">no i just don&#39;t think that he&#39;s he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.319" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">running he&#39;s not he&#39;s not the one</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">leading i would agree he&#39;s also um</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">played games with all of these claims</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:20.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">uh racial injustice and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.319" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">which are</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">for whatever reason very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.520" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">demonstrate scientifically and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">this is not a simple puzzle of one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">these parties being</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">um uh the proper defender of science or</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.520" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">like it right i did recover my train of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.520" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">if i knew i would and by the way i have</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">a little trick for how you do that which</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">is why i don&#39;t tend to get too lost on</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">you&#39;re going to say the thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">you&#39;re going to give us the trick yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">yeah i am good</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">so the thing was that i am hearing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">from the different places that i am</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.240" style="s2">tuned in some of which</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">are places that i find simpatico and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.240" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">other places are</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:40:59.680" style="s2">are ones that i find frightening in one</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">way or another</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:06.319" style="s2">but i am hearing totally divergent</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">narratives about where we are in terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.319" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">of um who&#39;s ahead how far ahead</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:12.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">presidential race in particular yes in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.960" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">other words</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">i think especially if i listen to</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">democrat</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">space there is an all-out push to sell</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">that biden is clobbering trump</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">by the numbers now mind you that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">exactly what we heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:34.160" style="s2">in 2016. it it it couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">more similar actually and i you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:39.119" style="s2">i know you&#39;re going someplace and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want you to lose this again but um</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.119" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">i bought it in 2016. yep i i and many</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">many people were shocked when we woke up</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">the day after the election</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">could not believe it like really thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:51.119" style="s2">it was an impossibility yeah i bought it</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">in spite of myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.119" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">right yeah i mean yes in spite of some</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">some of us it was in spite of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">um but uh i really believe it to be true</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">they&#39;re saying exactly the same stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">why and then they&#39;re putting things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.119" style="s2">this graphic new york times in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">they&#39;re making false comparisons and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.119" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">acting like they&#39;re the right ones</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">well why why do we think this is any</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:15.119" style="s2">different right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">i mean the thing is we know</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.119" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">in retrospect what the problem was in</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:21.359" style="s2">2016</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">which was that there was noise in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.359" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">data that came from people not being</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">honest with those</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:28.160" style="s2">who were taking the polls so what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">would want if you were going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.160" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">analysis and say oh this time the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">democrats really</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">are ahead you would want to know why</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:35.599" style="s2">this circumstance was less prone to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">noise</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.599" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">i have it the reason that uh the polls</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:41.119" style="s2">this time are more reliable than last</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.119" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">is that the culture of fear that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">predominating in the country in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">has disappeared we no longer have any of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">that we have achieved</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">the inclusive and equitable society that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">the people on the fringe left have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">in the streets with riots almost nightly</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">since the end of may and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">we have arrived</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">at a fully peaceful unicorn filled in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">rainbow filled utopia</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">right now i think that&#39;s right no i</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">think i think you&#39;ve nailed it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way we have an added</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">factor on the table</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">right and i just people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">take this the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">there i am not going to vote for donald</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">trump i&#39;m not going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:22.640" style="s2">but i want people to notice what</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">going on while we&#39;ve had this thick</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">smoke i think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">reduced yeah the meaning of it i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">consecutive nights</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">of uh protests that were all</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">are almost all followed by violent riots</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">later in the evening</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">i think they will too uh but it</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.400" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">a total lack of leadership um which is</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">well this is this this is a sane move</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">let me just say i won&#39;t vote for biden</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.520" style="s2">and i won&#39;t vote for trump yeah okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:24.319" style="s2">not going to vote for either one of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.520" end="00:45:24.640" style="s2">but i do want those who are so confident</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.319" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.640" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">this time we&#39;re finally on the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">track electorally those democrats who</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">um who are beating that drum they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:35.760" style="s2">missing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">fact that they are placing people like</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">citizens of portland in a position where</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">a rational argument for voting for trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">where i don&#39;t think that argument</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">existed in 2016. that&#39;s right even more</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:50.640" style="s2">people will not say</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">to their friends and family and</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.640" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">certainly not to pollsters</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:55.599" style="s2">you know what this time i&#39;m doing it yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">they will</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.599" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">they will lie to protect to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:03.200" style="s2">peace within their own spheres</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">and we know that was happening last time</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.200" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">i just anecdotally we have seen we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">heard from so many people</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">and we see the situation that you that</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">you have just laid out</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">on the ground here and in many other</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">places where cities which tend to vote</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">blue which tend to vote democrat</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">there have got to be a lot of citizens</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">in a lot of places going</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what my choice is here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">how about</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">the leadership the locally elected</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">leadership actually step up and do their</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:32.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m not forced to do something that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:36.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">predicament and it does</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:41.440" style="s2">uh yeah put the lie to these</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">these data which seem to suggest one</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.440" end="00:46:45.200" style="s2">thing or another because</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">at some level people have more reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">there&#39;s more of a reason for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">noise in the data</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:51.280" style="s2">that is born of people being dishonest</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">about what they&#39;re actually planning to</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.280" end="00:46:53.119" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:54.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t i mean i don&#39;t i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.119" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">that&#39;s noise i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.720" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">hidden hidden pattern that goes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">opposite way that the polls are saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">um yeah i agree it&#39;s it&#39;s systematic</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">bias yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">um okay yeah so what&#39;s the trick for</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">getting back to your train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">now i fear saying this out loud because</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:12.400" style="s2">once you publicly have a trick for</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">getting back to your train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.400" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">when you lose your train of thought and</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">the trick doesn&#39;t work people are going</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">to think</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">something&#39;s up but the trick is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">you put yourself you can very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">recover the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">feeling that you had as you were</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">the thought like the emotional feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">and then you find that emotion again you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">put yourself back in that emotional</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">mindset</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">and very frequently it sort of edits</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">down the range</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">of things that you might have been</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:43.680" style="s2">you know you sort through six or seven</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">thoughts and there it is that&#39;s so good</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.680" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s emotion dependent memory</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">analogized i would say to state</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">dependent learning that is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">it is and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:55.760" style="s2">um you know i&#39;ve talked about state</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">dependent learning</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">having uh important relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:01.359" style="s2">music and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:03.599" style="s2">and this is this is where that thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.359" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">came from is that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.599" end="00:48:07.040" style="s2">coded there&#39;s basically a dewey decimal</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">system of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.040" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">you know there&#39;s an emotional catalog so</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">that you&#39;re not constantly searching the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">sum total of all the things you might</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">um say or think you&#39;re only searching</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:19.200" style="s2">the relevant part</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">so maybe maybe you don&#39;t want to go here</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">but i guess i&#39;m surprised uh that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">find enough nuance in your emotional</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">state from one moment to another</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:28.240" style="s2">especially when we&#39;re like live</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">streaming here</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.240" end="00:48:31.359" style="s2">that you can identify oh this was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">it was like two minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.359" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">i know what i was feeling then as</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">opposed to the minute either side of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">like how that&#39;s that&#39;s the level of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">specificity that i would</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how i would accomplish that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:43.760" style="s2">um i cannot say how easy it will be for</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">others it&#39;s possible that this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.760" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">really easy for everyone once you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">realize to try it</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">things you know like</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">you know you know i&#39;m weirdly good at</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">spotting</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">a particular voice and placing it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">if some</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">if some voice is used in a commercial i</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:02.800" style="s2">can very often figure out who you are</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">um so it might be one of those you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.160" end="00:49:09.599" style="s2">weird skills</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:10.559" style="s2">i sort of suspect it&#39;s not for some</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.599" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.559" end="00:49:14.960" style="s2">i think probably because the emotion is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">sort of a bigger category</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.960" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">right there&#39;s some general emotion that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">you have towards some specific story</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">and so that emotion holds all of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:27.040" style="s2">things that you think in its context and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">it is therefore slower to dissipate</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.040" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">because as you lose the particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">thread you&#39;re still in the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:33.119" style="s2">so you can very often if you realize</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost your train of thought you</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.119" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">can find</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">well how do i feel i don&#39;t know why i</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">feel that way because i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:39.599" style="s2">i was thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:42.640" style="s2">i still do feel that way and then you</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.599" end="00:49:44.559" style="s2">can sort of put yourself back there</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.640" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">and i guess maybe another thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.559" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">surprising me to me about this then</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">is that you don&#39;t just feel like oh [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">i forgot i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:54.720" style="s2">like why how is it that you can find</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">anything through the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.720" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">like low grade but something of a panic</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">response like ah</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s gone well actually you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:03.119" style="s2">funny there&#39;s an analogy for this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">and it connects a little bit to my</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.119" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">conversation that i had with greg</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">gutfeld on his podcast</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.920" style="s2">um where he talked about our podcast so</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">this is now totally tangled but</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.920" end="00:50:13.359" style="s2">we were talking about lucid dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">one of the things about lucid dreams</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.359" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">which i learned</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">through some stuff that the stanford</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">sleep research center had put out on</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">lucid dreams yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">was that the problem many people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">the beginnings of lucid dreams but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">discovery that you&#39;re dreaming is so</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.400" style="s2">jarring that it wakes you right up</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">right and you have to like not not look</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.400" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">right you have to calm yourself you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">to calm yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">the discovery that you&#39;re dreaming so</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t startle yourself awake and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of how you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">get through it and this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:44.559" style="s2">thing you have to not panic over the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:46.960" style="s2">fact that you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">lost your train of thought um admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.960" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">harder when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">streaming to a live audience but right</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">nonetheless you have to not panic over</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">actually as you get better at it you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">develop confidence that you can get back</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.839" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">to your thought if you work at it um</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">which also makes you calmer</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">ah right so uh the more you do it the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:05.920" style="s2">better you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">yep there&#39;s there&#39;s a positive practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.920" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">element too yeah</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:16.079" style="s2">the affinity of which is greater than</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.000" style="s2">fits with a number of things that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">talked about early in our live streams</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">and that you talked about with yuri</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.839" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">deegan tegan um in the podcast that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">did with him</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">uh and you know they&#39;ve just they also a</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:36.960" style="s2">big part of their argument here is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s been active censorship by</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.960" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">the scientific community</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">and by the journals um</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">presumably at least potentially also</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">therefore by the pre-print servers</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:48.960" style="s2">um against publishing anything that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">suggests uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.559" style="s2">a lab origin for the virus right and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">know and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.559" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">we did this for like 18 episodes running</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">back in our first 18 or so episodes but</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">um you know lab origin is not the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:03.599" style="s2">thing as bioweapon we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">um you know to say lab origin does not</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.599" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">specify whether or not you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">an inadvertent escape um on one end to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">an intentional release of an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">bioweapon on the other or anything in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:17.599" style="s2">and you know really most of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.520" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">analyses are imagining it&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.599" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">like oh my god this is being developed</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">and it escaped and no one ever meant it</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">to but really nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">how it got out into the world is part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">the analysis around</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">does it or does not does it not have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">lab origin i guess the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">as people who&#39;ve been watching for a</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">long time will understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">that lab origin doesn&#39;t mean created</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">from scratch in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">it means you know borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">from other viruses and um</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">made into a chimera slash engineered</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">primarily from parts that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">things it means composited</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">from natural sources but the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">that it means which has very ominous</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:01.200" style="s2">implications here</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">is what&#39;s called serial passage</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.200" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">experiments basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">use selection in the lab artificial</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">selection</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">to imbue viruses with capacities that</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">otherwise have and so again don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">what to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">of this paper though it looks to be very</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">well researched</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">but the paper is putting together some</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">of the things that we did talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.359" style="s2">early on about</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">how much of the frightening part of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.359" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">virus</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s diversity of organs that</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">it attacks right</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">its ability to transmit between human</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">how many of these features are actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">the result</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">of a guided evolutionary process in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">lab</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">coupled with a compositing which could</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">of totally honorable origin in other</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">words people who wish to study a virus</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">that was dangerous to humans may have</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:53.680" style="s2">created a virus that was unusually</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">dangerous to humans</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.680" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">and then it got out through an accident</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s the most likely scenario as</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">far as i&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">and we are now beginning to see analyses</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.799" style="s2">strongly reflect this so at a different</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">is that her story as a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">is not a typical one of her having been</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:36.880" style="s2">a brilliant student and</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.760" style="s2">this and that she is somebody who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.880" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">love school</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.760" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">always bridled against its uh its</p>

<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">as a um a brilliant virologist</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">who has spotted all the things that were</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">wrong about the story</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">of sars kovetu and investigated them and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">has established</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">many of these claims on a very rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:04.960" style="s2">basis falsified for example the</p>

<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">so anyway i would just recommend this</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:10.799" style="s2">article to people we will post a link to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.799" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">um but uh i i don&#39;t know maybe uh maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:17.520" style="s2">dr chan will come on the dark horse</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">podcast at some point because she seems</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.520" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">like a true dark horse</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">that would be great yep all right is it</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">has laid seven eggs and</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">um not only has she not had access to a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:02.160" style="s2">male for at least 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">um she&#39;s already a couple of decades</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.160" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">past her sell by date</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:08.079" style="s2">apparently usually they don&#39;t live that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">long but these eggs are</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.079" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">at least some of them are alive ah</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:15.280" style="s2">there were seven of them two of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">died two of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.280" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">were um i think killed for research</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:24.400" style="s2">and three of them as of as of right now</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.000" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">are still alive and have not there</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.400" end="01:00:28.000" style="s2">um let&#39;s see how do they they end the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">article with they are not</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.000" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">counting their snakes before they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">hatched um so there&#39;s three that are</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">um potentially going to hatch killed no</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">mistake with all of the scanning</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:41.200" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to imagine that there</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.200" end="01:00:44.319" style="s2">was any justification of that and i</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">could i&#39;m not actually positive that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.319" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">what happened to the two of them because</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s written for a lay</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t quite tell but i think i</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">think that they um they basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:55.760" style="s2">um collected the eggs for research</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">purposes and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">in so doing uh killed whatever embryos</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">might have been developing inside um but</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">there are three still out there</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">but this i mean this just raises so many</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">interesting questions</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:11.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it um we have for instance let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.599" style="s2">just let&#39;s just start with okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.680" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">she hasn&#39;t seen a male in 15 years could</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.599" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">she have stored sperm for that long</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">there are very long storm storm sporage</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:22.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not a thing that&#39;s not a thing um</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">sperm storage</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.839" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">uh things that organisms do</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:30.240" style="s2">uh usually it&#39;s not years and years and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">years but it certainly is</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.240" end="01:01:37.280" style="s2">known um in ants it is in ants yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">i said i said it yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.280" end="01:01:42.000" style="s2">as common in vertebrates yeah i think</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">um you know the example that i think of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.000" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">um with regard to storage</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">um actually there&#39;s just a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">ways to get around the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">you want to reproduce but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">sure you&#39;re going to be able to find a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:57.920" style="s2">mate at the right moment so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:59.359" style="s2">like we&#39;ve all been there oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.920" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">we&#39;ll have to talk about that yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.359" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">is awkward yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">like wolverines i&#39;m not sure wolverines</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">do sperm storage or do they just do</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">delayed implantation</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">yeah so they actually they they bring</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">sperm and egg together</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">and then they have they basically put</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">put that zygote</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">into stasis um throughout</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:22.240" style="s2">much of the fall and part of the winter</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:26.000" style="s2">while the wolverines are in</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.240" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">um basically in sleep for the winter and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">then they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">and then only at the point that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">seasonality is</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">looking right uh does the zygote get</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:37.599" style="s2">implanted in the uterine lining and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">start to develop um so that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.599" end="01:02:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s one way</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.680" style="s2">that uh reproduction can be delayed um</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.440" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">but actual just storing of sperm to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.680" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">used at some later point</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">is um is common in ants and i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.039" style="s2">a lot of a lot of other species that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">right you know a lot of mammals a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.039" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">bats</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">have a you know and these periods of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">storage just</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:58.880" style="s2">allow you to break the connection</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">between the mating period</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.880" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">and the point at which offspring are</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">born and there are lots of different</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:05.520" style="s2">versions of it where</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">the uh you know the place where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.520" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">pause happens in the reproductive cycle</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">can be moved along to different spots no</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:13.280" style="s2">and you know and just</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">because i want to talk about wolverines</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.280" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">for a moment more</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">um the example there is that because</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">they live in a cold habitat and</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:24.640" style="s2">basically need to hibernate in order to</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">make it through the winter uh you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.640" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">doing a lot of courtship while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">hibernating it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">just i&#39;m sorry i&#39;m about to reveal</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">my ignorance i thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">because wolverine specialized on large</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">carcasses i thought they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">hibernating have i misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:42.720" style="s2">wolverine behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">you know i didn&#39;t i should have i should</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">have looked up our our former student</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">alice&#39;s work on this before i started</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">talking about wolverines um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:53.039" style="s2">possible i&#39;ve misremembered</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">the hibernation thing but i think i</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.039" end="01:03:57.440" style="s2">think not</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">um and precisely the argument for pause</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.440" end="01:04:01.280" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">they they basically they do their meet</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.280" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">and greet and court chip</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:07.520" style="s2">and sexual reproduction um in the fall</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">when they actually are</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.520" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">going around sourcing food and then once</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">they&#39;re in their dens</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s and the timing is right such</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.119" end="01:04:15.760" style="s2">that a baby could be born as spring was</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.760" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">uh that&#39;s when implantation occurs but</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">um but we&#39;ll definitely correct that if</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">if i&#39;m wrong about that so if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:28.720" style="s2">wolverine and we&#39;ve gotten this wrong</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">don&#39;t panic we will fix the record</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.720" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">so it correctly reflects dallas if</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">you&#39;re watching which i know you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">been at some point in the past um</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">definitely correct me if i&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">wrong which i might be yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:41.039" style="s2">um but okay so sperm storage for over 15</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:42.720" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.039" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">in a ball python where that&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.720" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">noticed before</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:50.960" style="s2">probably not possible but probably not</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">so i would say chances are very very</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.960" end="01:04:55.359" style="s2">very low because</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">even if sperm storage were a thing there</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine an ecological</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">circumstance that would require that</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:05.119" style="s2">duration of sperm storage therefore yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">it&#39;s unlikely to work</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.119" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">zoo is a novel environment for ball</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">pythons yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:13.760" style="s2">yes very much so um so</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">probably it&#39;s facultative</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.760" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">parthenogenesis that&#39;s a couple of words</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">put together that sound like biospeed</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">because they are but facultative being</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:22.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">um counterpoint to obligate so if</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.319" end="01:05:26.559" style="s2">something is obligated it always happens</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:28.079" style="s2">100 of the time so humans are obligately</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.559" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">sexually reproducing</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.079" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">um and this bulb these ball pythons</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">apparently</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">are facultatively usually sexually</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">producing but facultatively</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.079" end="01:05:39.280" style="s2">parthenogenetic meaning that they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.280" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">self themselves probably not cloning but</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s possible but probably selfing</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:47.359" style="s2">um and let&#39;s go back to that because i</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">think we</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.359" end="01:05:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s some fun stuff to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">there but um another interesting thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.359" end="01:05:53.760" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">all snakes have long been understood to</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.760" end="01:05:57.440" style="s2">have genetic sex determination</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">that they have sex chromosomes just as</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.440" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">mammals do although it&#39;s a separate</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">evolution of sex chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:06.240" style="s2">and um just like birds do in fact which</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">is again a separate evolution of sex</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.240" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">chromosomes from mammals</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">um birds have a zw system not an xy</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">so in birds and mammals um</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">everyone probably watching or listening</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">to this will know this but maybe not in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">these terms</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">that female mammals are xx</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:26.319" style="s2">and because the two x&#39;s are the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:28.000" style="s2">chromosome looking chromosome that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.319" end="01:06:31.119" style="s2">called homo comedic same</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:33.599" style="s2">gamete and males who are xy mammals</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.119" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">are heterogametic different gametes at</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.599" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">that in the case of humans 23rd</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">chromosome position and that&#39;s true for</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:40.400" style="s2">all mammals except the monotremes which</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">are just</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.400" end="01:06:43.839" style="s2">weird and they&#39;ve got like nine pairs of</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">sex chromosomes and let&#39;s not talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.839" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">them at the moment that&#39;s the duckbill</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:50.000" style="s2">platypus and the two echidnas</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:51.599" style="s2">so they&#39;re bizarre but all of the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.000" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">marsupials and the placental mammals</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.599" end="01:06:55.920" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">us um have this xy system and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.920" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">birds have a different evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:02.480" style="s2">chromosomal sex determination</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.400" style="s2">uh which for just reasons of not</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.480" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">confusing them is called the zw system</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.400" end="01:07:09.280" style="s2">in which it&#39;s the females</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">who are heterogeneic so females are z-w</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.280" end="01:07:12.319" style="s2">and the males are homogeneic and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">actually don&#39;t remember i think i think</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.319" end="01:07:15.359" style="s2">it&#39;s cz i don&#39;t remember if we call them</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">zz or ww</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.359" end="01:07:18.960" style="s2">i just don&#39;t know um and that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:20.880" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">makes for some interesting predictions</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.880" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">about behavior that we won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:27.280" style="s2">here but are fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">and for a long time it was thought that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.280" end="01:07:31.440" style="s2">all snakes</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:36.240" style="s2">had like birds but separately evolved a</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.440" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">zw chromosomal sex determination system</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.240" end="01:07:40.880" style="s2">but a recent paper in 2017</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">finds that at least two lineages within</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.880" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">the boads a python and a boa not the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">ball python but a different species of</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:49.039" style="s2">python</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">have an xy system and that the python</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.039" end="01:07:51.440" style="s2">and the bow are themselves independently</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">evolved so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.440" end="01:07:54.720" style="s2">all these different evolutions of sex</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:57.200" style="s2">chromosomes within</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.720" end="01:07:58.000" style="s2">snakes at least three and probably more</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.200" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">all right so</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.000" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">am i correct in recalling that it is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.520" end="01:08:05.039" style="s2">python there&#39;s one snake lineage that</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:11.440" style="s2">vestigial limbs it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:13.520" style="s2">basil the the bowids okay and pythons</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.440" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">are boweds as boaz so this is weird</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.520" end="01:08:17.600" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:21.440" style="s2">within the bowed lineage you have an</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.600" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">xy system right apparently</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.440" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">all right now this this raises so many</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:27.359" style="s2">questions that we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.440" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">trouble our darkhorse audience with</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.359" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">because they&#39;re not going to want to go</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">into the weeds with us but some of them</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">here&#39;s the question yeah which thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">switched</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">while you talk zach you can just show</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:38.159" style="s2">this this so that people can look if</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">they want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.159" end="01:08:44.400" style="s2">yeah discovery of x so okay i am</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:45.920" style="s2">now frustrated assuming they don&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.400" end="01:08:47.839" style="s2">this out i&#39;m frustrated with our</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.920" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">colleagues for having defined this as an</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.839" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">xy system oh i agree</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:52.640" style="s2">and calling calling what&#39;s happening all</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">the rest of the snakes is ew says cw</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.640" end="01:08:55.600" style="s2">says no it&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the same every separate</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.600" end="01:08:58.640" style="s2">evolution of this should have its own</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.120" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">set of letters 100</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.640" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">talk about it and you know you could</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">come up with a convention so you knew</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:06.080" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">uh which but yeah um but here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.080" end="01:09:11.359" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:14.159" style="s2">two so if you have snakes</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.359" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">embedded within the boad lineage who</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.159" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">have an xy system</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">when the rest of snakes have a zw system</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:26.640" style="s2">if this is a reversal then the question</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:30.799" style="s2">is which thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.640" end="01:09:33.040" style="s2">reversed was it the sex did the sex flip</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.799" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">yeah that is to say the phenomenology of</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.040" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">the sex did it</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:38.000" style="s2">change which critter it was appended to</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.000" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">did the chromosomal system switch</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:46.239" style="s2">or and i think this is more likely given</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">what we see if we if we sort of map sex</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.239" end="01:09:49.920" style="s2">determination systems onto all of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:50.400" style="s2">vertebrates are all of tetrapods which</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.920" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:53.279" style="s2">vertebrates that have come onto land</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">that include the amphibians reptiles</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">birds and mammals</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">um you actually see you know quite</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">clearly that environmental sex</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.239" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">determination is basal</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">right that you have systems and you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:03.760" style="s2">many people will be familiar with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:04.640" style="s2">idea that there are some turtles for</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.760" end="01:10:06.640" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.640" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">where if you if your egg develops hot</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.640" end="01:10:09.280" style="s2">you you end up</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">female and if it develops cold you end</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.280" end="01:10:12.400" style="s2">up male um</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:14.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some where intermediate</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.400" end="01:10:16.400" style="s2">ones are female i</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.400" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">can&#39;t remember they&#39;re they&#39;re all all</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.400" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">three of the possible systems are out</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">there in terms of environmental sex</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:23.199" style="s2">determination which almost always means</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:24.480" style="s2">temperature sex determination yep that</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.199" end="01:10:27.520" style="s2">only works of course</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.480" end="01:10:29.360" style="s2">for um organisms that lay eggs a</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.520" end="01:10:30.719" style="s2">viviparous organism that had temperature</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">sex determination right</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.719" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">is not going to work because the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">mother&#39;s body temperature can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:37.199" style="s2">can&#39;t be totally different for different</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:39.120" style="s2">sex broods that&#39;s just not how</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.199" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">anatomy and physiology works if you did</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.120" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">it you&#39;d end up with broods that were</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:43.600" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:45.120" style="s2">the same sex right but then you&#39;d have</p>

<p begin="01:10:45.120" end="01:10:48.000" style="s2">unless there was a whole part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.239" end="01:10:48.880" style="s2">population that was at one temperature</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.000" end="01:10:50.320" style="s2">all the time and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.880" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">only produced female like it just it</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.320" end="01:10:54.400" style="s2">does it doesn&#39;t quite track but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">environmental sex determination is basal</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.400" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">and genetic sex determination seems to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:01.520" style="s2">evolve multiple multiple times within</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">the tetrapod lineage</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.520" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">and so more light more than more likely</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:08.159" style="s2">than some snakes going from a zy to an</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">xy system directly</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.159" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">they went back to not having sex</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:13.840" style="s2">chromosomes or not having them code for</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">yeah and then evolved or you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:20.080" style="s2">switched them while they weren&#39;t coding</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:22.400" style="s2">for sex into the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.080" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">the opposite thing which raises a really</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.400" end="01:11:25.920" style="s2">interesting question about what it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:27.360" style="s2">that causes an environmentally</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.920" end="01:11:28.640" style="s2">sex-determined creature to go</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.360" end="01:11:31.199" style="s2">chromosomal</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.640" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">etc but i think you don&#39;t want to get me</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.199" end="01:11:34.560" style="s2">started on that</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.760" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">no i don&#39;t um forgive me i think you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.560" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">have buried the lead slightly with</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">respect to</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">uh our audience and what they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">to think faculty apartheid</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.480" style="s2">there you go right that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:46.159" style="s2">we&#39;re going right here okay good i mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.480" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">go go for it that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.159" end="01:11:48.480" style="s2">big thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:50.239" style="s2">um but i just didn&#39;t want to not talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.480" end="01:11:53.440" style="s2">about the other stuff well okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.239" end="01:11:55.840" style="s2">so what i would want us to say is</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.440" end="01:11:58.600" style="s2">that this is a place where the failure</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.840" end="01:12:00.239" style="s2">of imagination amongst biologists the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.600" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">over-generalization from</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.239" end="01:12:04.800" style="s2">our own circumstance has i believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">caused us to miss the boat and we are</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.800" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">now very predictably getting schooled by</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:12.400" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:14.719" style="s2">on the following point as far as we know</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.400" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a mammalian example</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:22.239" style="s2">um except jesus christ of</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">um of parthenogenesis in a mammal</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.239" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">am i right that that&#39;s still true</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">parthenogenesis being reproduction of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:30.159" style="s2">female with no</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:32.239" style="s2">input from a male right so</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.159" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">this seems weird to us that anything</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.239" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">does this that any</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">uh animal does this or any vertebrate at</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:40.960" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:44.080" style="s2">but if you think about the puzzle of</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.960" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">how creatures find new places to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.080" end="01:12:47.600" style="s2">their creature thing how we get a</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:49.920" style="s2">species you know if you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.600" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">one species of python over here and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.920" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">you have a closely related species</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">of python over there that eat something</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:56.480" style="s2">different and behave slightly</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">differently but anyway they&#39;re related</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.480" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">but they ended up in two different</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">places what happened</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">well in general a creature</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:06.800" style="s2">will have gotten lost or you know i</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:08.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know some predatory bird could</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">pick up a python and accidentally drop</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.480" end="01:13:11.280" style="s2">it as it was carrying it to its nest in</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:14.320" style="s2">some new place</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.280" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">and this will happen a lot and in</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.320" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.239" style="s2">the animal that&#39;s dropped won&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:18.880" style="s2">to reproduce because there&#39;s only one of</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.239" end="01:13:22.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.880" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">and in the absence of a mate it will</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.000" end="01:13:25.520" style="s2">maybe get by maybe not but it will die</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">it will be the end of its lineage</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.520" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">if it is capable of reproducing</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:32.239" style="s2">then it could be an evolutionary winner</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:34.560" style="s2">of like an</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.239" end="01:13:36.239" style="s2">unimaginably great type which is the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.560" end="01:13:38.080" style="s2">founder of a new population</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.239" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">so the question is is there a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.080" end="01:13:41.520" style="s2">contingency plan</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:42.960" style="s2">built into creatures for those</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.520" end="01:13:44.880" style="s2">circumstances in which they find</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.960" end="01:13:47.280" style="s2">themselves in a habitat that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:48.239" style="s2">but for the absence of a mate now if</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.280" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a mammal</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.239" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">you might get blown off course for your</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:54.400" style="s2">bat you might get blown off course</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:55.920" style="s2">pregnant and you might find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.400" end="01:13:56.560" style="s2">someplace with a couple of offspring and</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.920" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.560" end="01:14:00.719" style="s2">the right sex to reproduce and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:02.080" style="s2">yes that&#39;s incest but nonetheless it</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.719" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">might still result in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">birth of a new population but</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">even easier if you physiologically are</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:11.280" style="s2">built for it is the production of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:14.159" style="s2">offspring</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.280" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">that would be triggered by extreme</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.159" end="01:14:17.360" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">right that the loneliness of a creature</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.360" end="01:14:20.560" style="s2">would be an indication that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:22.320" style="s2">nobody else of the right kind around</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.560" end="01:14:24.159" style="s2">and at some point loneliness would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.320" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">sufficient to trigger the production</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.159" end="01:14:31.600" style="s2">of either clonal or self-fertilized</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:32.880" style="s2">eggs which could then pending various</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.600" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">questions like do they have the right</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.880" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">chromosomal complement that you get</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:38.480" style="s2">multiple sexes out of the brood um that</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">could then</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.480" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">found a new population that should have</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:45.120" style="s2">happened many times but the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:46.719" style="s2">if you don&#39;t expect it because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.120" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">not doing the evolutionary theory very</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.719" end="01:14:50.400" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:51.760" style="s2">then you don&#39;t notice the fact that this</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.400" end="01:14:52.640" style="s2">is probably happening with some</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.760" end="01:14:54.880" style="s2">regularity</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.640" end="01:14:57.199" style="s2">even in your zoos you have to pay very</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.880" end="01:15:00.000" style="s2">close attention in order to know</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.199" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">that animal has not had access to</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.000" end="01:15:03.760" style="s2">another animal of its kind a closely</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:04.800" style="s2">related species with it which it might</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.760" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">hybridize</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.800" end="01:15:07.840" style="s2">right you have to know that really well</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">and frankly</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.840" end="01:15:11.360" style="s2">how many times has some zookeeper who</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:13.600" style="s2">does know it really well</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.360" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">said to the higher-ups at the zoo i</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.600" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know where these</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">eggs came from but that animal hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:20.400" style="s2">had a mate and the higher up at the zoo</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">is probably oh you must have messed up</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.400" end="01:15:24.960" style="s2">whatever right yeah so now we are in</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:26.719" style="s2">this era where we are discovering that</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.960" end="01:15:28.800" style="s2">lots of creatures it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.719" end="01:15:30.640" style="s2">produce offspring without reproducing</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.800" end="01:15:32.480" style="s2">when we isolate them</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.640" end="01:15:34.560" style="s2">which undoubtedly is revealing that this</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.480" end="01:15:34.880" style="s2">is a very common evolutionary mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.560" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.880" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got several examples now</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:41.679" style="s2">from the mates some</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:43.840" style="s2">some snakes some komodo dragons yep um</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.679" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got sharks you&#39;ve seen it in</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.840" end="01:15:48.880" style="s2">sharks yep um</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:50.840" style="s2">birds have you seen a bird yet not yet</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.880" end="01:15:53.840" style="s2">no i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.840" end="01:15:55.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.840" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.600" end="01:16:00.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t i think mammals and birds</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.400" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">happen but i think i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:07.520" style="s2">we&#39;re missing that why let&#39;s see um</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">mammals and birds are not each of their</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.520" end="01:16:10.400" style="s2">closest relatives</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.560" end="01:16:12.400" style="s2">their most recent common ancestor is the</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:15.679" style="s2">same as their ancestor with</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.400" end="01:16:16.400" style="s2">this python um which was a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.679" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">at the origin of</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.400" end="01:16:20.000" style="s2">tetrapod no it wasn&#39;t the origin of</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:23.520" style="s2">tetrapods but it was a long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.000" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">origin of reptiles um some</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.520" end="01:16:32.320" style="s2">combination of their endothermy</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">and their um high</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.320" end="01:16:39.199" style="s2">heart rate the the convergence of</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.440" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">cardiac anatomy and endothermic and</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.199" end="01:16:44.640" style="s2">um brain size and</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.640" end="01:16:45.840" style="s2">i can&#39;t quite put it all together but i</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.640" end="01:16:47.360" style="s2">actually i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.840" end="01:16:49.920" style="s2">think that mammals or birds are going to</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.360" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">end up with faculty of parthenogenesis</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.920" end="01:16:53.199" style="s2">and i want to think more on exactly why</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:54.960" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.199" end="01:16:56.480" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think so i don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">obstacle though the fact that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.480" end="01:17:01.360" style="s2">seen it in either of these two</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">clades yet um suggests you may be right</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.360" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">for reasons like</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:05.600" style="s2">i can&#39;t figure out i would say more</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:08.880" style="s2">likely in birds though</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.600" end="01:17:10.800" style="s2">because of the zw system right because a</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.880" end="01:17:12.239" style="s2">bird female you need to have an</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.800" end="01:17:12.880" style="s2">egg-laying creature in order to pull</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.239" end="01:17:15.440" style="s2">this off</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.880" end="01:17:16.320" style="s2">right a male mammal can&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.440" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">parthenogenic</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.320" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">offspring so a female has to do it and a</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:23.440" style="s2">female mammal</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">at least a marsupial or</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.440" end="01:17:27.760" style="s2">a placental would produce</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:30.880" style="s2">female offspring because she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.520" end="01:17:32.000" style="s2">have a y chromosome to throw at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.880" end="01:17:35.280" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.000" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">if she produces female offspring then</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.280" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">you get a line of females which is not</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">necessarily capable of switching back</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">into a sexual mode</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:44.000" style="s2">on the other hand a bird with zw could</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:45.840" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.000" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">a brood of eggs if she selfed rather</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.840" end="01:17:50.239" style="s2">than cloned she could produce</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:51.760" style="s2">a brood of eggs that was partially</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.239" end="01:17:52.880" style="s2">female and partially male and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.760" end="01:17:55.199" style="s2">the distinction being</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.880" end="01:17:56.480" style="s2">there are many many mechanisms for which</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.199" end="01:17:57.920" style="s2">you can get there but selfing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.480" end="01:17:59.199" style="s2">basically putting two of your own</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.920" end="01:18:01.760" style="s2">gametes together</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.199" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">uh to produce a zygote as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.760" end="01:18:04.239" style="s2">cloning</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:05.840" style="s2">and so with cellphone you end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.239" end="01:18:08.560" style="s2">reduction in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.840" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">um in genetic diversity genetic</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.560" end="01:18:11.440" style="s2">diversity yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">sounds like the right word but um you</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.440" end="01:18:16.960" style="s2">end up with more homogeneity</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:19.760" style="s2">um across loci um with selfing but</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.960" end="01:18:21.520" style="s2">you could get um a z gamete and a w</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.760" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">gamete coming together or a z gamut and</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.520" end="01:18:26.320" style="s2">a z gambit coming together</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:29.040" style="s2">even if you yourself um rzw</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.320" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re only xx you keep where</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.040" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">would you get the y gamete</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:34.640" style="s2">so you wouldn&#39;t be able to produce a</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:35.679" style="s2">male one last thing to your point about</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.640" end="01:18:38.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.679" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">you know the komodo dragon that um</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.800" end="01:18:42.320" style="s2">has swum across to a new island and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:43.040" style="s2">found itself unable to get back because</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.320" end="01:18:46.400" style="s2">of currents</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.040" end="01:18:49.520" style="s2">and is she is all alone um</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.400" end="01:18:53.120" style="s2">is that um this strategy</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.520" end="01:18:55.520" style="s2">of um of using extreme loneliness to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.120" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">prompt a reproductive event</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.520" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">only works for half of the organisms of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:02.239" style="s2">course right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:03.600" style="s2">males no matter how lonely cannot end up</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.239" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">selfing or cloning their way</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.600" end="01:19:08.640" style="s2">into uh into reproducing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:10.320" style="s2">you know this seems like you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.640" end="01:19:12.000" style="s2">i&#39;m just being mean or maybe this is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.320" end="01:19:15.440" style="s2">small point but this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.000" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">the fundamental thing that is why i</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:19.840" style="s2">and many others are just so adamant</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:21.520" style="s2">about you know what male is real and</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.840" end="01:19:23.040" style="s2">female is real and no amount of</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.520" end="01:19:24.400" style="s2">pretending is going to make it any</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.040" end="01:19:25.679" style="s2">different because it is about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:29.760" style="s2">gametes</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.679" end="01:19:31.920" style="s2">and female is to have a large incessal</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.760" end="01:19:34.080" style="s2">gamete and male is to have a</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.920" end="01:19:35.679" style="s2">small and motile gamete and what makes</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.080" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">that gamete large in the case of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.679" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">female</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">and that gamut being an egg it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:42.239" style="s2">cytoplasm it&#39;s all the cellular</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:45.199" style="s2">machinery of life that is necessary</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.239" end="01:19:46.640" style="s2">to actually make a cell and so you put</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.199" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">two sperm together</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.640" end="01:19:50.159" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna get something zippy</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:50.480" style="s2">that can&#39;t actually persist for very</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.159" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">long</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.480" end="01:19:53.679" style="s2">can&#39;t and can&#39;t divide and grow it just</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.719" end="01:19:56.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.679" end="01:19:57.760" style="s2">the mitochondria and the just the</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.320" end="01:19:58.800" style="s2">ribosomes it doesn&#39;t have all the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.760" end="01:20:02.880" style="s2">it needs</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:04.719" style="s2">so half of half of your supremely lonely</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.880" end="01:20:06.719" style="s2">squamates say snakes and lizards that</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.719" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">end up alone on an island are still out</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.719" end="01:20:09.280" style="s2">of luck</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:10.639" style="s2">and half of them if they&#39;re male and</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.280" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">half of them if they&#39;re female may</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.639" end="01:20:18.080" style="s2">actually be able to</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:20.480" style="s2">um to turn that into a reproductive wind</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.080" end="01:20:22.639" style="s2">so your your biological essentialism on</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.480" end="01:20:25.440" style="s2">this point is liable to get you accused</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.639" end="01:20:26.239" style="s2">of being a transphobe and i should say</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.440" end="01:20:28.120" style="s2">that&#39;s happened before</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.239" end="01:20:29.920" style="s2">i will stand by you because i am not</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.120" end="01:20:33.440" style="s2">transphobophobic</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.920" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">um i am trans activist phobic</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.440" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:37.920" style="s2">yeah watching how they have uh treated</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:41.040" style="s2">jk rowling and others</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.920" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">um but in any case uh yeah is there more</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:44.800" style="s2">to say about</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:46.880" style="s2">um parkland genesis i mean yes i</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.800" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">obviously i could go on forever but we</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.880" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">should stop all right yes maybe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">reached that point okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:55.920" style="s2">so we will return in 15 minutes</p>
