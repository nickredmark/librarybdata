<p begin="00:00:02.320" end="00:00:05.440" style="s2">medium for artful and experimental</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.560" end="00:00:07.359" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.440" end="00:00:08.559" style="s2">that seek to share insight into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.359" end="00:00:10.480" style="s2">nature of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.559" end="00:00:13.120" style="s2">culture and our relationship to an</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.480" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">evolving world at the turn of an age</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.120" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s part of a broader culture-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:17.760" style="s2">vision to build wiser pathways to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">connection and collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.760" end="00:00:21.439" style="s2">and more effective protocols for sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:24.320" style="s2">making and generative</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.439" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">meaningful and healthy interaction there</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.320" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">are breadcrumbs to follow</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">if you look</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:34.800" style="s2">this is the kind of conversation i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:35.680" style="s2">been working probably like five years to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.800" end="00:00:38.160" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.680" end="00:00:39.440" style="s2">you know um which is an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.160" end="00:00:40.640" style="s2">effort to put in for some friends that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.440" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">you haven&#39;t met</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.640" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">but um thank you much appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">so look i mean i see these um recordings</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">i&#39;m starting to see them it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">bit of a weird mixture of of um</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">kind of like a friendship sort of joy</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:02.000" style="s2">but then also a sort of serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:03.280" style="s2">ceremonial element</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.000" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">because we could just be having this</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.280" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">conversation not recorded and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">you know it leads me to consider well</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the purpose of this it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:12.159" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">not very much content on the internet so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.159" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a bit of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">and so to what degree can we create</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">something beautiful and helpful</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">in a way that speaks not only to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:22.880" style="s2">imminence of what&#39;s between us here but</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">that actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.880" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">serves as a some sort of beneficial and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.439" style="s2">helpful artifact</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">so in that sense it&#39;s um very much an</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">ongoing experimental</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">process with the context of a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.200" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">itself but also with</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:38.240" style="s2">um obviously this being recorded with</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:40.960" style="s2">video as well and um</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">how this fits into a broader life</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.960" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">of fundamentally extending the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:49.119" style="s2">invitations for people to participate</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">in we can say broadly processes of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.119" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:54.320" style="s2">sense-making in ways that aren&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2"> as perhaps we&#39;ve grown to engage</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">in them</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">these days so you know between us</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like a great interest in young</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">and um i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.680" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">with the slightly more esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.920" style="s2">um and a cultural slant on things this</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">is something i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.920" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">something of an interest in but take</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.200" style="s2">myself to be sort of you know an</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">interested student in these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:21.520" style="s2">although with respect to young i&#39;ve i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.520" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">somewhat more and i feel its influence</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">on my way of making sense to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">significant in many regards and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">other thing as well is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">i see these as opportunities to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">really see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">essentially further our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">together in the way of synergy</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">you know so we can think about that from</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">an alchemical lens or</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">just a straightforward synergetic lens</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">we can see what comes of our whole of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:49.120" style="s2">perception if we manage to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">share and really hear in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.120" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">furthers what it is we can&#39;t sense about</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">the world and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">crystallize it into so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">you know it&#39;s probably um helpful in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">particular to the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:06.560" style="s2">listening and not viewing to place</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">names to voices and perhaps just to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">very brief like just a couple minute</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">introductions but let&#39;s not do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">in in a boring way um i can say a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">bit i can say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">um eric you&#39;re someone who i came across</p>

<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">here on the podcast as opposed to why i</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">presence of people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">understand deaf psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">you know cognitive psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">evolutionary psychology in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">can challenge the conclusions that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">come to so that i can</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">further my understanding because much of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.600" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">learning about jungian ideas is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">alone and you know alone is an</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">interesting thing to really think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">if you really understand what jung is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:29.680" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">but um i&#39;m really excited to offer</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.680" end="00:05:34.400" style="s2">what i believe and then to have it be</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.400" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">and um to hear how you two see it as</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">well so i can</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">see what arises</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">uh no i did really thoroughly enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">last time um</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">i guess similarly i mean you know we</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">were talking about this a bit at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">outset</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">and you know i have i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">a sort of a boundless interest in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">young in a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">but but young has occupied so much of my</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">um and yet despite the fact that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">read his work many times there are still</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">passages that are um</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">if not quite opaque in a state of sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">of ongoing unfolding revelation</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:31.919" style="s2">you know things that i get more out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.919" end="00:06:36.560" style="s2">you know similarly you know operating as</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:38.080" style="s2">kind of an auto didact and reading this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.560" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">stuff on your own i feel is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.080" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">kind of a time-honored tradition almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">in this sort of work</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">but at the same time there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">like jung says right there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">chemical reaction</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">that happens between people um</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">consciously and unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">and you know i think any opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:56.080" style="s2">talk to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">smart interesting people about things</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.080" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">that strike me as being</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">really important and and essential to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">what it means to be human and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">and what&#39;s going on in general um is</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">always a treat</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">uh you know i um often have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">opportunity to talk about this stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">of course you know i&#39;m very often</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">teaching it so it&#39;s it&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">giving my interpretations and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t back and forth but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">again it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just a really cool opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">talk to to people that are sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">deep enthusiasts and and and are working</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">right instead of just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">overviewing it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">so yeah so i&#39;m looking forward to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">chemical reactions i guess is what i</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">yeah something to pick up on immediately</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">from both of what you&#39;re saying there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">this relationship between understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">and working with</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">jungian ideas with depth psychology more</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">broadly</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">and then doing it in isolation versus</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">doing it with others</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">um which speaks to so if we if we take</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">an understanding that the psyche is some</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">relationship a dynamic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">parts that are in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">evolving growth like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">solar system like relationship i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">heard you describe it kind of anderson</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">at least with respect to the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">of the self</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">that we have this dynamic relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:23.440" style="s2">of parts and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">how how to how to relate to that in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.440" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">social context because when we show up</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">in group situations</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s often the case that someone&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">this kind of vibe someone&#39;s got that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">kind of vibe</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">what is it like to recognize ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">in others</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">and is there a way of actually optimally</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">coming into relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">where we can come to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">and each other so yeah it strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">something that&#39;s quite resonant to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">this sort of podcast and project as well</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">because what we do see more broadly in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">society i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:09:00.560" style="s2">is a breakdown of effective ways to come</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">together as</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.560" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">communities the socio technology of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">being together</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">along with the psycho technology of how</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:12.480" style="s2">we relate to our</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">inner sort of worlds so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.480" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">for me why</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">one of the reasons why this is such a um</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:20.880" style="s2">you know why i&#39;m so enthusiastic about</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">seeing what can come</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.880" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">of um of these kinds of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">yeah absolutely yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">so eric i know that um you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">are a coach working with aubry marcus</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">and various places and i&#39;ve i know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:42.560" style="s2">the project is sort of called</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">fit first service um please correct me</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.560" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">if i&#39;m wrong about any of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:47.839" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense in which there</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">you&#39;re working with large groups of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:50.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">in a sort of semi you know even though</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.880" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">it&#39;s for a short period of time a semi</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">sort of tribal like</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">setting where it&#39;s about getting people</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">into a kind of right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">of becoming with each other i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">wondering</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">the degree to which your sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">of um jung even has come through in</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">those kind of environments</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">100 so um the context of fit for service</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">is it&#39;s a year-long program and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">create a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">curriculum each year and the curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:26.000" style="s2">this year is the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">and so we&#39;re using um the 12 stages of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.000" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">as is understood by joseph campbell</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:32.800" style="s2">which most people</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know but i&#39;m sure both of you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.800" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">you know the roots of that came from</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if he specifically</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:40.480" style="s2">called it the hero&#39;s journey but the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">that i understand it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.480" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">it seems to be the archetypical story of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">how the psyche goes through</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">transformations</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to like what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">is and again one of my favorite reasons</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">why i love to coach is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">transmitting an idea to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">their body will tell you instantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">whether or not what you are saying is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">resonating with them</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s this constant tuning that</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">archetype or structure to people really</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">it&#39;s teaching them like these are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">steps that you have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">to be able to actually connect with</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:53.839" style="s2">people because it connects you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:55.120" style="s2">who you are authentically and then gives</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.839" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">you the courage to step out of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.120" end="00:12:58.880" style="s2">quote-unquote ordinary world which is</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.880" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">and then what i am finding is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">by giving people that framework and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:10.880" style="s2">giving them the opportunity to connect</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:11.519" style="s2">like the magic and the healing that is</p>

<p begin="00:13:11.519" end="00:13:15.839" style="s2">within the container is more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">than anything that the coaches</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.839" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">could consciously articulate or enact</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">am i allowed to ask questions i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">want to uh i don&#39;t want to like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">blow out the secret level on your</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">workshop</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">let&#39;s go okay okay so i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">i&#39;m curious because um</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">yeah uh so so you know the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">the hero&#39;s journey right</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">is probably maybe got even more</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">popular penetration maybe than like jung</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">himself right</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s one of those things that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">it&#39;s been it&#39;s been dominating hollywood</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">uh since star wars and because of star</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">wars</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">um but you know it has it has lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">currency like it&#39;s a pretty standard</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">um here in canada anyway they teach it</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">in english classes right in high school</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">it&#39;s one of these like lenses</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">that you you often use um</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">when you when you work with people with</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">it and i&#39;m thinking about this from sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">of a therapeutic lens and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">a pretty strong family resemblance</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">between sort of therapeutic work and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">coaching work</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">um when people go to work with</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">it what do they do</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">like how do they how do they code it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">like do they work with it dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">or are they just like getting a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">a grasp of the stages and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">mapping life events in like do you find</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.480" style="s2">that people differ</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">in ways that they yeah yeah so it for</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.480" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">currently is b where they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.839" style="s2">getting the overview and then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">mapping life events onto it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.839" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">what i would love is to get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">i understand it well enough where i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">put them through dramas because i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:02.720" style="s2">that that would be even more powerful to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">help people and i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.720" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">the psychological function of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">is to put people through dramas that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">actually help them either embody</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">physically or body energetically new</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">modes of being</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">that will that they can then bring to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">their ordinary life that can help them</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:20.399" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:21.440" style="s2">be heroic quote unquote um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.399" end="00:15:23.920" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.440" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">simply giving people that framework it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.920" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">like their psyche will begin to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">the work on its own to help them</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">see like oh this is the obstacle right</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">or oh this is the way through the</p>

<p begin="00:15:58.399" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">there are a few</p>

<p begin="00:16:52.800" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">looked at when we&#39;ve in between that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">work and working with students is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">precisely that that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">giving the dramatic narrative space to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">embody</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">heroism and and sort of doing a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">proxy thing where you can if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.240" style="s2">subtle about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">symbolize issues in certain ways right</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.240" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">um so if you have a population that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">know has</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">somewhat shared issues there are things</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">code in a sense into the drama that</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:23.679" style="s2">reflect or emulate so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">really really interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.679" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s uh the thing is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:29.200" style="s2">shockingly effective and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:31.679" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.200" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;m surprised because it&#39;s an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.679" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">participatory art form and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">i think it&#39;s running on the source code</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:38.640" style="s2">of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.960" style="s2">the consciousness organization principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.640" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">but um but nevertheless it&#39;s surprising</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.960" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">um when it does take there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">something really um</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">striking about it um okay i do have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">and and uh i&#39;m interested to get your</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">your take because this is something i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">considered at lengths and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">young has some things to say about but i</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">still consider it a bit of a mystery and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in this this vein</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.320" end="00:18:06.160" style="s2">what do you think it is about</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.320" style="s2">explicating for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.160" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">in in these kinds of terms that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.320" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">something that&#39;s structurally archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">for them that catalyzes that action</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">because we in a sense i mean you know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">we believe that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">archetypal and that they&#39;re sort of part</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">foundation of the way our our minds our</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">psyches are organized right</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">right and we in a sense just do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">because we can do it not consciously</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">what do you think it is about</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">about laying it out in conscious terms</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">that that can gel or catalyze</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.679" style="s2">action i mean obviously there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">ideas in there potentially but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.679" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">curious you thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">so my intuition is um when</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">ever i see research or i study um</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">animals in captivity or animals that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">have been domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">um they show a level</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">so like animals that are domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">show symptoms of neurosis and mental</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">illness that no wild animals show</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">and also um no wild animals show</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">evidence of ptsd but domestic</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">animals do show um symptoms of ptsd</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">and my intuition is that uh culture has</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">gotten to a point</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">where we live inside of boxes inside of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">boxes inside of boxes looking at boxes</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">a city is a box that keeps out nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">and then we live inside of a house that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">is a box that keeps out nature and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">we live inside of a room</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">that is a box that keeps out nature and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">then we look through a screen which is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">box that keeps out nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">and it feels like uh there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">layers of cement of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">conditioning because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">the greatest storytellers in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the most sacred like act</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">that a person can have in a tribe we</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">live in a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">the greatest storytellers are</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">corporations and they&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">tell stories</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">that like the elders were trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">around fires</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">and so i think we live in a population</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">where the majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">are essentially domestic domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">animals who don&#39;t even know what their</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">instincts feel like and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">articulating what seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">a story that represents like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">the instinct to growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">it almost needs to be transmuted in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">language to these creatures that are so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">disconnected from their instincts that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">the only thing that they&#39;ve learned how</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">to really interact with is their mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">and language</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">yeah uh this really plugs into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">i have something of a running critique</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">of of disney and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">don&#39;t get me wrong i like disney movies</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">as much as anybody they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">entertaining</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">um but i have a running critique of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">disney about</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">how essentially speaking they you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve not just battlerized myths uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">and fairy tales</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">but they&#39;ve sort of weaponized them uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">in in an important sense and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">gotten</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">very good at doing this it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">reasons that freaks me out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">you know like i i alluded to with with</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">star wars</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">i have a i have a very strong opinion</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.559" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">about star wars i&#39;m i&#39;m a 70s child so</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s my religion in some ways my</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">childhood religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">um and uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">and of course star wars did something</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">really specific right which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">it explicitly took the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:37.840" style="s2">and it applied it in a way that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">expected this movie about weird robots</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.840" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">and hairy monsters and laser swords to</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">an international cultural phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">right um</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">the producers didn&#39;t expect that george</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">lucas didn&#39;t expect that the actors</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect it right</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">um and yet it became this huge thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">basically because</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">it it applied this structure i do</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">sometimes worry</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">actually um this is my concern that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:02.080" style="s2">you know in the way that other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.480" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">mythological representations and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.080" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">cultures can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">um worn down right overdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">um that it&#39;s possible to come i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">know you&#39;re sort of pointing out right</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">the storyteller around the fire</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">um or at a certain time of year you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like now is you know when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">pole star is at its highest and so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">is when we tell this story</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">um and instead what we have is like here</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">is a story that has this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">recognizable emotional transference</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">thing when we run it for you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">and now we&#39;re going to run it over and</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">over and over and over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:39.039" style="s2">and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">um so i worry about that stuff sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.039" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">myths can always slough that off</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.840" end="00:22:46.480" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">emerge french but at the same time um</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.480" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">you know i sometimes do worry about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">idea that yeah the big storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">powers</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.919" style="s2">um have really sort of turned or</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">attempted to turn myth into a crank</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.919" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:04.400" style="s2">for right you know yeah so anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">what i find is important and powerful is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.400" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">when you only use language to transfer</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">the story</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">in the absence of making the person</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:14.559" style="s2">um absorb the image that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">providing</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.559" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">you allow their psyche to provide the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">image in their imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:23.280" style="s2">and that is in a sense like a waking</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">dream and so it becomes personal</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.280" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">it can slouch off the concrete of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">corporatization of this myth</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">and so i find that if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">give it to people in person through</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">language alone</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">that their psyche is able to put the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.159" style="s2">flesh on the bones</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:44.240" style="s2">as opposed to if you&#39;re watching a movie</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.159" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">the flesh is being provided for you by</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.240" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">the images and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">musical score behind it and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">i think that that is one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">that the myth can stay alive and not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">prostituted by you know these entities</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">their primary goal is to make money</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">yeah um something that comes to me also</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">there are many myths you know and um</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear to me that i&#39;ve even</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:22.080" style="s2">um breed breathe them all</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">in and out to the same degree right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.080" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">this speaks to the point about how</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.919" style="s2">movies might be co-opting</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">me or us in various ways by preventing</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">by presenting some</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">rather than others and almost treating</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">relationship like just another box and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">there&#39;s part of me that&#39;s always wanting</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">to push beyond the edge of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:44.320" style="s2">and so it&#39;d be a tragic thing for</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">example to have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.320" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">the hero&#39;s myth be something that just</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">enables people to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">get their stimulation and kicks to</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">essentially stay where they are and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:55.520" style="s2">fundamentally not end up participating</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.520" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">which makes me think of um the uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">i&#39;m more fuller context of actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">participation and embodiment which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:09.200" style="s2">more akin to what you&#39;re speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">various kind of coaching processes</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about eric that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">but i&#39;m also interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">relationship between different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">myths like as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">as a male i think i&#39;ve been more</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">more typically male myths but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.000" end="00:25:29.120" style="s2">also interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">female myths of our time and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.120" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">well what if we have to create new myths</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">right which is a which is a tough thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">to say when it comes to jung in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">respects because</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:42.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a skepticism regarding the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.960" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">archetypes can be created at all rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">than just merely</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">re-particularized but i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">presence this in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">this other sort of complex concept which</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">is might be some sort of idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">in nature and emergency in culture we</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.919" style="s2">might say the technological</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">emergence we&#39;re experiencing at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.919" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">moment this creation of new channels of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">the ubiquity of information but how</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">difficult it is to process it and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">the various ways we&#39;re being hacked by</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">algorithms to present to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:18.240" style="s2">what the algorithms will sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">find you know think we&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.240" end="00:26:21.039" style="s2">most relevant so that we can continue to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.039" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">do the consuming thing so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">to what degree um could even</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:32.240" style="s2">the myths that have been so powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">us no longer serve us</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.240" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">i mean i know i&#39;ve put like four or five</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">things into the fourth there so</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">please like just pick one or pick what</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">pops out to you at all from all of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:45.520" style="s2">i have sort of three loosely connected</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.520" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">you know considering all that stuff i</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">sort of think in in i guess a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">different axes right so i think along</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">the line of time um and sort of into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:01.679" style="s2">the future into the past but like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">line of time and beyond sort of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.679" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">immediate time</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">and i think about sort of scale um you</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">know scaling it up to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">uh extent and then and then and then i</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">think of it in terms of i guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">the the terminal versus the cyclical so</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">so in terms of like time well no</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s do scale first in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:25.520" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">you know i think about some of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.520" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">technologies of connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">you know facebook social media whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:32.399" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">the evidence of course seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.399" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">mounting up that they&#39;re of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">cross-connecting us not just consciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:42.159" style="s2">but uh unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">um and it&#39;s the unconscious effects um</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">that that you begin to really see at</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:46.840" style="s2">scale so</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">the way i&#39;ve been thinking about it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.840" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">like when we built the internal</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">combustion engine</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">right what did we think we were getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">we thought we were getting personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">transport</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">personal transport and convenience</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what we thought and we built</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">these machines and we put a billion of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.120" style="s2">them on the planet and we all thought we</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">were in the age of happy motoring</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.120" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">getting around</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">but at scale that&#39;s not what we built</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">what we built was a terraforming engine</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">to turn our planet into venus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">what we actually built</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">right that&#39;s what we actually built</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s only at the limited scale that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">it looks like the age of happy motoring</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">right so when i think about technologies</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">and i think about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">i i have speculated a bunch lately that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">in a way</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">a lot of these cross-connecting</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">technologies initially</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">you know you think about the the 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">wired vision</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:43.919" style="s2">utopian vision you know of what the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:45.200" style="s2">internet was going to be and it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.919" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">going to connect us together</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">and it did that until we got the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">recognition on the algorithms up to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">point when they began to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">predictive</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">right predictive intrusions into right</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">and when we monetize the tension in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">very fine-grained way</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">right and then what has the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">that well what we think the impact is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">get this feed of that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">interested in right</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">just like like a goose with one of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">feeding tubes</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">um for foie gras but what they actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.799" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">got if you pull back from scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">is a machine that seems to be raising</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">the global emotional temperature</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">mostly by siloing people and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">feeding them</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.880" style="s2">whatever outrage they happen to already</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">agree with it was a very tight</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.880" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">way right so so there&#39;s kind of a scope</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">and scale thing and i often wonder about</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">what that</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">means in a sense archetypally is there</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:41.440" style="s2">is there like a hot house archetype here</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">that is maybe a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.440" end="00:29:44.799" style="s2">thing in some sense right right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">maybe sort of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.799" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">in a new way that didn&#39;t quite exist</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">before because the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">the the technology wasn&#39;t there so i</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">when i think about the timeline aspect</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">you know from that perspective it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">i think clear that that jung at least in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">late young</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">did intend for a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">historical evolution so if you look in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">ion his book ion or i think a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:16.159" style="s2">sharply in answer to job right</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">answer to job is a fascinating little</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.159" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">book right because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:21.039" style="s2">it looks at the story of job so you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.679" style="s2">the book of job in the bible</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">is uh you know this wager that takes</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.679" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">place between god and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">and the devil when the devil was still</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">an employee and not an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">and they&#39;re both sort of sitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">cliff side and the devil&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">hey your servant job seems quite pious</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">and god&#39;s like yup and then uh he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">i bet you if i absolutely destroy this</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">guy i can get him to renounce you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">and god basically you know says you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">on uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">ten bucks for the winner kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">and so they they then proceed right he</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">allows the adversary to do this and he</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">just crushes this guy&#39;s life right he</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">kills his children and robs him as far</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">all this stuff and then you get to this</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:01.760" style="s2">final scene and in the final scene</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">you know god appears and job has of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">course the temerity</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:06.799" style="s2">to just for one instance sort of say</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.799" end="00:31:10.080" style="s2">why does this have to happen anyway</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.720" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">basically right</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.080" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">god freaks out he freaks out this is old</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:16.399" style="s2">testament god</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">you know full throated and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.399" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">says uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">you know where where where worse now</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">when i laid the foundations of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.039" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">can&#39;t thou drop leviathan with a hook</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">like he really he&#39;s like i&#39;m god who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:29.120" style="s2">you i&#39;m god</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">and y&#39;all&#39;s interpretation of that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.120" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">think is so</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">um interesting it&#39;s heretical but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">which is that that event you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">sort of the the two halves of the bible</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">right old testament to new testament</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">but that&#39;s the event that produces in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">sense in god</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">guilt god feels ashamed for what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.960" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">now if we think about that in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">jungian terms as he was right then what</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about is the self the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">archetype of the self and its</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">relationship to the ego</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">in some deeply collective sense suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">undergoing a kind of moment of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">consciousness which is supposed to be at</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">the whole heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">of what the encounter between the ego</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">and all the other architects is right we</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">lend them consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">that&#39;s why they all want our attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:14.480" style="s2">that&#39;s why we matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.720" style="s2">and so the self sort of has this moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.480" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">of consciousness where it stops being a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.720" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">capricious tyrannical and feels</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">bad enough that in young&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">interpretation that&#39;s what then</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">precipitates the incarnation</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">god has to then incarnate right so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">he can take on sufferings</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">so that he knows what&#39;s going on on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">ground like</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know and obviously right</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">theological and interpretive and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">hermeneutic you know objections that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">can bring to this</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.960" style="s2">but at the heart of it that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">interesting example for sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.960" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">hinge</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s in the bible right this</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">transition this transition between this</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.480" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">this angry plague tossing</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">smashing quite capricious sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">good-natured</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">being and this like god of love who we</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:04.240" style="s2">see in uh right it&#39;s very greek</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">we see in the in the new testament in</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.240" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">christ&#39;s incarnation so</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">just right there young is really</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.679" style="s2">pointing at something in an eye on</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">more broadly right and he&#39;s pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.679" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">these sort of transitions</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">that are occurring where the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">seemingly you know in in a collective</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">sort of merely cosmetic or or minor</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">and you know whatever we could argue all</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">day about how much</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">the interaction between architect and</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">culture but</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:37.279" style="s2">yeah and then the third thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">strikes me and this is something i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">is which will kind of pitch out there i</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">um so archetypes are cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">right that&#39;s in their nature um that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">they that they follow a cycle it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">thing that makes them somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">predictable they&#39;re sort of circular</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:56.159" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">um in the way that time used to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.159" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">circular for humans</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:00.720" style="s2">right rather than linear so it was you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">know the the cycle and the procession of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.720" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">the equinoxes and all that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">jazz right there was a circularity and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:10.720" style="s2">archetypes are very circular</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.039" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">um and so i wonder sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.720" end="00:34:14.399" style="s2">what it means for the circularity of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">archetypes and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.399" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">how they help us predict things in our</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">lives that we might be coming up on</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">sort of a massive historical</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:26.079" style="s2">that things might be actually really</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">changing like in a radical way</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.079" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">fairly soon and you know we can take our</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">pick i keep one toe in the like kurtz</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">violin</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">um transcend in a machine consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">pool but i&#39;m thinking mostly here about</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">climate change right and the potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">in the same way as animals which are</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">essentially cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">can&#39;t change as the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">conditions change i sort of wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">it means</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">like whether our myths are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">to run a gauntlet because they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">predictive and of course we have myths</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">for that right phoenix and rebirth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:03.520" style="s2">wow okay so so many things came up that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">i want to touch on um i have a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.520" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">things that came up</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">when tim first asked the question but i</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">really want to explore</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">one thing for a moment it is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">revolutionary idea to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">to to really connect to the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">that could the ego react to the self in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">such a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">that it fundamentally changes the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">the self is</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">you know guiding or orchestrating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">ego&#39;s life and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:35.200" style="s2">maybe it requires a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">uh the ego contesting the self</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.200" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">that would precipitate that but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">if you use the story of job as the map</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">that you know because most people at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:48.160" style="s2">beginning of their</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">quote unquote transformational journey</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.160" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">they are fighting against the self but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">it seems like it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">earned through suffering the ability or</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:57.760" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">piousness and then suffering the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.760" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">space to</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.320" style="s2">question the self in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">would create guilt in the self</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.320" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s a really interesting idea that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to think about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">is that can the ego get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">where it&#39;s earned the right to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">potentially maybe critique the self in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">way that can transform the self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">that&#39;s radical and very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">me the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">couple of things that came up when tim</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">first asked the question is</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.480" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">i imagine the psyche on one level as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">like the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">and to try to keep it down through</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">anything is like trying to pour cement</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:37.040" style="s2">on top of the ocean like good</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">luck</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">and um what i find in my community so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">a lot of people that i know they do</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">things like ayahuasca</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">and mushrooms with intention and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">inside of containers that have been</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">honed for thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">and in the same way that dreams at times</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">like my intuition is that it it were</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">dreams and visionary states that produce</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">all myths</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:05.440" style="s2">that have ever arisen into the space of</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:07.839" style="s2">ever being able to be articulated</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.440" end="00:37:09.839" style="s2">that that function is still alive in</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">every single human on this planet and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.839" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">are all watching</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">and we are all paying attention and all</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">all of our cells</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">inside of us capital s cells we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">watching what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:23.359" style="s2">and people are having dreams and people</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">are having visionary experiences</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.359" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">and i believe that whatever archetype</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">needs to arise to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">adaptability</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">of the collective psyche it will come</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">but do we have the ability to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:39.839" style="s2">whoever the people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.880" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">and do we create containers for people</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.839" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">to even be able to hold that space and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">be able to articulate those stories in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">way where we don&#39;t give them</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that numb them and put</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:51.280" style="s2">them inside of boxes you know like</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">do we even have the cultural container</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.280" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">to allow for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">profits you know like that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">interesting thing to feel into</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">um and i also do agree that</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">it feels like once the rise of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:10.880" style="s2">internet happened that it connected</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">psyche in a way that was completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.880" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">unknown and has never been known before</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">and my intuition is like in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">personal ego goes through its</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">transformation where like in</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">early teenage years that&#39;s when the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">shadow becomes kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">like that&#39;s when it comes into full</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">force and the ego doesn&#39;t quite know how</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">to contend with it and there&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">volatile behaviors that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">hopefully a integration can come in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:41.119" style="s2">20s or 30s and for people that have</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">midlife crises because they&#39;ve ignored</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.119" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">it for 20 years then it comes up again</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">and my feeling is that on a collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">level we&#39;re like a 16 year old</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">like with the rising of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">within the last 30 years like we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">just beginning to truly contend with our</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">shadow</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">and right now it feels you know like how</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">a parent probably feels about their 18</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">year old who is just completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">rebelling</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">and there&#39;s just anger and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">my intuition um and i skewed to optimism</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">is that there is going and we are in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:16.960" style="s2">midst</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.599" style="s2">of like that revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.960" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.599" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">psyche and that my hope</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">is that new myths will arise and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">will have platforms and they will able</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:28.079" style="s2">to be heard and they will like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">so many independent people</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.079" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">making independent art that you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:33.839" style="s2">hoping that there will be a star wars of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:35.680" style="s2">our time</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.839" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">that instead of being created by a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.680" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">corporation is created by an independent</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:41.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">is so unique that completely resonates</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.359" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">with whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">story needs to be heard right now that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">will allow people to contend with</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.240" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">the issues that are arising</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">beautiful let me let me make one</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.119" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">meta sort of meta reflection on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">dynamics of the conversation so far</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">okay so we began with this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">introduced you guys open the space we</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:08.960" style="s2">shared some intentions we began talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">a bit of a flow starts to develop and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.960" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">then i</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">in the last time i spoke i put like</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">oh this is uh this is a fire alarm here</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.800" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna beat myself for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">so the uh jungian and so okay i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">labeled the part inside of me that has</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">completely downloaded the weirdness of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">young and synchronicity and all that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">thing and i call her evie</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">and like that part of me whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:40.960" style="s2">were about</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">to say was interrupting whatever was</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.960" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">wanting to come out that it created a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">synchronicity around you that kept</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">you from bringing forth that idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">laugh that comes up out of me</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">well it&#39;s finished now</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:03.520" style="s2">i can bring it back i can bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">and the point was really to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.520" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">to actually to introduce a bit of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">so so i put about four ideas on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">and i can imagine the listening</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">experience for some people was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">whoa but then anderson was able to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">take some of that raw material crafted</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">into some points which he might not have</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">otherwise in that particular instance</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">and then now we reflect on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">and we continue speaking but i&#39;m raising</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">this because there&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">this is part of the collective art</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">process and there&#39;s different roles to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">play in the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">generativity and conversation itself so</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">if i was with</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">other people speaking i wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">said those kinds of things right</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:54.079" style="s2">there&#39;s times when um i might have to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">the one providing a more steady flow of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">coherence</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">but in this context because of who i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">with i can play a certain role</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">that then enables the whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.480" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">conversation to become more</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">so for people listening and just because</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">this is sort of in resonance with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:08.800" style="s2">broader scope of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">project and i think also what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">speaking about in a very interesting way</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">an understanding of the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">communication and the different roles we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">play in it i think is deeply part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">speaking about here if we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like different instrumentation</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">and if we can come to the right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">bass track if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">introduce the right instruments and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">maybe we can add one or two people</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">and then there&#39;s already the kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">the fellowship of players there we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">add one in and all of a sudden then</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">does that provide a context for</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">something radically new</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">to actually presence itself in a safe</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">way and then be caught</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">you know just like a moment of insight</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">it might just be to the void</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">might be back into the chaos but if</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">there&#39;s some people there who can pick</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">and bring it on well then maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">something deeply worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:07.520" style="s2">um i find that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">in these kinds of spaces and i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously it&#39;s very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">conversational despite the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">the you know relative focus but the ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">that i find most pleasing and maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">speaks</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">actually to what we&#39;re already talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">about with these cycles i love the ones</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">where there are like</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">two or three dozen untracked</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">insightful jewels that get fired out the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.000" style="s2">side and you&#39;ll ah we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.000" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">uh but then inexplicably you end up back</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">where you started without i once had a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">conversation that started on the topic</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:41.920" style="s2">of lobsters went for like three hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">and then ended on lobsters and it was so</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.920" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">beautiful and it was not like</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">it was not a move we just got there you</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">know in this spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:53.200" style="s2">um way um</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:55.040" style="s2">and you know and spontaneity is a big</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.200" end="00:43:57.680" style="s2">part of it um</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.040" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important with something</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.680" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">like this that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">you know that well i mean you know none</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">of us can feel too</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">guarded right there has to be that open</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:09.839" style="s2">um probably helps i imagine we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">quite high openness</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.839" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">um right so having that kind of thing uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">land makes a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:22.400" style="s2">um yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">i was just thinking about about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.400" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">process and then also thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">this this business of sort of the ego</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">pushing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">pushing back and um pushing back against</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:36.400" style="s2">the self</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">and you know i think wrestling with god</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.400" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">or wrestling with angels is like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">like an honest part of the work</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">right i don&#39;t think you can get too deep</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">into thinking about stuff without</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">having some serious beef with the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">creator</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">in the state of affairs like worse or i</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">think you&#39;re maybe not looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">deeply enough and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">part of that is sort of shadow work and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">realizing like the shadow goes all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">way up and all the way down right</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.640" style="s2">that that god is not simply nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">um and that and that the universe is not</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">simply nice it&#39;s often nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s possible to make it nicer and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">can always appreciate things and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">and so forth and there are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">threads to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">found but also it&#39;s got teeth um and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">as i once told the students and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">immediately regretted it i was teaching</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:22.720" style="s2">in high school</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">uh that it has bones of crystallized</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.720" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">um which i think was a bit much for her</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">um you know so so i think about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">the wrestling piece um</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">so this is what i&#39;m thinking sorry i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.280" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">kind of a little all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain kind of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">happens often in these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">conversations which is like there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">of a weaving and a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">something there&#39;s like backup and spark</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">and weaving right</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s very different than state</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.440" style="s2">debate</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">where you have the the confrontational</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.440" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">aspect right</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">and uh when you do have debates i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:45:59.440" style="s2">watching the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">fragments of the us debate and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.440" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">clear that debates mean what they used</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">but um you know i sometimes wonder about</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:11.680" style="s2">what the sort of exchanges between those</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.599" style="s2">things like is it is a weave and a flow</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.680" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">can that get you everywhere do you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">to do you think have wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:19.119" style="s2">does there need to be conflict like how</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:23.760" style="s2">do those things fit together</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.119" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">and yes yeah i mean i think so</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.760" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">you know at the same time i&#39;m i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">interested in like the anti-debate</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">as a concept right which is like uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">rather than just trying to like get your</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">opponent with points</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:38.000" style="s2">you form you know steel man versions of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">what they&#39;re saying and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.000" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">really to to create a collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">effort and i think sometimes obviously</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">our adversarial process</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">loses sight of that um</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">yeah my intuition here</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">is that um you don&#39;t need classic</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">debates</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2">anymore but what i do think is required</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">do you have the courage</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">and the clarity to feel inside of you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.240" style="s2">that when something is said do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.240" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">have where you currently are a different</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">can you articulate it clearly with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:16.880" style="s2">intention</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:18.880" style="s2">of co-creating greater clarity</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.880" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">with the people that you are with and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.880" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">like the way that i imagine it is like</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">if we&#39;re co-weaving a fabric</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">but my genius and me truly sees like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the wrong pattern there</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:31.119" style="s2">can we deconstruct it can we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:33.200" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.119" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s felt that it doesn&#39;t fit what was</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.200" end="00:47:36.720" style="s2">unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">and then can we co-weave together but</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.720" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">it&#39;s why i love podcasts and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">like podcasts have transformed the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">that i speak to people</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">and the way that i speak to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:50.800" style="s2">now is i&#39;m genuinely trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:53.440" style="s2">feel what is the what is the cloth</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.800" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">the weaving that they are presenting me</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.440" end="00:47:57.599" style="s2">is there anything that i genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:48:00.079" style="s2">feel i can learn from their cloth as</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.599" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">it&#39;s being presented to add to my cloth</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.079" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">and then is there anything that i</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">genuinely feel i can add to their cloth</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">to help move towards the felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">where i</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">feel they&#39;re trying to make their cloth</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.079" style="s2">because there is this intuition in me</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.079" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">damon or the daimon depending on who you</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:21.280" style="s2">here pronounce it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">that in the same way that every acorn</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.280" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">knows what it&#39;s trying to become every</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">on an unconscious level knows what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:32.720" style="s2">and when you&#39;re in a conversation can</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:35.200" style="s2">you feel into what they&#39;re becoming is</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.720" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">can you feel what you&#39;re becoming is and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.200" end="00:48:37.920" style="s2">then can you trust the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">something has brought the two of you</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.920" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">together and then can you be humble</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">enough to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">recognize there is something in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">being that if i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">open and i listened would fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">help me towards whatever my becoming is</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">and then me offering my truth as i see</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">it now as i feel it now</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">can help them in their becoming but the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:49:00.720" style="s2">whole idea of a debate</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">implies you already know and so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.720" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">learn nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">yeah i mean i think eric you put that so</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">beautifully i i don&#39;t think i have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">much to add to it other than um when i</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:15.200" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">you anderson i think yes i wasn&#39;t saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.200" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">yet we should just have debate it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">more it&#39;s more akin to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">the manner of um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">intention towards the whole of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">process both before and after so how do</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:28.720" style="s2">we catch each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">how do we hold each other how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.720" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">share with each other after the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">you know as well as before i see these</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">things as kind of like a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">relationship between confrontation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">surrender</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">and there are appropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">inappropriate kinds of both</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:44.079" style="s2">right so it&#39;s inappropriate for me to</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">confront if for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">i like the way you put it eric if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:50.240" style="s2">don&#39;t have the intention to bring sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">of greater clarity or otherwise sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.240" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.800" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">develop or raise the space that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">all inhabiting in some sense to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">a deep contribution to what is integris</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:05.040" style="s2">the fabric that is we&#39;re co-weaving</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">together which</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.040" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">at the same time is in some sense our</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">very coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">being in the world together um and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">the surrender piece</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">is like well sometimes you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s to to simply appreciate and be</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">moved by the flow of another and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.400" end="00:50:23.280" style="s2">sometimes uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">you you need to stop being moved by that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">flow because they&#39;re spiraling you off</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">into some sort of titrated oblivion with</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">just boxes and boxes and it&#39;s repressing</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">that creative spirit and so actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the right way</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.079" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">yeah i think a lot of it i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">that obviously there&#39;s an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.440" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">component right to sort of feeling your</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">way through</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:50.640" style="s2">right and getting a sense of where</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">you&#39;re lining up with people and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.640" end="00:50:53.839" style="s2">they have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.760" style="s2">offer and what you know how how you sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.839" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">of plug together in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.760" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">um but there&#39;s also there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">like flexibility that&#39;s required right</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">people all together too often want to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:09.760" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">one role um i used to have a friend</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.760" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">who um</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">any time we were doing something social</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">he always wanted to be the straight man</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">so i had to play the fool and this was</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">this was the dynamic that he</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">preferred right um it was a was it that</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:29.119" style="s2">we were business partners</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">and so it was this thing that we did um</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.119" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">and it was fine i i enjoy playing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">fool sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:37.440" style="s2">um he liked looking like that uh grumpy</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">eagle from the muppets</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">and like that it was a social thing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">we did right</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">but it did sometimes strike me at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">time and it&#39;s like oh my god can we</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">change this up</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">just like once or twice you know can we</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">and and i sometimes felt that lack of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.760" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">likewise many years ago uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.760" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">a a girlfriend of mine who was</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">exceptionally clever about this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:03.599" style="s2">um had pointed out to me that i very</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">often would launch into</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.599" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">uh arguments and she&#39;s like and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">even think you believe what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">are saying you just say a contrary thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:14.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">i uh was like i certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.319" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">um and uh anyway so what she did</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">she was smart she led me into this trap</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">she started arguing a point it must have</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:25.119" style="s2">been pre-planned but she started arguing</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.119" end="00:52:28.880" style="s2">and i of course took up the counterpoint</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">and then moved by move</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.880" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">she gradually shifted the nature of her</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:35.119" style="s2">argument and her position</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.319" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">until she was arguing the opposite right</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.119" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">at which point i</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">in perfect lockstep had switched to</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">arguing her original point</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">and then she was like see yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:46.960" style="s2">what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:50.240" style="s2">and and i suddenly was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.960" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">i am and like why am i doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.240" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">i i had a real deep moment of access and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">i was like why am i doing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it because it&#39;s counterpoint</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">i&#39;m doing it to play the devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">advocate because my sense is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">how one fills</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">out right not necessarily but it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">it was a revelation for me at the time</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">at 16 or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">because it was like right a a dance is</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">you know taking up the opposite position</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:16.960" style="s2">with somebody and then following them</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.000" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">move for move</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">there&#39;s something that is more</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">improvisational and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">that requires a kind of a fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">um a shift so that you can first do one</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">thing and then do</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">another um and i think the same goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">with this kind of like the contact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">the fabric right sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">things have to shift around right</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">um a little bit just to to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know catalyze the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.440" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">i love that point and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">comes up in me and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">constantly say to my friends who i can</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">um this is something that i constantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:54:01.440" style="s2">say to my friends who</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">whatever is being proposed by the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.440" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">they must believe the opposite and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:12.319" style="s2">the rebel is enslaved in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">that the slave is because the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.319" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know their true point the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.640" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">has to be the opposite of whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">thing is that&#39;s being offered</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:23.760" style="s2">and that that seems like a transitionary</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">stage to your authentic self</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.760" end="00:54:27.920" style="s2">but if you&#39;ve got a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">especially people who are very low in</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.920" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">agreeableness they just stay there</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">and um i find that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">whenever i&#39;m talking to someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:41.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">that uh i find myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.119" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">becoming the advocate trying to steal</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">man that i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">you know that&#39;s coming through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">mainstream just to give them the sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">do you see how you are not free</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">because no matter what is presented you</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">have to not believe it</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">and you think that that&#39;s you being the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">divine arbiter</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">you know like the revolutionary like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">difference between the rebel and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.720" style="s2">is that the rebel is enslaved to be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">opposite of whatever tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">but the revolutionary on some sense i</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">think in its highest aspect</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.319" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">is like a prophet that it has something</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">genuine and unique coming through it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s the advocate</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">for yeah that&#39;s right i mean the prophet</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:29.839" style="s2">you know obviously there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">tradition a prophetic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:33.200" style="s2">that has the the wild man wander out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">the desert you know with</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.200" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">long beard and a mouthful of bees and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">honey um</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">you know and and say like this is all</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">screwed up and we should stop it</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">right um but usually that</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">that comes with some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">proactive you know prescriptive</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">vision of what what needs to happen um</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">and i think yeah all together too often</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:57.520" style="s2">people um</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">especially because it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.520" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">valorized in the west</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">right the idea of rebel consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">um valorized and and you know and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something to it right</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">that there was never a change of any</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:10.559" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t first an unpopular</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.559" end="00:56:15.280" style="s2">rebellious position right and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">i think i probably said for 25 years uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.280" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">the minority</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t always right but the majority is</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:22.720" style="s2">always wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.160" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">i love it i don&#39;t i&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.720" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">in quite the same way i mean that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">kept me from doing things like um</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">i didn&#39;t wear shoes for years</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">and you know i had other things combat</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">boots and stuff but like</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.160" style="s2">i didn&#39;t wear shoes i didn&#39;t wear um</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">shorts</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.160" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">shorts were like this shockingly like i</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">wore them as a child</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:44.319" style="s2">and then as soon as i was able to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:45.119" style="s2">my own determinations i didn&#39;t wear</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.319" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">shorts</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.119" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">and i looked back on that period and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">like why did i have that strange</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">position you know what are great</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">shorts and</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a majority position like there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:59.040" style="s2">really a common wisdom about keeping</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">your legs reasonably cool in the summer</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.040" end="00:57:03.839" style="s2">so you know i i don&#39;t hold it quite as</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">strongly but by the same token</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.839" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">you know that that idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">minority isn&#39;t always right but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">majority is always wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">does carry in a certain sense because</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">you know as i sometimes say to my</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">clients it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">well it&#39;s not that way because if it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">if the majority was right then the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">would be a very different place wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:26.799" style="s2">like and the proof of the pudding is in</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">the eating you know like this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.799" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">this is what we got and this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">got from what most people believe</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">so should we continue to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">maybe not yeah i think what i i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">part of what i heard there was this</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">the wisdom of crowds and also the</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">madness of crowds</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">and i think what&#39;s most important is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">capacity to discern</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">in whatever the case is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:56.000" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">and that there&#39;s something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.000" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">really coming coming through to me here</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">when we speak about</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">vision um and fabric</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s the notion of religion it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">notion of something we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">all gather around in some sense even if</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">we want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.760" style="s2">understand that center as a wandering</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">center as a moving center could to</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.760" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">continually be</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:22.720" style="s2">re-realized and re-woven still some</p>
