<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:52.970" style="s2">behind me here is a pond that is</p>

<p begin="00:15:52.970" end="00:15:56.380" style="s2">of the building so from a high spot on</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.590" end="00:15:59.830" style="s2">the north side of the building</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.380" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">water just gravity feeds into the pond</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.830" end="00:16:06.110" style="s2">we capture roof water runoff store that</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:09.379" style="s2">in a 10,000 gallon storage tank and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.110" end="00:16:12.589" style="s2">is used to top off the pond and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.379" end="00:16:14.929" style="s2">a year right behind you is a pole the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.589" end="00:16:16.579" style="s2">shadow which can cause on markers here</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.929" end="00:16:19.849" style="s2">maybe you want to get the the markers</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.579" end="00:16:22.699" style="s2">the great concrete this is the equinoxes</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.849" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">of the year the shadow comes down this</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.699" end="00:16:27.169" style="s2">line that&#39;s and equinoxes</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:34.699" style="s2">that&#39;s the winter solstice the shortest</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.169" end="00:16:39.889" style="s2">day of the year coming up the light is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.699" end="00:16:42.229" style="s2">too faint right now we&#39;ll just walk</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.889" end="00:16:44.779" style="s2">around here this is a since we are a</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.779" end="00:16:50.199" style="s2">that pink flamingo out here</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:09.290" style="s2">really was native to this place before</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.250" end="00:17:11.709" style="s2">European settlement so the idea here was</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.290" end="00:17:11.709" style="s2">to build</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.410" end="00:17:54.419" style="s2">this area we take out invasive species</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:17:57.270" style="s2">but otherwise leave it pretty much to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.419" end="00:18:01.650" style="s2">the way it evolves so this is a replica</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.270" end="00:18:06.710" style="s2">of a wetland about 10,000 years ago the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.650" end="00:18:06.710" style="s2">plants that we reused it here actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:41.480" style="s2">is my meat is part of the orchards for</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:44.030" style="s2">the building landscape attend to your</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.480" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">right are gardens that are all student</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.030" end="00:18:49.310" style="s2">maintain but the goal here was to create</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:50.510" style="s2">a place that she&#39;s a working landscape</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.310" end="00:18:53.780" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the overall landscape</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.510" end="00:18:58.940" style="s2">design and then the photovoltaic array</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.780" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">this is a 100 kW array that&#39;s roughly</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.940" end="00:19:14.210" style="s2">enough to power say 20 or 25 homes or</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:17.119" style="s2">sign of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:18.980" style="s2">below me right here is a 10,000 gallon</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.119" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">storage tank we try to capture as much</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.980" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">of roof water runoff as we can and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:26.440" style="s2">that&#39;s used to top off the the wetland</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:29.509" style="s2">which is straight ahead we just passed</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.440" end="00:19:32.330" style="s2">on the east side of the building so try</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.509" end="00:19:34.730" style="s2">to save water on-site slow the rate at</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.330" end="00:19:36.710" style="s2">which water runs off the site and use</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.730" end="00:19:42.249" style="s2">the building as a laboratory in every</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.710" end="00:19:42.249" style="s2">way for ecological design and that&#39;s</p>
