<p begin="00:07:43.139" end="00:07:48.539" style="s2">yeah yeah what so we create gods that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.069" end="00:07:50.669" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying we create God and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.539" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">create gods and and this is a creative</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.669" end="00:07:55.139" style="s2">activity that where we participate in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:57.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not like just just we&#39;re possibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.139" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">created by some but that&#39;s that&#39;s why by</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.870" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">something and and we have to bow down to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:06.539" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s like we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:08.039" style="s2">participants and you know in the we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.539" end="00:08:09.719" style="s2">created by a nature and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.039" end="00:08:11.580" style="s2">belong to whatever we came from the</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.789" end="00:08:21.509" style="s2">think that we want to live and then we</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:23.639" style="s2">get a taste for it then we suck at it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.509" end="00:08:26.190" style="s2">for another year anyway so we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.639" end="00:08:27.719" style="s2">you know we&#39;re not on our own but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.190" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">completely taken care of the first year</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.719" end="00:08:31.229" style="s2">the tip services we have no idea where</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">that milk comes from its magical but</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.229" end="00:08:34.649" style="s2">yeah we get it</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">and maybe the false religious the false</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.649" end="00:08:40.079" style="s2">religious view is assertiveness dalchi</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:42.810" style="s2">for that tip as you&#39;re saying but well</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.079" end="00:08:45.870" style="s2">so Astron ism isn&#39;t Taoism isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.810" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">Buddhism isn&#39;t hmm that&#39;s why I went to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.870" end="00:08:49.740" style="s2">the East while I went to these was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">the fundamental religious we have in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.740" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">West all the Arabic religions are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:54.090" style="s2">based in the deal</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:02.430" style="s2">I&#39;d leave them more a fine tent for nine</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:04.380" style="s2">months yeah sure was nice but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.430" end="00:09:06.300" style="s2">take opiates two days I&#39;ve wanted to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.380" end="00:09:07.650" style="s2">there again I don&#39;t I won&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.300" end="00:09:09.180" style="s2">little bit I want to be alive I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.650" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">be passionate about things I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.180" end="00:09:12.360" style="s2">philosophy I won&#39;t have a full life I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.339" style="s2">want to be a full human being and I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.360" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">to die happy having lived a full life I</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.339" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">won&#39;t hold us I don&#39;t want to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:20.279" style="s2">more front end I find stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:23.130" style="s2">degrading from us growing up I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.279" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">longer a child okay so you left that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.130" end="00:09:26.279" style="s2">behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:29.610" style="s2">now the problem with religions that say</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.279" end="00:09:32.100" style="s2">you&#39;re the child of God you should think</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.610" end="00:09:33.870" style="s2">it can be child again and be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.100" end="00:09:36.540" style="s2">whatever you do you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.870" end="00:09:39.390" style="s2">forgiveness that&#39;s a really good sell</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.540" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">for lazy people yeah well I never got</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.390" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s Islam for you they&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:48.330" style="s2">that together so so rested ISM stood for</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:51.060" style="s2">something different he was the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.330" end="00:09:53.070" style="s2">so Astron ism celebrated the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.060" end="00:09:55.410" style="s2">knowledge it celebrated human</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.070" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">independence from the gods it celebrated</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.410" end="00:10:00.300" style="s2">being adult being independent from your</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:02.490" style="s2">parents moving on creating a new world</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.300" end="00:10:06.960" style="s2">different from your parents world okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.490" end="00:10:09.240" style="s2">so the East is fundamentally what I call</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.960" end="00:10:11.700" style="s2">the Silk Route tried the Silk Route is</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.240" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">still unwritten history and why because</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.700" end="00:10:16.200" style="s2">the circle connected China with Persia</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.900" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">of the internet that&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.400" end="00:14:20.300" style="s2">it&#39;s just conquer the globe and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:22.730" style="s2">essentially the world today is one thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.300" end="00:14:24.890" style="s2">called Internet - it&#39;s seven billion</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.730" end="00:14:27.950" style="s2">very confused dividual bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.890" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">connected mm-hmm these bodies are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.950" end="00:14:32.210" style="s2">be around a generation from now they</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:35.060" style="s2">better have some kind of contributed</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.210" end="00:14:36.770" style="s2">role for the overall system meaning what</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.060" end="00:14:39.050" style="s2">does it mean to be human in digital</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.770" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">well it means supplying something</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.050" end="00:14:44.420" style="s2">machines cannot do they cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.010" end="00:14:46.700" style="s2">biologically and emotionally intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.420" end="00:14:49.970" style="s2">so this is kind of the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.700" end="00:14:55.520" style="s2">the kurtzweil vision the singularity has</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.970" end="00:14:56.060" style="s2">already happened seven billion people</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.740" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">meaning the mediums conquered everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.320" end="00:15:20.750" style="s2">it&#39;s conquered our entire imaginary</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:26.120" style="s2">us has been conquered by digital already</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.200" end="00:15:29.300" style="s2">we call it the global Empire we wrote</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.120" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">the book sixteen years ago we said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.300" end="00:15:34.790" style="s2">already happened it&#39;s a fact now I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.620" style="s2">to live with that fact the Internet is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.790" end="00:15:39.200" style="s2">not confused he just operates it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.620" end="00:15:41.090" style="s2">operates in a way that while neutron</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.200" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">bombs can kill humanity we cannot kill</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.090" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">the internet with the neutron bombs can</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:49.850" style="s2">okay we can&#39;t we couldn&#39;t have some sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.460" end="00:15:51.380" style="s2">of explosion that would know you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.850" end="00:15:56.060" style="s2">blow an entire planet the internet will</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.380" end="00:15:57.830" style="s2">still be around how does that how would</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.060" end="00:16:00.140" style="s2">that would that would that work he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.830" end="00:16:03.200" style="s2">build by military engineers to survive</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.140" end="00:16:04.760" style="s2">any years and they were successful and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.200" end="00:16:08.450" style="s2">they created the monster okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.760" end="00:16:11.300" style="s2">now the monsters out of the bottle it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.450" end="00:16:14.020" style="s2">a monster yep again what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.300" end="00:16:17.180" style="s2">from me mister what do you want from me</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.020" end="00:16:19.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the honest question today and my</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.180" end="00:16:22.640" style="s2">answer to that is synthetic intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.810" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">synthetic intelligence yeah my friends</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.640" end="00:16:27.260" style="s2">in America for example you know Jordy</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:28.940" style="s2">Hall that&#39;s working collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.260" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">intelligence okay that&#39;s another term I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.940" end="00:16:33.440" style="s2">call it synthetic in charge because what</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:34.970" style="s2">it is it is that we&#39;re looking at life</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.440" end="00:16:36.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re looking at consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.970" end="00:16:37.880" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at sub consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.320" end="00:16:39.830" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at how the human body</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.880" end="00:16:42.260" style="s2">operates and how the human mind operates</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.830" end="00:16:44.240" style="s2">how the senses operate we have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.260" end="00:16:45.950" style="s2">relearn we have to we study Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.240" end="00:16:49.180" style="s2">have to go back to basics again to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.950" end="00:16:49.180" style="s2">understand what it means to be human</p>
