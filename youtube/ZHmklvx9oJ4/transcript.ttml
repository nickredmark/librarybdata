<p begin="00:00:09.080" end="00:00:14.540" style="s2">So momentarily we’re going to return to<br />the basic story.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.540" end="00:00:20.550" style="s2">I want to talk to you today about how your<br />brain organizes your perceptions, and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.550" end="00:00:22.760" style="s2">I want to talk to you about how that’s represented<br />in mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.760" end="00:00:31.720" style="s2">The first thing I’d like to point out, is<br />we talked about the difference between Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.720" end="00:00:40.879" style="s2">and Newtonian viewpoints a while back.</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.879" end="00:00:45.299" style="s2">One claim that you might make if you were<br />Darwinian is that whatever your brain is adapted</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.299" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">to is reality.</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:57.720" style="s2">That seems to be the central claim of Darwinian<br />evolution, is that you can’t define reality</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.720" end="00:01:03.379" style="s2">any more accurately than that which selects.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.379" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">I want to tell you about how I think the brain<br />is organized.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:16.650" style="s2">Then I want to show you, I hope, that the<br />way fundamental narratives work can be mapped</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.650" end="00:01:19.340" style="s2">on to that brain structure.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.340" end="00:01:26.620" style="s2">To me that implies that there’s something<br />right about fundamental narratives, because</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.620" end="00:01:33.160" style="s2">otherwise why would they map onto the brain<br />structures that have evolved to adapt us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.160" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">the environment?</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:43.490" style="s2">People think about reality in objective terms,<br />and they think about it as decomposable into</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.490" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">tiny subunits.</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">I think that’s a limited viewpoint, a powerful<br />but limited viewpoint.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:02:00.229" style="s2">I think it’s much more realistic to assume<br />that whatever reality is, is more like a continual</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.229" end="00:02:04.190" style="s2">interplay of very, very complex patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.190" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">I suppose you could make the case that those<br />patterns are ultimately made out of particles,</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:16.840" style="s2">but even that’s not exactly true because<br />the particles have to be arrayed in space.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.840" end="00:02:22.390" style="s2">That’s part of the atomic theory is that<br />there’s not just subatomic particles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.390" end="00:02:26.030" style="s2">atomic particles, but that they’re arrayed<br />in space.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.030" end="00:02:30.100" style="s2">If they’re arrayed in space, that means<br />the manner in which they’re arrayed can</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.100" end="00:02:31.100" style="s2">be informative.</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.100" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">And if you reduce the phenoma to the particle,<br />without taking into account the patterning</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">of array of the particles, then there are<br />levels and levels and levels of information</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:46.130" style="s2">that you lose.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.130" end="00:02:52.840" style="s2">Those levels of information are – they may<br />not be relevant for our physical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:57.490" style="s2">of the make-up of atomic and subatomic particles,<br />but they’re definitely relevant to whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.490" end="00:03:00.350" style="s2">we can walk across the street safely.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.350" end="00:03:08.020" style="s2">I would say if you’re related to reality<br />properly, the kind of information that you’re</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.020" end="00:03:12.580" style="s2">processing is precisely the kind of information<br />that allows you to cross the street properly;</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.580" end="00:03:16.910" style="s2">and to do all the other things during your<br />days, your weeks, your months that you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.910" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">to in order to stay alive and fundamentally,<br />in some sense, propagate.</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:26.190" style="s2">Alright, so we’ll start with the neuropsychological<br />argument.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.190" end="00:03:32.930" style="s2">Now we’ve already established the idea that<br />these little frames of reference, or maps,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.930" end="00:03:40.410" style="s2">or stories, or whatever you call them – I’ll<br />call them stories from hereon in, are little</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.410" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">gold-directed units.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:47.569" style="s2">They’re units of conception and emotion<br />and perception and behavior; they’re little</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.569" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.170" end="00:03:56.050" style="s2">The sub-personality has an initial starting<br />point and a destination point, and then it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.050" end="00:04:01.239" style="s2">implements behaviors to transform the starting<br />point into the destination point.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.239" end="00:04:05.150" style="s2">Then you might say, well what forms these<br />little sub-personalities?</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.150" end="00:04:11.430" style="s2">The answer to that is very complex, but one<br />answer is: fundamental motivations.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.430" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">I arranged the fundamental motivations on<br />this particular diagram pointing out that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">you can roughly consider motivations, as those<br />that maintain you, and those that propagate</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:27.620" style="s2">you.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.620" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">Now it’s just a heuristic, it’s just a<br />way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:36.740" style="s2">Under self-maintenance there’s thermal regulation,<br />thirst, hunger and elimination, and there’s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:39.889" style="s2">all sorts of other things as well, but those<br />will do for the time being.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.889" end="00:04:43.750" style="s2">Under self-propagation there’s affiliative<br />desire and sexual desire.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.750" end="00:04:52.669" style="s2">The things that’s quite interesting about<br />all of this is that there are brain structures</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.669" end="00:04:57.949" style="s2">that underlie the manifestation of these fundamental<br />sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.949" end="00:05:03.620" style="s2">Now people tend to think about them either<br />as motivations or emotions, and I think that’s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.620" end="00:05:05.409" style="s2">another useful heuristic.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.409" end="00:05:10.099" style="s2">You can say that, roughly speaking, that a<br />motivation pops up an entire frame of reference</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.099" end="00:05:14.099" style="s2">and emotion tends to orient you within that<br />frame of reference.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.099" end="00:05:20.710" style="s2">But that’s only a conceptual simplification,<br />because what you see when look at the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:27.699" style="s2">brain structures is that there isn’t an<br />emotion center – there are a bunch of micro-units</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.699" end="00:05:35.570" style="s2">in the brain, and there are separable micro-units<br />for different emotions and different motivations</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.570" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">and they don’t necessarily have that much<br />in common in terms of their locale, except</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:43.659" style="s2">that they tend to be relatively deep in the<br />brain.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.659" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">Some are hypothalamic and some are in the<br />amygdala, and some are in the periaqueductal</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.800" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">grey, which seems to be responsible for pain<br />responses.</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:55.530" style="s2">So we can classify things as motivations and<br />emotions, but it doesn’t map one-to-one</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.530" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">on the underlying brain structure.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:03.629" style="s2">Now I think what we’ll do with regards to<br />talking about the brain is we’ll start from</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.629" end="00:06:04.659" style="s2">the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.659" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">It’s appropriate to start from the bottom<br />up because you are more dependent on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:15.749" style="s2">ancient brain structures than you are on your<br />modern brain structures; in that, if you damage</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.749" end="00:06:20.050" style="s2">your modern brain structures, and I mean relatively<br />modern, let’s say the ones that have really</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.050" end="00:06:25.569" style="s2">evolved in great detail over the last two<br />million years, the cortical cap, in particular,</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.569" end="00:06:28.699" style="s2">the prefrontal cortex, a lot of the visual<br />cortex.</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.699" end="00:06:31.240" style="s2">If you damage that you can pretty much go<br />on.</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.240" end="00:06:34.899" style="s2">Now you’re going to have one impairment<br />or another impairment, but you can still stay</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.899" end="00:06:35.899" style="s2">alive.</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.899" end="00:06:40.099" style="s2">However, there are structures that are lower<br />down that if you damage, that’s the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.099" end="00:06:41.099" style="s2">of you.</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.099" end="00:06:45.219" style="s2">So for example, the ascending reticular activating<br />system, which is the thing that wakes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.219" end="00:06:49.939" style="s2">up when you’re asleep at night, when a noise<br />occurs that shouldn’t occur.</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.939" end="00:06:53.529" style="s2">It seems to be the activating center for consciousness,<br />whatever that means.</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.529" end="00:06:58.219" style="s2">It’s way deep down in the brain, it’s<br />way deep down at the top of the spinal cord,</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.219" end="00:06:59.639" style="s2">roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.639" end="00:07:03.899" style="s2">If you twist your head in a car accident a<br />little bit too roughly, and you sheer off</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.899" end="00:07:08.379" style="s2">the ascending fibers, and you’re in a coma<br />permanently, then nothing can wake you up.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.379" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">That’s pretty interesting – to know that<br />consciousness, our tendency is to think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:18.400" style="s2">that as a function of the higher cortical<br />systems, is dependent completely on something</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.400" end="00:07:21.279" style="s2">that is unbelievably ancient.</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.279" end="00:07:27.469" style="s2">So it begs the question, exactly what level<br />of neuronal complexity do you have to be before</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.469" end="00:07:28.939" style="s2">you have sub consciousness?</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.939" end="00:07:32.069" style="s2">The answer to that is, we don’t know.</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.069" end="00:07:36.580" style="s2">The relationship between consciousness and<br />neuronal structure is insanely complex.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.580" end="00:07:45.419" style="s2">For example, you have very neuron-heavy structures<br />in your brain, like the cerebellum, which</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.419" end="00:07:51.279" style="s2">has a very rough outer-coating like the cortex,<br />and it has about as many neurons as the cortical</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.279" end="00:07:52.430" style="s2">sheet does.</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.430" end="00:07:56.610" style="s2">Yet, you can take it out of people and they<br />don’t seem to show any impairment in consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:08:00.419" style="s2">but they get ataxic and they can’t control<br />their behavior that well.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.419" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">They have a hard time guiding it – but that<br />seems to be more or less it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">Now it isn’t, because there are other things<br />that the cerebellum does, but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:15.319" style="s2">that you can have massively neuron-heavy structures<br />that seem to be related in very minimal ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.319" end="00:08:17.889" style="s2">to our experience of consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.889" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">Your autonomic nervous system is sort of like<br />that – there are a lot of neurons in your</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.970" style="s2">autonomic nervous system, but I think it’s<br />a mistake to say that we’re precisely conscious</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.970" end="00:08:30.449" style="s2">of our autonomic nervous system; although<br />now and then we’re conscious of its outputs.</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.449" end="00:08:35.669" style="s2">It governs the operation of our organs and<br />all the things that are so complex that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.669" end="00:08:38.960" style="s2">aren’t allowed to mess with them as conscious<br />beings.</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.960" end="00:08:43.690" style="s2">But it’s not conscious, and then somehow<br />some neurons are conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.690" end="00:08:46.960" style="s2">I tell you, we don’t know anything about<br />consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.960" end="00:08:48.990" style="s2">We really don’t, we don’t have a clue.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.990" end="00:08:54.220" style="s2">I think it’s probably because we’re formulating<br />the question wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.220" end="00:08:59.460" style="s2">There are people who are materialist reductionists,<br />and they believe that consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.460" end="00:09:03.470" style="s2">emergent property of the underlying neuronal<br />function.</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.470" end="00:09:08.310" style="s2">The problem with that philosophy is that it’s<br />predicated on the assumption that they understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.310" end="00:09:12.070" style="s2">what the matter is that’s making up that<br />neuronal substrate.</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.070" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">I can tell you that by the time we’re able<br />to reduce consciousness to its underlying</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:20.750" style="s2">material structure, we’ll think of whatever<br />matter is, in a way that’s completely different</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.750" end="00:09:22.140" style="s2">than the way we think of it now.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.140" end="00:09:26.680" style="s2">So there might be an eventual reduction, but<br />at the same time there’s going to be a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.680" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">of the theories.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:34.001" style="s2">It’s clear that we don’t understand material<br />that well, particularly because when you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.001" end="00:09:40.110" style="s2">down to the tiny underlying substructures<br />at the subatomic level it behaves in a very,</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.110" end="00:09:43.090" style="s2">very peculiar manner.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.090" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">So anyways, all bets are off in regards to<br />consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:52.890" style="s2">It also does seem to be something that’s<br />likely very ancient.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.890" end="00:09:55.830" style="s2">There are people who have attributed consciousness<br />to insects.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.830" end="00:10:00.360" style="s2">Insects, by the way, seem to go out of their<br />way to take hallucinogenic drugs, which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.360" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">quite interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.380" end="00:10:07.570" style="s2">So the fly agaric, for example, is the famous<br />red and white mushroom that you always see</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.570" end="00:10:10.710" style="s2">in fairy tales and in super Mario brothers.</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.710" end="00:10:12.540" style="s2">It pops up everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:17.140" style="s2">Flies will come and take a bite of it and<br />they fall unconscious beside the mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.140" end="00:10:22.470" style="s2">and they stay there for ten or fifteen minutes,<br />and then they get up, but they go eat it again.</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.470" end="00:10:27.530" style="s2">Reindeer really like them too and they get<br />blitzed out of their mind on amanita muscaria.</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.530" end="00:10:34.220" style="s2">There’s evidence for the desire to transform<br />states of consciousness, way, way down in</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.220" end="00:10:36.720" style="s2">the animal kingdom, way farther than you’d<br />think.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.720" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">So God only knows.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">Then you think well a big brain is necessary,<br />but if you consider something like Irene Pepperberg’s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:51.410" style="s2">African Grey parrot, which died a couple of<br />years ago – a famous animal which could</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.410" end="00:10:54.220" style="s2">speak better than a three year old kid.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:59.100" style="s2">It had a good vocabulary, more than five hundred<br />words, and it could put together meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.100" end="00:11:00.100" style="s2">phrases.</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.100" end="00:11:02.510" style="s2">It could speak better than a chimpanzee.</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.510" end="00:11:04.700" style="s2">They use sign language of course.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.700" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">This was one smart bird.</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.900" style="s2">If you think about a bird, it has no brain,<br />a bird.</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.900" end="00:11:11.500" style="s2">It’s got a brain about this big.</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:15.650" style="s2">I know a bird isn’t very big, and that actually<br />makes a difference.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.650" end="00:11:20.620" style="s2">The fact that that much intelligence could<br />be compacted in that small of an area, means</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.620" end="00:11:24.170" style="s2">as far as I’m concerned, that we don’t<br />really understand very much about how the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.170" end="00:11:26.760" style="s2">brain works.</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.760" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">We do understand some things, and most of<br />the things we understand have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:33.870" style="s2">discovered by animal experimentalists.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.870" end="00:11:35.470" style="s2">Which is a useful thing to know.</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.470" end="00:11:38.910" style="s2">Because of course there are a lot of people<br />who think that animal experimentation isn’t</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.910" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">a good idea, or that we could substitute computer<br />models – which is a spectacularly idiotic</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:45.720" style="s2">theory.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.720" end="00:11:49.670" style="s2">Obviously if we had accurate computer models<br />we wouldn’t need to do the animal experimentation.</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">We’re not going to build a computer model<br />that’s better than our current understanding,</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">at least not yet; we may in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:09.790" style="s2">Anyways you can think of the basic structures<br />that are producing these little sub-personalities</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.790" end="00:12:12.210" style="s2">as the output of fundamental biological systems.</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.210" end="00:12:13.910" style="s2">They’re either motivations or emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.910" end="00:12:19.480" style="s2">The structure that appears to be most responsible<br />for this sort of thing, at least initially,</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.480" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">is the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:23.260" style="s2">I should show you a little bit about the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.260" end="00:12:28.010" style="s2">Just so you kind of have a sense of what it<br />is.</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.010" end="00:12:34.180" style="s2">It’s not very big, and you’ll see in this<br />diagram that it sits right on top of the spinal</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.180" end="00:12:36.170" style="s2">cord and the base part of the brain.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.170" end="00:12:38.690" style="s2">That’s just that little bitty area there.</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.690" end="00:12:44.650" style="s2">It looks from the diagram it seems to be about<br />one percent of the entire brain mass or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.650" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:49.060" style="s2">I think I mentioned to you before that if<br />you take a cat and you take all of its brain</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.060" end="00:12:53.490" style="s2">off, except for the hypothalamus, roughly<br />speaking, as long as it’s a female cat in</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.490" end="00:12:59.710" style="s2">a restrictive environment, it can pretty much<br />live a cat life; except that it’s hyper-exploratory.</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.710" end="00:13:03.300" style="s2">Which I do think is quite remarkable, because<br />you’d think that it would just lay there</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.300" end="00:13:08.100" style="s2">passively, since it doesn’t have a brain.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.100" end="00:13:13.660" style="s2">The hypothalamus, I’ll show you some more<br />pictures here of the hypothalamus, this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.660" end="00:13:18.820" style="s2">a rat hypothalamus, and this is a diagram<br />from Larry Swanson, who’s a real genius,</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.820" end="00:13:21.960" style="s2">and well-worth reading, although very complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.960" end="00:13:27.450" style="s2">He’s a developmental neuro-anatomist, if<br />I remember correctly, and he’s interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.450" end="00:13:31.940" style="s2">in how the brain unfolds across the course<br />of fetal development in all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.940" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">animals.</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:37.650" style="s2">Assuming by doing that in part, you can track<br />the evolution, but you can also understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.650" end="00:13:40.430" style="s2">the relationship between one brain part and<br />another.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.430" end="00:13:48.310" style="s2">What you see here, you see all of these little<br />sub-units of the hypothalamus, they’re indicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.310" end="00:13:54.940" style="s2">in orange, green and black, and so the first<br />thing that you can see is the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.940" end="00:14:02.050" style="s2">is not one thing, it’s a bunch of ganglia,<br />I think is the correct name for the hypothalamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.050" end="00:14:03.050" style="s2">sub-organs.</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.050" end="00:14:10.310" style="s2">So, it’s called a hypothalamus sort of for<br />convenience sake, you can identify it anatomically</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.310" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">and it might be a good short-hand for a rough<br />description of the macrostructure of the brain,</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:22.050" style="s2">but of course the problem with the brain is,<br />you know, it’s pattern one at this level</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.050" end="00:14:25.370" style="s2">and it’s pattern two at this level, and<br />it’s pattern three at this level.</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.370" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">You can go a long ways down before you run<br />out of complexity.</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">A cell is an unbelievably complicated thing,<br />and you have, God only knows how many of those</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">things you have in your brain.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:40.100" style="s2">I don’t remember exactly what the latest<br />estimates are, but it’s in the hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.100" end="00:14:41.100" style="s2">of billions.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.100" end="00:14:47.860" style="s2">Each of those cells is as complex as really<br />complex factory, and it’s full of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.860" end="00:14:52.390" style="s2">little molecular machines and they’re doing<br />things that are so complicated and amazing,</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.390" end="00:14:57.240" style="s2">you just can’t believe it when you – I’ve<br />seen computer animations of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.240" end="00:15:04.430" style="s2">structures in operation, and the complexity<br />of what they do to take the DNA molecule apart,</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.430" end="00:15:09.590" style="s2">and then to rebuild it little bit by little<br />bit, and to do error correction at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.590" end="00:15:13.970" style="s2">time, it just boggles the mind.</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.970" end="00:15:19.520" style="s2">I cannot see how you can possibly account<br />for that using a straight, sort of Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.520" end="00:15:25.560" style="s2">deterministic model of clock ward behavior;<br />the stuff is so sophisticated.</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.560" end="00:15:32.150" style="s2">It looks more like advanced robotics than<br />it does the interaction of tiny little molecules.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.150" end="00:15:36.990" style="s2">There are molecules that work with the DNA<br />that can walk, and as they walk they carry</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.990" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">other molecules, and not only can they walk,<br />they can walk over obstacles.</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">They’re like made out of ten molecules!</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:47.500" style="s2">What’s going on?</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.500" end="00:15:49.560" style="s2">It’s just beyond belief.</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.560" end="00:15:57.270" style="s2">Okay, so all of these little nuclei in the<br />hypothalamus, they’re all doing slightly</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.270" end="00:16:02.730" style="s2">different things, they’re radically different<br />things, although they have commonality in</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.730" end="00:16:03.730" style="s2">function.</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.730" end="00:16:08.410" style="s2">So, roughly what you could say is that one<br />half of the hypothalamus is devoted to popping</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.410" end="00:16:19.529" style="s2">up little sub-personalities that are devoted<br />to the satisfaction of fundamental biological</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.529" end="00:16:21.089" style="s2">requirements.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.089" end="00:16:28.650" style="s2">It’s not obvious what a fundamental biological<br />requirement is, because that’s a heuristic,</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.650" end="00:16:35.800" style="s2">it’s not a category, it’s a fuzzy category,<br />but we can agree on some of its contents.</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.800" end="00:16:39.930" style="s2">So of course thirst, hunger and the need to<br />breathe would be in there, and might also</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.930" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">add pain, and sexual desire and the need for<br />play, although that’s a separate circuit</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:51.700" style="s2">and it’s not mediated by hypothalamic structures,<br />there’s a different circuit for play.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.700" end="00:16:56.150" style="s2">Play slash affiliation.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.150" end="00:17:04.860" style="s2">Roughly speaking what an animal basically<br />chases and requires on a day-today and week-to-week</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.860" end="00:17:07.980" style="s2">basis is mediated in large part by the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.980" end="00:17:14.740" style="s2">And the hypothalamus is also a crucial nexus<br />in the brain for identifying what’s going</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.740" end="00:17:18.309" style="s2">on in the body and then telling the brain<br />what to do about it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.309" end="00:17:21.889" style="s2">So for example the hypothalamus is the thing<br />that makes you hungry and the thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.889" end="00:17:22.889" style="s2">you thirsty.</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.889" end="00:17:29.350" style="s2">It does that because it monitors levels of<br />substances such as sugar in your bloodstream,</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.350" end="00:17:35.309" style="s2">and also the degree to which you’re hydrated.</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.309" end="00:17:40.950" style="s2">You can sustain tiny little bits of damage<br />to the hypothalamus, which has unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.950" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">extreme consequences.</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">So for example, if you get unlucky, you can<br />develop hyper aphasia or, uncontrollable thirst.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">If that part of your hypothalamus is damaged,<br />people just can’t keep you away from water</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:01.289" style="s2">supplies, you’ll just drink and drink and<br />drink and drink until you drown.</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.289" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">You can’t control it.</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:06.769" style="s2">So the hypothalamus is no joke and hyperphagia<br />is the same thing, except in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.769" end="00:18:08.419" style="s2">to food.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.419" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">There have been reports of people who developed-<br />I knew a guy in Montreal, who used to work</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:17.080" style="s2">at Harvard.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.080" end="00:18:18.580" style="s2">His name was Frank Irvin.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.580" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">He did some of the earliest studies in the<br />world on the physiology of violent crime.</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">Frank had identified the role of epilepsy<br />as a progenator to violent crimes.</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:37.630" style="s2">The defense rage circuit is part of the hypothalamus<br />and if you’re unlucky you can have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.630" end="00:18:41.809" style="s2">form of epilepsy that will activate the defense<br />rage system.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.809" end="00:18:46.669" style="s2">I knew someone who had a seizure condition<br />like that.</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.669" end="00:18:49.990" style="s2">Then they get uncontrollably aggressive.</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.990" end="00:18:53.590" style="s2">Now this guy has quite an interesting story.</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.590" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">So it first happened to him when he was about<br />eighteen.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:18:58.940" style="s2">He was out drinking in a bar.</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.940" end="00:19:02.210" style="s2">Now, alcohol lowers your seizure threshold.</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.210" end="00:19:09.980" style="s2">So he’s out drinking in a bar and all of<br />a sudden he got up and tore his shirt off.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.980" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">He was in an aggressive stance and backed<br />into the corner, and his friends were coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:14.470" style="s2">towards him.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.470" end="00:19:17.899" style="s2">He told them to go away or I’ll hit you.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.899" end="00:19:23.019" style="s2">Now he was a very well socialized person,<br />so I think what happened is he went into this</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.019" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">defensive rage state, but because he was so<br />well socialized, he could tell people to stay</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.340" end="00:19:32.149" style="s2">away from him, but he couldn’t stop himself<br />from hitting them and attacking them if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.149" end="00:19:33.799" style="s2">got close enough.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.799" end="00:19:38.899" style="s2">So anyways, I believe at that point he slapped<br />a police officer who came to rescue him.</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.899" end="00:19:44.220" style="s2">They took him to the hospital and on the way<br />there he hit his fingers against the hood</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.220" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">of the car and put dents in it, and then when<br />he got to the hospital – now I don’t remember</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:53.869" style="s2">the particulars of this – but he picked<br />up a kidney bowl, which is like an enamel</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.869" end="00:19:57.710" style="s2">covered steel bowl, and twisted it in a figure<br />eight.</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.710" end="00:20:00.899" style="s2">It’s like, try that, it’s not so easy.</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.899" end="00:20:07.539" style="s2">The next time it happened he was in another<br />bar, so what the hypothesis was then, was</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.539" end="00:20:13.799" style="s2">that someone had spiked his alcohol with some<br />sort of drug, but that was never demonstrated.</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.799" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">He got off of all that because he had no record,<br />he was a perfectly peaceful person.</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">Then the next time it happened he was in another<br />bar, and he did the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:25.659" style="s2">He backed into the corner and he ripped off<br />his shirt, and he told me that when he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.659" end="00:20:29.629" style="s2">looking, he looked down the hallway and all<br />he could see was fire.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.629" end="00:20:36.013" style="s2">A policewoman came to get him, because the<br />bar called the police, and he hit her.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.013" end="00:20:41.169" style="s2">Then after that he had EEG testing, which<br />showed that he was susceptible to seizures</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.169" end="00:20:42.440" style="s2">so he swore off alcohol.</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.440" end="00:20:44.809" style="s2">He never had another drink and he’s like<br />thirty-five now.</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.809" end="00:20:47.570" style="s2">He never had another drink in his life and<br />it never happened again.</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.570" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">It’s just a good example of – there was<br />a kid at the University of Texas, at Austin,</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:58.140" style="s2">about thirty years ago, who seemed to have<br />a perfectly reasonable family life and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.140" end="00:21:02.450" style="s2">far, a reasonable upbringing, and he started<br />to become increasingly violent in his fantasies.</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.450" end="00:21:07.429" style="s2">He climbed up onto the tower, because there’s<br />a high tower at the University of Texas at</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.429" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">Austin, and he took at high-powered rifle<br />and I think he shot sixteen people before</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:13.029" style="s2">they finally got him.</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.029" end="00:21:16.410" style="s2">When they did an autopsy, they found he had<br />a high-pressing tumor that was growing on</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.410" end="00:21:18.020" style="s2">the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.020" end="00:21:20.629" style="s2">The hypothalamus is no joke.</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.629" end="00:21:25.759" style="s2">For those of you who’s introduction to neuropsychology<br />has made you assume that the cortex is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.759" end="00:21:33.279" style="s2">control, let me tell you, the cortex is only<br />in control when all of your other basic requirements</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.279" end="00:21:35.110" style="s2">are satiated.</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.110" end="00:21:39.990" style="s2">Since you’re a modern person, and you live<br />in luxury, that’s unparalleled in the history</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.990" end="00:21:47.450" style="s2">of the world, all of your fundamental biological<br />sub-personalities are always satiated.</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.450" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2">That’s what you think you’re like.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.500" end="00:21:55.749" style="s2">You’re only like that because you’ve never<br />been anywhere where you weren’t like that.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.749" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">So anyways, here’s one of the things that’s<br />cool about the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:05.879" style="s2">The first thing is that you have these different<br />sub-systems, these different nuclei that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.879" end="00:22:08.539" style="s2">responsible for these different sub-personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.539" end="00:22:13.389" style="s2">Oriented towards sexuality, oriented towards<br />hunger, oriented towards thirst, oriented</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.389" end="00:22:16.659" style="s2">towards temperature regulation, etc.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.659" end="00:22:21.580" style="s2">I think of them as sub-personalities because<br />they have a viewpoint, they want something</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.580" end="00:22:25.730" style="s2">and they want to go somewhere, they want to<br />accomplish it efficiently, and they have emotions</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.730" end="00:22:30.369" style="s2">that go along with it so, you know, if you’re<br />going for some water and you drop your glass,</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.369" end="00:22:33.950" style="s2">or somebody gets in your way, or the tap isn’t<br />working, you’re going to feel frustration,</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.950" end="00:22:35.500" style="s2">anxiety and irritation.</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.500" end="00:22:42.059" style="s2">They come fulyl equipped with emotions, they<br />have their own motor outputs, so they basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.059" end="00:22:48.779" style="s2">prime, and those would be the motor outputs<br />that are aggregations of habits that you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.779" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">been able to learn that have aided you previously<br />in your water-searching behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:22:58.730" style="s2">So for us, that would be getting a glass out<br />of the cupboard, which is a gripping issue,</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.730" end="00:23:02.519" style="s2">and a transport issue, and then you have to<br />turn on the tap.</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.519" end="00:23:08.919" style="s2">Luria, who’s a famous Russian psychologist<br />called those things Kinetic Melodies.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.919" end="00:23:13.630" style="s2">If you think about it from a Piagetian perspective<br />and a Lurian perspective at the same time,</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.630" end="00:23:20.490" style="s2">you think how Piaget talked about how children<br />put together basic – they’re not reflexes</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.490" end="00:23:24.419" style="s2">exactly, they’re complex sequences of what<br />started as reflexes.</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.419" end="00:23:30.429" style="s2">Then those can be linked together in a sort<br />of dance that you’re always doing with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.429" end="00:23:31.429" style="s2">body.</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.429" end="00:23:36.950" style="s2">Each of those little dances, you think water-seeking,<br />you’re going to have a set of water relevant</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.950" end="00:23:41.759" style="s2">dances that you can do that your experiences<br />taught you to become an expert at.</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.759" end="00:23:44.390" style="s2">When you get thirsty those are likely disinhibited.</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.390" end="00:23:50.299" style="s2">That’s my guess, they’re disinhibited<br />and prepared for execution.</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.299" end="00:23:55.320" style="s2">Then the specifics of the circumstance that<br />you’re in will determine which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.320" end="00:23:56.529" style="s2">disinhibited enough to actually run.</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.529" end="00:23:59.659" style="s2">It’s like you’re full of little machines<br />and they’re all on.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.659" end="00:24:06.570" style="s2">They’re ready to go, but they’re all held<br />in stasis in some sense by some cortical inhibition.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.570" end="00:24:09.309" style="s2">I like to think of the brain sort of like<br />a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.309" end="00:24:13.859" style="s2">The core is really active, it’s on, but<br />then you have all of these rods going into</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.859" end="00:24:17.970" style="s2">the core to keep it from going critical.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.970" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">The cortex is sort of like that in relationship<br />to the lower parts of the brain.</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:24.590" style="s2">Those parts of the brain, man, they’re alive.</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.590" end="00:24:26.970" style="s2">They’re like the Titans of mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.970" end="00:24:31.529" style="s2">They’re sitting down there, these fundamental<br />forces and they’re ready to leap into action</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.529" end="00:24:33.029" style="s2">at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.029" end="00:24:39.500" style="s2">But the cortex basically keeps them inhibited,<br />and it seems to do that – so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.500" end="00:24:42.909" style="s2">you have a vision of your desired future.</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.909" end="00:24:49.330" style="s2">Then a vision of the transformation stages<br />that you’re going to undertake to move from</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.330" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">where you are to that desired future.</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:57.799" style="s2">Then what you’re doing is you’re comparing<br />your interpretation of the present to your</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.799" end="00:25:00.870" style="s2">interpretation of the desired future.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.870" end="00:25:07.190" style="s2">As long as those two things match, which the<br />hippocampus is the thing that’s determining</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.190" end="00:25:11.899" style="s2">that, it’s the thing that’s computing<br />the match between your fantasy of what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.899" end="00:25:15.419" style="s2">want to happen with your fantasy about what<br />is happening.</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.419" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">As long as that matches then the hippocampus<br />basically, now we don’t know exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:25.620" style="s2">this works, although it seems to work to some<br />degree through modulation of the reticular</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.620" end="00:25:32.409" style="s2">activating system – if the hippocampus matches<br />what you want with what’s happening, then</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.409" end="00:25:35.630" style="s2">all these other little sub-systems basically<br />turn off.</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.630" end="00:25:41.049" style="s2">If the hippocampus detects a mismatch, which<br />is when novelty occurs – something went</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.049" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">wrong, then you get disinhibition of the reticular<br />activating system.</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:49.139" style="s2">It’s like you wake up, and then everything<br />is primed for action.</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.139" end="00:25:52.940" style="s2">That solves the problem of what you should<br />do when you don’t know what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.940" end="00:25:56.519" style="s2">The answer is, you should get ready to do<br />everything.</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.519" end="00:26:03.139" style="s2">You should be on alert and ready to implement<br />whatever actions – it’s not even whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.139" end="00:26:10.039" style="s2">actions, it’s more like you should be ready<br />to implement whatever sub-personalities the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.039" end="00:26:14.850" style="s2">situation seems to call for, as soon as you’re<br />able to identify what they are.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.850" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">Otherwise it’s sort of like an army that’s<br />on alert.</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:20.489" style="s2">You don’t know who’s going to be called<br />on, but everybody should be ready.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.489" end="00:26:24.029" style="s2">That’s a high stress situation.</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.029" end="00:26:29.110" style="s2">Okay, so part of the hypothalamus, let’s<br />say for the sake of argument, it’s popping</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.110" end="00:26:33.210" style="s2">up all of these little sub-personalities that<br />have to do with basic instincts.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.210" end="00:26:40.330" style="s2">The words are all wrong because they’re<br />not – an instinct sounds like a drive and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.330" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">people aren’t driven.</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.249" style="s2">We’re not that simple, we’re much more<br />flexible than that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.249" end="00:26:46.649" style="s2">Even rats aren’t driven.</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.649" end="00:26:52.840" style="s2">There’s a very seminal experiment that was<br />done at the height of behaviorism.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.840" end="00:26:58.119" style="s2">So the idea with behaviorists, perfectly smart<br />idea, was that the way a rat learned was,</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.119" end="00:27:03.379" style="s2">it would start with a reflex, sort of in the<br />Piagetian sense, and then you could teach</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.379" end="00:27:08.259" style="s2">it a new routine which was an aggregation<br />of little, tiny reflexes, you could teach</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.259" end="00:27:10.359" style="s2">it a new routine by rewarding it.</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.359" end="00:27:14.230" style="s2">So let’s say, here’s what you do with<br />a rat: so you want to teach the rat to climb</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.230" end="00:27:16.749" style="s2">the ladder and go across it.</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.749" end="00:27:23.409" style="s2">So the rat’s sniffing around in the little<br />rat cage.</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.409" end="00:27:27.010" style="s2">Then it gets close to the ladder, so you give<br />it a food pellet.</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.010" end="00:27:29.549" style="s2">Then it hangs around close to the ladder.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.549" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">It’s because you’ve reinforced the manifestation<br />of those micro-behaviors that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:37.080" style="s2">with the ladder.</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.080" end="00:27:41.429" style="s2">Then maybe at some point the rat puts a little<br />paw up on the first rung, so you give it a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.429" end="00:27:42.429" style="s2">food pellet.</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.429" end="00:27:44.250" style="s2">Then the rat is going like this very frequently.</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.250" end="00:27:48.450" style="s2">Then the next thing that happens is it puts<br />two paws up there, and you know if you’re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.450" end="00:27:53.990" style="s2">patient, using reward you can get that damn<br />rat to do damn near anything.</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.990" end="00:28:00.059" style="s2">Skinner taught pigeons to navigate guided<br />missiles by maps in the Second World War,</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.059" end="00:28:01.059" style="s2">by pecking.</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.059" end="00:28:03.799" style="s2">They never did use them, but really that’s<br />pretty impressive.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.799" end="00:28:07.869" style="s2">You think pigeons are stupid, they’re not<br />stupid they can read maps, which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.869" end="00:28:10.419" style="s2">damn amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.419" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">So the idea was is what the animal is doing<br />is chaining together deterministic reflexes.</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:21.220" style="s2">The thing about a deterministic reflex is<br />that it’s not flexible right?</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.220" end="00:28:24.879" style="s2">If it’s a deterministic reflex, it really<br />is a drive.</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.879" end="00:28:30.470" style="s2">Action A initiates Action B, which initiates<br />Action C and it’s a fixed action pattern.</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.470" end="00:28:32.639" style="s2">Some animals do seem to learn that way.</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.639" end="00:28:34.049" style="s2">There are these little animals.</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.049" end="00:28:37.820" style="s2">I think they’re moles that do this, it’s<br />shrews.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.820" end="00:28:48.190" style="s2">Let’s say you teach a shrew to go from point<br />A to B by a very inefficient maze-like route.</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.190" end="00:28:54.220" style="s2">But the shrew could just walk straight there,<br />but once he learns to do this, but he can’t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.220" end="00:28:56.309" style="s2">figure out that he’s going from here to<br />here.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.309" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">Whereas if you train a rat to do this the<br />rat will figure out, to hell with all of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">circuitousness, it’s just going to go straight<br />from point a to point b. that finding was</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:18.940" style="s2">part of what indicated to early neuro-psychological<br />researchers that animals produced a map of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.940" end="00:29:20.120" style="s2">the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.120" end="00:29:24.619" style="s2">In some sense what we’re talking about when<br />we’re talking about these structures, the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.619" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">A to B structure, is a map.</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:30.260" style="s2">That’s another way you can look at it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.260" end="00:29:33.119" style="s2">So you’ve got this rat and it’s behaviors<br />are all chained together.</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.119" end="00:29:37.460" style="s2">So I already told you, I spoiled the story<br />in some sense, because I told you that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.460" end="00:29:39.840" style="s2">rat could learn to take a short cut.</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.840" end="00:29:45.609" style="s2">One of the earlier demonstrations of the independence<br />of rat learning from the reflex of conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.609" end="00:29:48.809" style="s2">was that - so let’s say you’ve trained<br />a rat to run down a maze.</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.809" end="00:29:53.299" style="s2">Okay so hypothetically it’s using it’s<br />front legs and it’s back legs and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.299" end="00:29:55.109" style="s2">learned to chain all of that together.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.109" end="00:29:57.269" style="s2">“Front leg, back leg, movement, turn left.</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.269" end="00:29:59.749" style="s2">Front let, back leg, movement, turn right.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.749" end="00:30:04.150" style="s2">Etc.” so then, what if you put the rat,<br />you tie up it’s back legs and you put him</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.150" end="00:30:08.350" style="s2">in a little rat wheel barrel, so it’s got<br />wheels instead of legs – it’s like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:10.269" style="s2">rat zooms through the maze.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.269" end="00:30:17.029" style="s2">So much for the reflex theory because obviously<br />you didn’t train the rat to use a cart with</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.029" end="00:30:21.610" style="s2">it’s rear-end stuck in it, it figured that<br />out all by itself.</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.610" end="00:30:26.650" style="s2">So anyways there is a system in you that allows<br />you to chain reflexes together.</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.650" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">It’s a very primordial reflex system and<br />the behaviorists got that right.</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:35.049" style="s2">It’s fast, very very fast, because it requires<br />few neural connections.</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.049" end="00:30:42.299" style="s2">So there are some advantages to simple learning<br />but once you get up to even the moderately</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.299" end="00:30:49.620" style="s2">higher cortical and sub-cortical functions,<br />you’re past the point of mere reflex chaining.</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.620" end="00:30:55.830" style="s2">Okay so, let’s for the sake of simplicity<br />the hypothalamus says, you need water.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.830" end="00:30:58.630" style="s2">So you’re current state is that you’re<br />thirsty and you’re desired state is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.630" end="00:30:59.879" style="s2">get to go to the tap.</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.879" end="00:31:05.119" style="s2">You can feel your mouth dry and so forth,<br />and some fantasies of drinking water start</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.119" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">to come to your mind, and then all of sudden<br />you’re kind of possessed by that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:15.109" style="s2">So it’s starting to interfere with your<br />conscious goal-directed behavior at that point,</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.109" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">and finally it’s insistent enough like something<br />knocking at the door so you think, man I’m</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:21.340" style="s2">thirsty.</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.340" end="00:31:25.940" style="s2">Maybe you enough think that you’ll work<br />better if you have something to drink.</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.940" end="00:31:30.820" style="s2">So you go off to the fountain, and what your<br />hippocampus is doing – you’ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.820" end="00:31:34.830" style="s2">little idea, which is your desired future<br />which is about how this trip is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.830" end="00:31:41.220" style="s2">go, and then you’re watching to see how<br />the trip is actually going, but that’s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">interpretation too.</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:47.389" style="s2">If there’s a match between the two then<br />the hippocampus just leaves you the hell alone</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.389" end="00:31:51.080" style="s2">and you don’t get anxious, you don’t get<br />knocked off the track.</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.080" end="00:31:56.700" style="s2">You go there, you have the water, that satiates<br />that system, that’s a form of reward it’s</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.700" end="00:32:00.529" style="s2">called consumeratory reward, and then that<br />systems disappears.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.529" end="00:32:05.529" style="s2">It goes back to the dungeons from which it<br />emerged and in all likelihood another one</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.529" end="00:32:06.529" style="s2">pops up.</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.529" end="00:32:12.639" style="s2">Now, it’s an oversimplification of human<br />behavior to assume that you just go from one</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.639" end="00:32:17.649" style="s2">hypothalamically mediated state to another,<br />although I would say that’s what two-year</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.649" end="00:32:19.249" style="s2">olds do.</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.249" end="00:32:21.340" style="s2">In some sense, that’s what animals do.</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.340" end="00:32:26.009" style="s2">The two-year old’s doing it because that<br />little creature hasn’t gotten any more organized</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.009" end="00:32:28.409" style="s2">than hypothalamic.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.409" end="00:32:30.130" style="s2">You can see this if you watch two year olds.</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.130" end="00:32:31.340" style="s2">It’s like they’re laughing and then they’re<br />crying.</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.340" end="00:32:34.749" style="s2">Then they’re hungry and then they’re hot<br />and then they need to go to the bathroom and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.749" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">then they want to play.</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:40.710" style="s2">It’s just one, pure, motivated or emotional<br />state after another.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.710" end="00:32:42.019" style="s2">It’s quite fun to watch.</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.019" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2">They’re also relatively hyper-exploratory<br />and playful.</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:51.899" style="s2">They’re cycling through those things all<br />of the time.</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.899" end="00:32:54.989" style="s2">So you can’t say that that’s really what<br />an adult human does.</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.989" end="00:33:03.340" style="s2">The reason for that is that the problem with<br />the pure – the reason you need a cortex</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.340" end="00:33:08.190" style="s2">and other sub-cortical structures that aren’t<br />hypothalamic is because the world is too complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.190" end="00:33:14.549" style="s2">for those primordial systems to solve the<br />problems they’re supposed to solve A, in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.549" end="00:33:21.489" style="s2">every possible situation, and B, across multiple<br />time frames, and C, in an environment that</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.489" end="00:33:26.019" style="s2">consists of the interactions between other<br />very complex beings.</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.019" end="00:33:34.909" style="s2">So it’s almost like an arm’s race of complexity<br />in some sense that’s driven our evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.909" end="00:33:40.099" style="s2">– the smarter you get in some sense the<br />more variable you get.</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.099" end="00:33:45.129" style="s2">That’s a problem because as I got smarter,<br />say over the course of evolution, well you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.129" end="00:33:46.649" style="s2">people got smarter too.</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.649" end="00:33:51.580" style="s2">We’re all competing and cooperating with<br />each other, so the whole damn system is getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.580" end="00:33:53.940" style="s2">more and more complex.</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.940" end="00:33:59.279" style="s2">You have to grow a brain in order to manage<br />that at least, or you keep it simple – well,</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.279" end="00:34:00.820" style="s2">we didn’t keep it simple.</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.820" end="00:34:02.899" style="s2">So we decided to grow a brain instead.</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.899" end="00:34:08.870" style="s2">I don’t know if you know this but you’ve<br />looked at a chimpanzee – they don’t look</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.870" end="00:34:10.520" style="s2">a lot like human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.520" end="00:34:15.639" style="s2">There are obviously some things in common,<br />their hands are quite human and their ears</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.639" end="00:34:21.100" style="s2">are quite human, but their forehead comes<br />down to about here, and they’re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.100" end="00:34:22.540" style="s2">shaped like this.</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.540" end="00:34:29.810" style="s2">They’ve got a huge, round body, and whereas<br />a human being is sort of like a stick with</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.810" end="00:34:33.930" style="s2">two sticks coming out of it, and two more<br />sticks – we’re really, really thin, hardly</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.930" end="00:34:35.630" style="s2">any gut.</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.630" end="00:34:41.120" style="s2">Whereas a chimpanzee, it’s intestinal structures<br />are way, way, way longer than ours.</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.120" end="00:34:43.300" style="s2">So it has to pack that into this huge gut.</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.300" end="00:34:47.800" style="s2">A damn chimpanzee sits around for eight hours<br />a day chewing.</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.800" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">The reason for that is it eats leaves.</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:53.630" style="s2">You go out into the forest and see how many<br />damn leaves you have to eat before you feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.630" end="00:34:54.980" style="s2">full.</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.980" end="00:34:57.962" style="s2">All the chimp does is sit there and chew leaves.</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.962" end="00:35:01.860" style="s2">Then it has this huge gut so it can extract<br />some nourishment out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.860" end="00:35:06.610" style="s2">We figured out how to solve that problem once<br />we discovered fire and hunting, because we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.610" end="00:35:09.140" style="s2">could cook things.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.140" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">That enabled us, at least in principle, to<br />trade gut for brain, which I think was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:20.340" style="s2">useful trade, all things considered, although<br />it still might get us into trouble.</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.340" end="00:35:23.370" style="s2">The brain’s a very energy-hungry organ.</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.370" end="00:35:28.020" style="s2">We eat very, very efficient food and it turns<br />out that cooked food is much more nutritious</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.020" end="00:35:32.660" style="s2">from a caloric perspective than raw food.</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.660" end="00:35:37.080" style="s2">You can afford to sit around and develop a<br />brain if you’ve got high-quality food.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.080" end="00:35:42.350" style="s2">Otherwise you’re out there in the jungle<br />chewing on leaves like an idiot, it’s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.350" end="00:35:43.590" style="s2">about as bad as pandas.</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.590" end="00:35:46.300" style="s2">Do you know why those things are damn near<br />extinct?</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.300" end="00:35:49.810" style="s2">They used to be carnivores but all they eat<br />is bamboo shoots now.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.810" end="00:35:52.510" style="s2">That’s it, nothing else, bamboo shoots.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.510" end="00:35:57.780" style="s2">They have no nutrition so they have to eat<br />bamboo shoots all day.</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.780" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">Now and then the bamboo crop fails and there<br />aren’t any shoots.</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:02.690" style="s2">It’s like, so much for the pandas.</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.690" end="00:36:08.210" style="s2">If an animal ever deserved to go extinct it<br />was definitely the panda.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.210" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">Hunt something, the lazy bastards!</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:19.180" style="s2">Anyways, now I discovered this about the hypothalamus<br />when I was ready Larry Swanson, it just bloody-well</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.180" end="00:36:23.650" style="s2">blew me away, you’ll see why, at least in<br />part.</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.650" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">Half of the hypothalamus, roughly speaking,<br />is sort of devoted to popping up these basic,</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:33.240" style="s2">primal sub-personalities; the sorts of things<br />that you share with animals.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.240" end="00:36:36.590" style="s2">Then you might say, what happens when one<br />of those doesn’t work?</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.590" end="00:36:39.700" style="s2">The answer is, well you get an anxiety response.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.700" end="00:36:45.020" style="s2">Now, the anxiety response is not mediated<br />by the hypothalamus, and neither is pain.</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.020" end="00:36:51.110" style="s2">So, if you’re an idiot your body hurts you<br />or tells you or scares you.</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.110" end="00:36:57.170" style="s2">What’s interesting about that is the pain<br />systems and the anxiety systems are not in</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.170" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">the hypothalamus, they’re separate systems.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">The pain system is old, old, old.</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.090" style="s2">It may be as old as the hypothalamus, it’s<br />way down there in your brain.</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.090" end="00:37:10.850" style="s2">But, the anxiety system is a lot newer and<br />that kind of makes sense.</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.850" end="00:37:15.330" style="s2">You can imagine the primordial organisms really<br />didn’t stop until they ran into something</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.330" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">that was hurting them.”</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:21.670" style="s2">They couldn’t think, “oh no, I might run<br />into something that will hurt me.</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.670" end="00:37:25.490" style="s2">You can’t think that roughly until you have<br />an amygdala.</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.490" end="00:37:30.920" style="s2">The amygdala is responsible for lots of things,<br />and all of these areas are interconnected.</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.920" end="00:37:35.510" style="s2">One of the things it seems to be responsible<br />for, at least impart, is anxiety.</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.510" end="00:37:42.120" style="s2">When your hippocampus detects a mismatch between<br />what you want to have happen and what is happening,</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.120" end="00:37:45.900" style="s2">it disinhibits the reticular activating system,<br />and one of the things it activates is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.900" end="00:37:46.900" style="s2">anxiety system.</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.900" end="00:37:51.360" style="s2">The anxiety system says, “stop, you idiot,<br />you don’t know where you are or what you’re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.360" end="00:37:54.050" style="s2">doing and so you should quit before you get<br />into trouble.”</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.050" end="00:38:00.410" style="s2">We don’t like that feeling very much, that<br />freezes us, but it’s better than pain.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.410" end="00:38:03.470" style="s2">You feel anxiety so you don’t have to feel<br />pain.</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.470" end="00:38:13.110" style="s2">Pain seems to occur when you encounter a stimulus,<br />let’s say a situation, where the stimulus</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.110" end="00:38:18.850" style="s2">magnitude is sufficient to damage those parts<br />of you that are encountering it – so too</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.850" end="00:38:25.260" style="s2">bright a light, too hot a flame, too cold<br />a piece of metal, too hot food, whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.260" end="00:38:30.200" style="s2">If it’s of sufficient magnitude to damage<br />you, you get a pain response out of that.</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:34.460" style="s2">The pain response is supposed to teach the<br />part of you that moves forward, not to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.460" end="00:38:35.530" style="s2">that again.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.530" end="00:38:39.580" style="s2">The anxiety system responds to cues of pain.</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.580" end="00:38:43.310" style="s2">The pain system is pretty complicated as well.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.310" end="00:38:46.600" style="s2">Frustration is a pain-like stimulus.</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.600" end="00:38:49.060" style="s2">Disappointment is a pain-like stimulus.</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.060" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">Grief and loneliness are pain-like stimuli.</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:54.520" style="s2">Depression is probably a pain condition.</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.520" end="00:39:00.450" style="s2">So even though the pain system is quite primordial,<br />it’s grown up like a complex tree, and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.450" end="00:39:03.620" style="s2">consumes many different functions.</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.620" end="00:39:10.820" style="s2">It’s still a very ancient system, whereas<br />the amygdalian system, which is newer, you’ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.820" end="00:39:15.330" style="s2">developed over time to tell you what might<br />hurt you so that you can avoid contacting</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.330" end="00:39:16.330" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.330" end="00:39:20.860" style="s2">You’ve got your hypothalamus and it’s<br />telling you – it’s laying out these little</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.860" end="00:39:25.300" style="s2">sub-personalities that are helping you deal<br />with the fundamental necessities of the word.</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.300" end="00:39:30.540" style="s2">The pain system is there to tell you when<br />you have encountered a situation that’s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.540" end="00:39:35.640" style="s2">harmful, the anxiety system is there to tell<br />you when you might going to encounter something</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.640" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">harmful.</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:39.770" style="s2">That’s the thing that’s activated when<br />there’s a mismatch.</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.770" end="00:39:45.090" style="s2">The mismatch says you don’t know where you<br />are or where you’re going, and so you might</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.090" end="00:39:46.850" style="s2">get hurt.</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.850" end="00:39:52.600" style="s2">The other thing that happens, roughly speaking,<br />is that when the hippocampus disinhibits the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.600" end="00:39:58.710" style="s2">reticular activating system that turns the<br />other half of the hypothalamus on.</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.710" end="00:40:04.530" style="s2">This is quite cool because the other half<br />of the hypothalamus is the place where the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.530" end="00:40:07.300" style="s2">ventral tegmental area is located.</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.300" end="00:40:12.100" style="s2">The ventral tegmental area is the part of<br />the brain where the dopaminergic tracks emerge,</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.100" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">and those are the tracks that you use A, to<br />explore, and B, to respond to cues of consumatory</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:20.930" style="s2">reward.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.930" end="00:40:26.850" style="s2">So what that means in non-technical language<br />is that when you encounter mismatch you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.850" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">anxious, which is what you should do, you<br />should stop, something’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:36.590" style="s2">As long as nothing else happens that’s painful<br />or threatening, than that system starts to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.590" end="00:40:41.350" style="s2">acclimatize, partly because you’re looking<br />around and thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.350" end="00:40:43.850" style="s2">People often talk about this as habituation.</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.850" end="00:40:45.900" style="s2">That’s a stupid idea.</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.900" end="00:40:48.420" style="s2">It’s habituation if you’re a sea slug.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.420" end="00:40:53.700" style="s2">It’s not a habituation if you’re a person,<br />except that in very, very primordial reflex-like</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.700" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">levels of the nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:40:59.330" style="s2">At the higher order levels that we’re talking<br />about, it’s learning.</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.330" end="00:41:02.110" style="s2">If you stop and you’re anxious, what happens?</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.110" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">Well, generally speaking, you start thinking,<br />what the hell might be going on?</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:11.150" style="s2">You’re running through all of these different<br />theories and part of the way that works is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.150" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">that it’s partly a consequence of state-dependent<br />learning.</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:22.700" style="s2">If you’re anxious you’re going to be primed<br />to remember situations that you were anxious</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.700" end="00:41:24.250" style="s2">in before.</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.250" end="00:41:25.550" style="s2">Why should you do that?</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.550" end="00:41:33.190" style="s2">The reason for that is that “things that<br />make you anxious” is a category.</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.190" end="00:41:35.120" style="s2">It’s actually a category.</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.120" end="00:41:39.790" style="s2">We tend to think of categories as something<br />that exists in the objective world.</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.790" end="00:41:42.470" style="s2">That is not how your brain categorizes things.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.470" end="00:41:47.840" style="s2">You have to learn that really painfully to<br />make objective categorizations.</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.840" end="00:41:52.850" style="s2">As far as your natural nervous system is concerned<br />all things that go “bump” in the night</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.850" end="00:41:54.910" style="s2">are the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.910" end="00:41:55.910" style="s2">What is that?</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.910" end="00:42:02.020" style="s2">It’s some bloody, horrible predatory, crocodilian,<br />dragon-like, monster that hides under your</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.020" end="00:42:05.050" style="s2">bed and comes out and bites you when you’re<br />three.</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.050" end="00:42:10.550" style="s2">I just read a little paper today about this<br />kind of cat that lived back when were still</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.550" end="00:42:12.590" style="s2">figuring out how to use spears.</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.590" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">This was a particularly nasty kind of cat,<br />and it preyed on us, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:23.060" style="s2">We didn’t get eaten by too many cats because<br />cats really can’t bite through the skull.</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.060" end="00:42:26.370" style="s2">They could go for your neck but they didn’t<br />necessarily kill you.</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.370" end="00:42:30.970" style="s2">This cat had a mouth that fit right around<br />your skull and it had two teeth that went</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.970" end="00:42:33.180" style="s2">in here and two teeth that went in here.</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.180" end="00:42:35.430" style="s2">It was a silent killer.</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.430" end="00:42:41.090" style="s2">There is evidence that even children are capable<br />of recognizing the motion in pattern of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.090" end="00:42:47.400" style="s2">predatory cat, and one of the hypotheses is<br />that we still have all of our primate ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.400" end="00:42:49.510" style="s2">that didn’t get eaten by that particular<br />cat.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.510" end="00:42:57.430" style="s2">We’re pretty damn good at detecting cats,<br />at least of that type, and we seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.430" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">conserved that ability at least to some degree.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:07.160" style="s2">You think about a category, you might think<br />well there’s fish and there’s birds and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.160" end="00:43:12.800" style="s2">there’s mammals and there’s reptiles,<br />those are Linnaean classifications, they’re</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.800" end="00:43:16.500" style="s2">based in some sense on Evolutionary divergence.</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.500" end="00:43:21.170" style="s2">Where they’re not, on morphology.</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.170" end="00:43:23.430" style="s2">Who cares about that?</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.430" end="00:43:27.810" style="s2">Things that eat you, that’s a category.</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.810" end="00:43:29.380" style="s2">You need that category.</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.380" end="00:43:32.470" style="s2">The other category is also things that might<br />eat you.</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.470" end="00:43:37.430" style="s2">So things that eat you, those are things that<br />can hurt you and the things that might eat</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.430" end="00:43:40.670" style="s2">you are things you haven’t classified yet,<br />but might be dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.670" end="00:43:45.120" style="s2">That’s your brain’s natural category;<br />one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.120" end="00:43:49.320" style="s2">Then you might think well if that’s the<br />natural category, see that’s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.320" end="00:44:01.480" style="s2">thing that the guy that wrote An Ecological<br />Approach on Vision Perception, he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.480" end="00:44:04.340" style="s2">as an affordance.</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.340" end="00:44:09.880" style="s2">An affordance is something who’s meaning<br />you instantly perceive.</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.880" end="00:44:14.080" style="s2">So you might say, “No, no, no, you see a<br />cat.”</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.080" end="00:44:16.730" style="s2">Then you infer that it might eat you.</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.730" end="00:44:20.760" style="s2">No, you see something that might eat you,<br />and then you might be able to figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.760" end="00:44:21.800" style="s2">it’s a cat.</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.800" end="00:44:27.770" style="s2">It’s the “might eat you” that you see<br />first, no the damn cat.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.770" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">This is a fascinating phenomenon because it<br />suggests, like the Heidigerians proposed,</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:41.870" style="s2">that what you perceive first in the world<br />is meanings and out of the meanings you extract</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.870" end="00:44:42.870" style="s2">objects.</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.870" end="00:44:45.130" style="s2">It’s not the other way around.</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.130" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">If you look at the way your brain is organized,<br />that’s how it works folks.</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:56.620" style="s2">The more primordial your brain system is,<br />which means the more ancient it is, the more</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.620" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">its perception is action predicated.</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:04.810" style="s2">So for example, if you hear a loud noise behind<br />you and you startle, that’s your response.</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.810" end="00:45:10.650" style="s2">So you’re going into a crouch where it would<br />be difficult for a tiger to bite your neck.</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.650" end="00:45:15.330" style="s2">You do that, man that’s way before your<br />thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.330" end="00:45:18.890" style="s2">It’s before your perceiving, consciously.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.890" end="00:45:22.100" style="s2">You’re not getting images or sounds at that<br />point.</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.100" end="00:45:23.710" style="s2">It’s so quick.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.710" end="00:45:27.580" style="s2">That’s a category: things that make you<br />go like this.</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.580" end="00:45:29.710" style="s2">That’s a good category.</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.710" end="00:45:32.860" style="s2">The reason I’m making such a case about<br />that category is because that’s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.860" end="00:45:38.050" style="s2">mythological categories: Things that go bump<br />in the night.</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.050" end="00:45:42.790" style="s2">One of the things that primordial people were<br />trying to figure out is – you could think</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.790" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">of any old animal as figuring out how to escape<br />from a predator.</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:49.880" style="s2">That isn’t what human beings wanted to figure<br />out.</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.880" end="00:45:52.740" style="s2">Not once we were able to abstract.</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.740" end="00:45:57.580" style="s2">What we wanted to do instead was to figure<br />out how to escape from the class of all things</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.580" end="00:46:02.270" style="s2">that could eat you; not just any particular<br />old thing, but all of them at once.</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.270" end="00:46:04.520" style="s2">That’s the advantage to categorization.</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.520" end="00:46:07.720" style="s2">Can we arrange things so that nothing could<br />eat us?</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.720" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">How do you go about doing that?</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.540" style="s2">Believe me, we’ve been working on that problem<br />for a very, very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.540" end="00:46:17.131" style="s2">One of the answers we came up with, we’ll<br />get into this later, is the idea of sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.131" end="00:46:21.290" style="s2">Sacrifice is a very, very ancient idea.</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.290" end="00:46:23.580" style="s2">I’ll just give you a bit of a preview.</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.580" end="00:46:28.750" style="s2">It took me like twenty years to figure this<br />out.</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.750" end="00:46:31.120" style="s2">Human beings discovered sacrifice a long time<br />ago.</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.120" end="00:46:33.950" style="s2">They acted it out before they understood it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.950" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">We act out lots of things before we understand<br />them.</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:40.450" style="s2">The idea is sort of well we can make a bargain<br />with God.</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.450" end="00:46:42.070" style="s2">You might say, well what’s God?</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.070" end="00:46:46.280" style="s2">We’ll approach that problem later, it’s<br />a very complicated problem.</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.280" end="00:46:53.711" style="s2">One thing you could think of God as, is, God<br />is the anthropomorphic representation of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.711" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">entire social structure across time.</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:00.860" style="s2">You might say, well God will reward you if<br />you behave properly.</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.860" end="00:47:02.380" style="s2">What does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.380" end="00:47:08.500" style="s2">Imagine you could conceive of everyone that<br />wasn’t you as one metaperson.</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.500" end="00:47:11.060" style="s2">Imagine that that metaperson is God.</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.060" end="00:47:12.460" style="s2">You can make a deal with that thing.</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.460" end="00:47:19.820" style="s2">You can say if I behave properly that metabeing<br />will respond positively to me in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.820" end="00:47:21.260" style="s2">It’s true, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.260" end="00:47:22.260" style="s2">You know that.</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.260" end="00:47:27.500" style="s2">If you make a promise to someone and you keep<br />it, something good is likely going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.500" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">to you in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:34.660" style="s2">So that’s a God the Father derivation – it’s<br />far more complicated than that, but that’s</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.660" end="00:47:35.970" style="s2">not a bad point.</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.970" end="00:47:41.540" style="s2">We kind of figured out that we could bargain<br />with it across time and that would work.</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.540" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">I read a really interesting paper by someone<br />who’s actually a former student of mine,</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.970" style="s2">Azim Shariff, and he analyzed the relationship<br />between criminal behavior and belief in Hell</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.970" end="00:47:53.030" style="s2">across a whole set of countries.</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.030" end="00:47:57.890" style="s2">I don’t know if it was an exhaustive analysis,<br />correlational analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.890" end="00:48:03.210" style="s2">It’s way more peaceful in countries where<br />people believe in hell.</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.210" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">You think should you believe in hell?</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:09.310" style="s2">Yes and no.</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.310" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">Atheist arguments aside, we’re not even<br />going to bother with them because they’re</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:16.220" style="s2">kind of moronic.</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.220" end="00:48:22.830" style="s2">The idea here is that there are certain action<br />patterns that if you undertake, you will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.830" end="00:48:26.740" style="s2">viciously punished in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.740" end="00:48:31.070" style="s2">You try lying to everyone you meet and see<br />how well you’ll do in a twenty-year period.</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.070" end="00:48:35.820" style="s2">You’re going to be in such trouble by the<br />end of that twenty-year period that hell will</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.820" end="00:48:39.880" style="s2">be the only accurate way to describe where<br />you’re situated.</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:45.890" style="s2">So it’s no joke these are real things and<br />people came up with these ideas for a reason.</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.890" end="00:48:50.520" style="s2">Hell isn’t only where other people put you<br />if you’re bad, it’s a lot more profound</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.520" end="00:48:51.840" style="s2">a concept than that.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.840" end="00:48:53.650" style="s2">That’s not a bad start.</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.650" end="00:48:58.820" style="s2">Anyways, the sacrificial notion was something<br />like we cannot do what we want to do right</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.820" end="00:49:02.170" style="s2">now and do something else, and that will make<br />things better in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.170" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">Think about that people.</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:07.650" style="s2">That’s the most brilliant idea human beings<br />ever came up with.</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.650" end="00:49:11.950" style="s2">There’s this old story, which is probably<br />not true, about how to catch a monkey.</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.950" end="00:49:17.480" style="s2">You get this jar that’s got a pretty thin<br />neck.</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.480" end="00:49:21.080" style="s2">Just big enough for a monkey to put its hand<br />in, and you fill it with things monkeys like</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.080" end="00:49:22.080" style="s2">to eat.</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.080" end="00:49:24.470" style="s2">Let’s say hard candy for the sake of argument.</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.470" end="00:49:28.340" style="s2">So you put that out there and the monkey goes<br />and sticks its hand in and grabs a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.340" end="00:49:29.340" style="s2">candy.</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.340" end="00:49:33.171" style="s2">It can’t get its damn hand out because it’s<br />only big enough for it to put its hand in.</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.171" end="00:49:34.610" style="s2">so then you can just go and pick up the monkey.</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.610" end="00:49:37.240" style="s2">Well, what’s the problem with the monkey?</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.240" end="00:49:39.220" style="s2">It can’t sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.220" end="00:49:44.250" style="s2">It won’t sacrifice its grip on the damn<br />candy for its future existence.</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.250" end="00:49:48.390" style="s2">That’s what your parents have been teaching<br />you ever since you were little kids.</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.390" end="00:49:51.150" style="s2">Let go of the candy so that you can live.</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.150" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">That’s delay of gratification, right?</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:59.220" style="s2">That’s contentiousness, that’s the discovery<br />of time and its relationship to the social</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.220" end="00:50:00.220" style="s2">environment.</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.220" end="00:50:02.550" style="s2">It’s so brilliant.</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.550" end="00:50:05.690" style="s2">Part of what people were trying to figure<br />out when they were developing these rituals</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.690" end="00:50:11.140" style="s2">of sacrifice is – okay, so you think about<br />society as a meta-person, it’s usually represented</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.140" end="00:50:15.450" style="s2">as male by the way, but not always, it depends<br />on the circumstances.</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.450" end="00:50:18.820" style="s2">So what does this meta-person want?</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.820" end="00:50:20.310" style="s2">You have to try to figure that out.</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.310" end="00:50:26.460" style="s2">Part of what it wants is – don’t eat all<br />the damn grain today, save some for next year,</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.460" end="00:50:27.480" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.480" end="00:50:32.540" style="s2">Act as if the future exists as part of the<br />social contact.</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.540" end="00:50:36.210" style="s2">God, that’s such a discovery man.</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.210" end="00:50:39.600" style="s2">It’s only people who figured that out.</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.600" end="00:50:45.240" style="s2">I mean squirrels have kind of got it in some<br />sense because they store nuts, and squirrels</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.240" end="00:50:46.560" style="s2">are smart.</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.560" end="00:50:48.910" style="s2">They just kind of got the inkling of it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.910" end="00:50:52.710" style="s2">I think what squirrels do is they eat all<br />of the nuts they can possibly eat right now,</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.710" end="00:50:54.450" style="s2">and then they store the rest of them.</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.450" end="00:50:58.089" style="s2">It wouldn’t go hungry if you store nuts<br />for the future, human beings will do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.089" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">– don’t eat the seed grain, right?</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:03.740" style="s2">Then you’re going to die next year.</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.740" end="00:51:07.270" style="s2">Alright, so back to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.270" end="00:51:11.869" style="s2">Now, you’re doing something you want to<br />do and you’re tracking how that’s going</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.869" end="00:51:15.260" style="s2">– both of those are hypotheses, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.260" end="00:51:18.110" style="s2">All of a sudden something happens that you<br />don’t want to have happen, like you live</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.110" end="00:51:19.870" style="s2">in Flint, Michigan for example.</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.870" end="00:51:24.420" style="s2">So you decide to go have some water and it<br />turns out that it’s not water at all, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.420" end="00:51:25.420" style="s2">led.</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.420" end="00:51:30.560" style="s2">I don’t know if you guys know about that,<br />but it’s just the sort of thing that makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.560" end="00:51:31.990" style="s2">your jaw drop.</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.990" end="00:51:35.530" style="s2">The state is in big trouble – Michigan.</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.530" end="00:51:41.500" style="s2">So they appointed an auditor to control finances,<br />I believe at the state level.</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.500" end="00:51:44.360" style="s2">It might have been only at the city level,<br />but it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.360" end="00:51:45.520" style="s2">Let’s say the state level.</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.520" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">So the auditor was looking for ways to save<br />money and one of the ways they decided to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">save money was to hook up Flint, Michigan’s<br />water supply to a river instead of to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:57.180" style="s2">great lake, which is what it’s right beside.</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.180" end="00:52:03.190" style="s2">Turns out, since Flint was an industrial center<br />forever, that the water’s just full of led.</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.190" end="00:52:07.970" style="s2">So now they have something like fifty thousand<br />led-poisoned people living in Flint, Michigan.</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.970" end="00:52:09.660" style="s2">That is not a good thing.</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.660" end="00:52:14.610" style="s2">Led lowers your IQ rapidly and it makes you<br />violent.</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.610" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">For the ten thousand dollars they saved they<br />probably cost themselves half a million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:20.200" style="s2">per person.</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.200" end="00:52:26.150" style="s2">It wasn’t actually that there was led in<br />the water it was that the water was more acidic.</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.150" end="00:52:29.510" style="s2">Oh, it took the led out of the pipes, yeah,<br />good point.</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.510" end="00:52:34.900" style="s2">Well I’m not here to complain about Michigan<br />politicians, the point is, is that just because</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.900" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">you think you’re out for a drink of water<br />that does not necessarily mean that’s what’s</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:39.960" style="s2">going on.</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.960" end="00:52:45.020" style="s2">That’s why I said that you’re comparing<br />your vision of the future to what you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.020" end="00:52:46.620" style="s2">is going on right now.</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.620" end="00:52:53.500" style="s2">Now if you read the neuropsychologists like<br />Vinagradova, Sokolov and Jeffrey Gray, they’re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.500" end="00:52:54.950" style="s2">basically behaviorists.</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.950" end="00:52:59.910" style="s2">So what they tell you is this – and this<br />is different – what they tell you is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.910" end="00:53:04.620" style="s2">have this little expectancy map that’s like<br />the rat has of its surroundings – it’s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.620" end="00:53:06.630" style="s2">a spatio-temporal map.</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.630" end="00:53:11.090" style="s2">So when you’re doing something, you expect<br />a certain outcome, okay.</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.090" end="00:53:15.990" style="s2">What you compare that to is reality as it<br />unfolds.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.990" end="00:53:20.490" style="s2">So you could say, so you’ve got this map<br />and then stimuli appear to you, and those</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.490" end="00:53:21.840" style="s2">are objectively real.</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.840" end="00:53:23.460" style="s2">No, that’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.460" end="00:53:24.540" style="s2">It’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.540" end="00:53:27.340" style="s2">It’s interpretation everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.340" end="00:53:31.220" style="s2">You think you know what’s going on right<br />now and you think you know what you want.</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.220" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">The reason I’m making such a big deal out<br />of this is because look, if you’re a rat</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:39.601" style="s2">and you’re going about your business and<br />something you don’t want happens, according</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.601" end="00:53:47.880" style="s2">to the Gray Behaviorist model, you have to<br />revamp your expectancy map.</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.880" end="00:53:51.330" style="s2">According to the model that I’m proposing<br />it’s way worse than that, because you don’t</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.330" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">know where the damn error is.</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:57.590" style="s2">It might be in the map of what you want, not<br />what you expect, that’s a different thing,</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.590" end="00:54:02.120" style="s2">but it also might be in the map you have that’s<br />of the present.</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.120" end="00:54:07.430" style="s2">So it’s not just the map that you have that’s<br />a prediction of your actions that’s at fault,</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.430" end="00:54:10.760" style="s2">it could easily be the way you’re construing<br />the world right now.</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.760" end="00:54:17.500" style="s2">It could be error at any level of behavior<br />and so what it means is when an anomaly occurs,</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.500" end="00:54:24.230" style="s2">it spreads doubt through the entire hierarchy<br />that we were describing including the future,</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.230" end="00:54:27.100" style="s2">the present and even the past.</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.100" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">You know this, you know this perfectly well.</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:33.240" style="s2">You can see it when you encounter complex<br />anomaly.</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.240" end="00:54:38.840" style="s2">So a complex anomaly would be you have a long-term<br />relationship and you get betrayed.</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.840" end="00:54:44.030" style="s2">So betrayed means you’ve trusted someone<br />and they enticed you to do so, and then they</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.030" end="00:54:47.420" style="s2">exploit that trust and hurt you.</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.420" end="00:54:51.360" style="s2">For Dante, the betrayers were in the lowest<br />circle of hell.</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.360" end="00:54:55.350" style="s2">So it’s a particularly nasty thing to do<br />to people.</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.350" end="00:54:59.890" style="s2">If you think about trust as the precondition<br />for interpersonal relationships, which it</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.890" end="00:55:05.180" style="s2">is, then if someone acts towards you in a<br />way that violates your trust in trust, then</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.180" end="00:55:08.800" style="s2">they’ve done you the worst disservice that<br />someone could possibly be done.</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.800" end="00:55:10.770" style="s2">Okay, so you get betrayed.</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.770" end="00:55:11.770" style="s2">Alright so, bang!</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.770" end="00:55:12.930" style="s2">That’s an anomaly.</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.930" end="00:55:14.840" style="s2">What does it imply?</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.840" end="00:55:17.290" style="s2">That’s the wrong question.</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.290" end="00:55:20.840" style="s2">The right question is, what doesn’t it imply?</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.840" end="00:55:25.070" style="s2">It implies that you just don’t have the<br />foggiest notion of what you’re doing or</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.070" end="00:55:28.500" style="s2">what human beings are like.</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.500" end="00:55:32.190" style="s2">Especially if it’s a particularly vicious<br />betrayal, maybe you’ve been suckered by</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.190" end="00:55:37.250" style="s2">a psychopath, it’s like, okay, update your<br />model and account for that – good luck,</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.250" end="00:55:39.210" style="s2">especially if you’re naive.</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.210" end="00:55:44.770" style="s2">The probability that you’ll be able to reach<br />down into the depths far enough to come up</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.770" end="00:55:49.690" style="s2">with a coherent explanation for why someone<br />would do that is very, very low.</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.690" end="00:55:54.260" style="s2">What I’ve discovered in my clinical practice<br />is that if you get betrayed badly enough,</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.260" end="00:55:59.130" style="s2">the only language that you can use to describe<br />it is fundamentally religious.</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.130" end="00:56:02.930" style="s2">At some points of betrayal it’s good versus<br />evil.</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.930" end="00:56:04.270" style="s2">It’s malevolence.</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.270" end="00:56:08.710" style="s2">It’s the malevolence that really traumatizes<br />people.</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.710" end="00:56:12.420" style="s2">It’s the fact that that person was out to<br />hurt you.</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.420" end="00:56:15.560" style="s2">What’s a human being like when they’re<br />capable of that?</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.560" end="00:56:17.360" style="s2">It’s an age-old question.</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.360" end="00:56:20.930" style="s2">I’ll tell you something weird and interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.930" end="00:56:27.820" style="s2">There’s this old idea in Genesis, one of<br />the first ideas in Genesis, is that God made</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.820" end="00:56:29.980" style="s2">people a paradise to live in.</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.980" end="00:56:35.260" style="s2">Let’s just be wild about this for a moment,<br />and assume that your little model when it’s</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.260" end="00:56:37.350" style="s2">going well is a little paradise, right?</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.350" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">The world’s turning out the way you want<br />it to.</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:45.600" style="s2">There’s a snake in there somewhere, and<br />that means – well, why is there a snake?</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.600" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">There’s a bunch of things you’re not paying<br />attention to while you’re going about your</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:50.050" style="s2">business, right?</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.050" end="00:56:52.940" style="s2">In fact, there are almost an infinite number<br />of things that you’re not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.940" end="00:56:53.940" style="s2">to.</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.940" end="00:56:56.740" style="s2">The problem is that one of those infinite<br />number of things that you’re not paying</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.740" end="00:56:59.570" style="s2">attention to can shift on you all of a sudden.</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.570" end="00:57:02.970" style="s2">So there’s always this snake in the garden.</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.970" end="00:57:05.140" style="s2">Then you have to figure out what to do with<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.140" end="00:57:09.400" style="s2">The thing is, if you interact with the snake<br />you get more conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.400" end="00:57:11.560" style="s2">The problem with that is you lose your little<br />paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.560" end="00:57:16.170" style="s2">Okay, well it’s worse than that, because<br />that story is really old.</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.170" end="00:57:17.920" style="s2">We have no idea how old it is.</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.920" end="00:57:23.810" style="s2">It’s disseminated all over the world, or<br />it emerged independently in different places,</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.810" end="00:57:24.810" style="s2">we don’t really know.</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.810" end="00:57:26.310" style="s2">In any case it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.310" end="00:57:30.990" style="s2">It’s a fundamental enough story – tree<br />plus snake plus people – that no matter</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.990" end="00:57:34.830" style="s2">where you go some people have tree snake stories.</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.830" end="00:57:39.110" style="s2">I think that’s because we lived in trees<br />for like thirty million years and we got eaten</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.110" end="00:57:40.830" style="s2">by an awful lot of snakes.</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.830" end="00:57:44.380" style="s2">So it’s a story that really appeals to us.</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.380" end="00:57:48.780" style="s2">Every bloody science fiction movie you go<br />to most of the time if the aliens are bad,</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.780" end="00:57:50.210" style="s2">they’re always reptilian.</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.210" end="00:57:56.440" style="s2">You don’t get furry little koala aliens<br />that are chasing you around, it’s like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.440" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">one’s an alien.</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:03.830" style="s2">A reptile inside a reptile, they’re nasty<br />beasts, and they come out inside of you even.</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.830" end="00:58:06.010" style="s2">Which is another symbolic idea.</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.010" end="00:58:12.780" style="s2">Okay, so you’ve always got the damn snake,<br />and it’s popping out all of the time, and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.780" end="00:58:16.040" style="s2">there’s nothing you can do about it except<br />getting ready to deal with snakes, no getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.040" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">rid of them.</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:20.980" style="s2">So that’ the first lesson, you’re not<br />getting rid of the damn snakes.</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.980" end="00:58:22.710" style="s2">You better learn to deal with them.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.710" end="00:58:27.480" style="s2">Then the next question is, what is the worst<br />possible snake?</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.480" end="00:58:32.180" style="s2">One of the things that happened in Christianity,<br />and this was influenced in part by Zoroastrianism,</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.180" end="00:58:37.590" style="s2">was the idea of almost an independent evil<br />arose.</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.590" end="00:58:42.740" style="s2">In fact there was a branch of Christianity<br />called Manichaeism, that construed the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.740" end="00:58:47.320" style="s2">as a battle between good and evil where good<br />and evil had equal reality.</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.320" end="00:58:48.600" style="s2">They were in this eternal battle.</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.600" end="00:58:55.070" style="s2">Now that got wiped out by the standard Christian<br />theory that evil was actually just the absence</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.070" end="00:58:59.600" style="s2">of good, which anyways you could have a big<br />debate about that and people have for thousands</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.600" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">of years.</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:06.080" style="s2">As Christianity developed, there’s this<br />weird mythology that grew up around the weird</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.080" end="00:59:07.150" style="s2">myth of Genesis.</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.150" end="00:59:13.420" style="s2">The weird mythology was that the snake in<br />the Garden of Eden was also Satan, and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.420" end="00:59:15.110" style="s2">he’s the king of all evil.</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.110" end="00:59:16.430" style="s2">Okay, what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.430" end="00:59:17.690" style="s2">It’s pretty straight- forward.</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.690" end="00:59:20.740" style="s2">What’s the worst predator?</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.740" end="00:59:24.380" style="s2">Well that’s easy, the worst predator is<br />a human being.</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.380" end="00:59:28.790" style="s2">The worst of all possible snakes is the most<br />malevolent possible being.</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.790" end="00:59:33.230" style="s2">That’s exactly right, and that’s why that<br />association was made.</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.230" end="00:59:38.020" style="s2">It’s so interesting because it took people<br />thousands of years to make that association.</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.020" end="00:59:44.980" style="s2">It wasn’t really put together well until<br />Milton formalized in Paradise Lost.</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.980" end="00:59:49.190" style="s2">We kind of observe this in action, that there<br />were bad people.</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.190" end="00:59:51.640" style="s2">Okay, so bad is a category.</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.640" end="00:59:53.810" style="s2">What does bad entail?</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.810" end="00:59:59.380" style="s2">Mythologies of evil center in on what constitutes<br />bad.</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.380" end="01:00:04.430" style="s2">Carnivorous might be one of the things; malevolent,<br />out to hurt, right?</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.430" end="01:00:09.410" style="s2">Betrayal, lying, and all of the cardinal great<br />sins.</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.410" end="01:00:11.410" style="s2">That’s the worst snake.</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.410" end="01:00:14.690" style="s2">It’s a psychologization of the idea of the<br />predator.</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.690" end="01:00:21.120" style="s2">It’s even more sophisticated than that,<br />because one branch of that theory is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.120" end="01:00:26.680" style="s2">the worst predator is the evil force outside<br />of you, but the next branch of that is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.680" end="01:00:30.060" style="s2">the worst predator is the evil force within<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.060" end="01:00:34.040" style="s2">Yeah, well that’s when it gets really psychologized.</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.040" end="01:00:37.760" style="s2">You think, well is that superstition?</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.760" end="01:00:41.510" style="s2">Hey, that’s not superstition boys and girls,<br />it’s a lot more intelligent than that.</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.510" end="01:00:46.870" style="s2">It’s the most sophisticated theory of the<br />way things work that we have and it’s correct.</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.870" end="01:00:51.690" style="s2">Now what that means from a metaphysical perspective,<br />we’re not going to talk about that because</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.690" end="01:00:57.070" style="s2">we can, but we can certainly talk about what<br />it means in practical Darwinian terms.</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.070" end="01:01:01.530" style="s2">You better know what’s after you, and the<br />worst thing that could possibly be after you</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.530" end="01:01:06.360" style="s2">is a fully motivated and completely malevolent<br />human being.</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.360" end="01:01:09.440" style="s2">Skull-crushing cats be damned.</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.440" end="01:01:13.570" style="s2">All they want to do is eat you, they’re<br />not going to torture you; whereas if you fall</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.570" end="01:01:17.530" style="s2">into the hands of the wrong human being man,<br />you could be in excruciating pain for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.530" end="01:01:19.360" style="s2">next twenty years.</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.360" end="01:01:23.550" style="s2">So people are very imaginative if they figure<br />out how to hurt someone.</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.550" end="01:01:29.030" style="s2">They can keep it up for a long time, and they’re<br />fully motivated to do so under some conditions.</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.030" end="01:01:33.820" style="s2">So you really got to watch out for that.</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.820" end="01:01:35.530" style="s2">Alright so back to the hypothalamus.</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.530" end="01:01:42.590" style="s2">So when you have a mismatch between what you<br />desire and what you’re after, then the hippocampus</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.590" end="01:01:45.660" style="s2">says, “uh, we don’t know where we are.”</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.660" end="01:01:46.660" style="s2">That’s what it says.</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.660" end="01:01:48.250" style="s2">You no longer know where you are.</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.250" end="01:01:50.620" style="s2">Okay, what should you do when you don’t<br />know where you are?</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.620" end="01:01:52.420" style="s2">You should stop moving.</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.420" end="01:01:54.580" style="s2">Then you should – well then what?</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.580" end="01:01:57.000" style="s2">You should prepare to do a lot of things.</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.000" end="01:01:58.140" style="s2">Okay, then what?</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.140" end="01:01:59.140" style="s2">Then you should explore.</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.140" end="01:02:04.380" style="s2">Well that’s where the other half of the<br />hypothalamus comes in; that dopamanergic circuit</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.380" end="01:02:06.710" style="s2">that mediates positive emotion, right?</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.710" end="01:02:10.860" style="s2">Almost all the positive emotion that you experience<br />in your life, the kind you like, which is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.860" end="01:02:19.450" style="s2">hope and curiosity and expectation and surprise<br />and that’s all mediated by the dopamanergic</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.450" end="01:02:20.450" style="s2">systems.</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.450" end="01:02:25.950" style="s2">It’s a major-league contributor to the totality<br />of your being, especially in a positive direction.</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.950" end="01:02:31.710" style="s2">That’s rooted in the hypothalamus, so what<br />that means is that, it’s quite cool, you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.710" end="01:02:36.520" style="s2">got your fundamental motivations, you know<br />your basic biological motivations, “bang!”</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.520" end="01:02:41.320" style="s2">they fail, that’s anxiety, that’s a newer<br />system, and exploration.</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.320" end="01:02:43.450" style="s2">That’s an older system.</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.450" end="01:02:47.140" style="s2">That damn exploratory system has been there<br />forever.</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.140" end="01:02:52.950" style="s2">Now if you look at classic hero mythology,<br />which we’re going to do in great detail,</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.950" end="01:03:00.270" style="s2">what you see is that the typical myth of humanity<br />is we live in a place, we’ll say.</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.270" end="01:03:09.860" style="s2">We have to live in a place, and the place<br />is doing quite nicely, thank you very much.</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.860" end="01:03:12.490" style="s2">The Hobbits and Frodo.</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.490" end="01:03:15.970" style="s2">So you’ve got the little shire there, right?</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.970" end="01:03:19.750" style="s2">It’s all peaceful, it’s full of these<br />little people who are a little on the arrogant</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.750" end="01:03:23.260" style="s2">side, they’re kind of dopey, they have no<br />idea what the hell’s going on in the outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.260" end="01:03:28.750" style="s2">world, but they think that’s okay, they<br />think you know, peculiar people are concerned</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.750" end="01:03:29.860" style="s2">about that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.860" end="01:03:34.410" style="s2">They’ve got their little happy paradise<br />going, they live a long time, they eat a lot,</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.410" end="01:03:37.290" style="s2">they party a lot.</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.290" end="01:03:41.570" style="s2">Unbeknownst to them, which is a very interesting<br />feature of the story, the only reason they</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.570" end="01:03:47.480" style="s2">have any peace at all is because they’re<br />descendants of old kings, continually patrolling</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.480" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">the borders, right?</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:50.890" style="s2">Those are the striders.</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.890" end="01:03:56.740" style="s2">Aragorn, he’s the member of the race of<br />old kings who patrols the borders.</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.740" end="01:04:00.840" style="s2">Those are ancestral figures, it’s like you<br />can all sit here in your little happy paradise,</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.840" end="01:04:06.660" style="s2">but the only reason you can do it is because<br />the sons of great kings have put borders around</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.660" end="01:04:08.030" style="s2">your kingdom.</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.030" end="01:04:14.080" style="s2">It’s funny because in the Hobbit, the Hobbit’s<br />basically despise the Strider, they’re very,</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.080" end="01:04:15.560" style="s2">very suspicious of him.</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.560" end="01:04:19.550" style="s2">He’s kind of dirty and dusty and he looks<br />like he’s been banged around all over the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.550" end="01:04:20.550" style="s2">world.</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.550" end="01:04:21.550" style="s2">He’s sort of like a tramp.</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.550" end="01:04:25.430" style="s2">They don’t know he’s the son of a great<br />king, good thing for them that he is, however.</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.430" end="01:04:29.250" style="s2">Okay, so then you’ve got the little shire,<br />what happens?</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.250" end="01:04:31.300" style="s2">Evil things are stirring.</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.300" end="01:04:32.340" style="s2">What is it?</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.340" end="01:04:34.570" style="s2">Well, fundamentally it’s a great dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.570" end="01:04:38.660" style="s2">Well that’s a snake, except it’s like<br />a meta-snake.</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.660" end="01:04:41.010" style="s2">It’s snake with fire.</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.010" end="01:04:45.150" style="s2">You can be sure that fire was not only one<br />of our greatest allies, but one of our greatest</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.150" end="01:04:48.380" style="s2">enemies, especially when we lived on the blank<br />in Africa.</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.380" end="01:04:50.660" style="s2">That thing would burn now and then.</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.660" end="01:04:54.510" style="s2">So, get the hell away from that.</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.510" end="01:05:02.140" style="s2">So anyways, one hobbit, who’s woken up by<br />a wizard – the wizard is the symbol for</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.140" end="01:05:03.820" style="s2">the self from the Jungian perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.820" end="01:05:07.920" style="s2">So there’s one hobbit who’s a little bit<br />more creative and exploratory than the rest</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.920" end="01:05:11.460" style="s2">and everybody has a little respect for him<br />but they think he’s pretty damn peculiar.</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.460" end="01:05:15.050" style="s2">He decides that he’s going to, under the<br />tutelage of the wizard, he’s going to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.050" end="01:05:16.770" style="s2">check out this dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.770" end="01:05:20.830" style="s2">So he leaves the borders and goes out into<br />the unknown.</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.830" end="01:05:24.531" style="s2">Then the rest of it is an adventure and one<br />of things that’s very interesting, again</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.531" end="01:05:29.250" style="s2">from a Jungian perspective, is that, what<br />does the Hobbit have to become in order to</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.250" end="01:05:30.730" style="s2">conquer the dragon?</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.730" end="01:05:32.610" style="s2">A thief.</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.610" end="01:05:37.250" style="s2">Now that’s pretty weird, because you think<br />hey man, this guy’s out being a hero, so</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.250" end="01:05:38.630" style="s2">he should be a hero.</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.630" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">No, he turns into a thief.</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:42.760" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.760" end="01:05:47.820" style="s2">Well it’s because if you’re going to conquer<br />a dragon you better be a hell of a lot tougher</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.820" end="01:05:49.590" style="s2">than you are naive.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.590" end="01:05:54.400" style="s2">So, partly what happens is, for the hobbit<br />to masker up the forces that are necessary</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.400" end="01:06:05.290" style="s2">for him to confront something that is that<br />fundamental, he has to transcend the cowardess</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.290" end="01:06:07.340" style="s2">that he describes as morality.</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.340" end="01:06:13.510" style="s2">Okay, so Nietzsche for example, Nietzsche’s<br />often viewed as a critic of morality.</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.510" end="01:06:16.869" style="s2">That’s not true.</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.869" end="01:06:20.553" style="s2">Nietzsche identifies morality with cowardess,<br />but that’s not what he does.</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.553" end="01:06:27.869" style="s2">What Nietzsche says is this: if you’re too<br />afraid to do something, so you won’t do</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.869" end="01:06:33.020" style="s2">it, then you’ll say that the reason you<br />don’t do it is because you’re moral.</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.020" end="01:06:34.290" style="s2">That’s not the reason.</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.290" end="01:06:36.590" style="s2">The reason is that you’re too damn afraid<br />to do it.</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.590" end="01:06:39.380" style="s2">You might want to, but you’re too afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.380" end="01:06:41.380" style="s2">That doesn’t make you moral.</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.380" end="01:06:45.340" style="s2">So what happens to the Hobbit, for example,<br />once he gets outside of the kingdom, he has</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.340" end="01:06:51.840" style="s2">to develop a whole array of potentials that<br />he never developed before, because they were</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.840" end="01:06:58.940" style="s2">either not necessary in his civilized place,<br />or because they were forbidden as immoral</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.940" end="01:07:03.220" style="s2">by the cultural situation that he grew up<br />in.</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.220" end="01:07:08.850" style="s2">You have to be touched by the snake in order<br />to defeat the snake.</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.850" end="01:07:11.990" style="s2">Where else have you seen that motif?</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.990" end="01:07:13.200" style="s2">Harry Potter, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.200" end="01:07:17.990" style="s2">Harry Potter’s a strange character because<br />he’s not obedient, not at all.</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.990" end="01:07:20.160" style="s2">In fact, he’s quite disobedient.</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.160" end="01:07:24.020" style="s2">He breaks the rules in the service of higher<br />morality.</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.020" end="01:07:29.130" style="s2">The higher morality is that he faces down<br />the dragon that paralyzes you, and he frees</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.130" end="01:07:30.130" style="s2">the virgin.</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:34.780" style="s2">That’s what happens with Ginny – Virginia,<br />Virgin, it’s the retelling of Saint George</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.780" end="01:07:35.780" style="s2">and the dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.780" end="01:07:42.790" style="s2">And interesting enough, the reason that Harry<br />Potter revivifies, is because Dumbledore’s</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.790" end="01:07:45.850" style="s2">phoenix comes by and cries in his wounds.</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.850" end="01:07:50.710" style="s2">Well the phoenix is something that dies and<br />is reborn and so the meta-myth underlying</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.710" end="01:07:55.710" style="s2">the second-volume of the harry potter series<br />is that the part of you sustains you through</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.710" end="01:08:01.450" style="s2">an encounter with a dragon that paralyzes,<br />is the part of you that can die and be reborn.</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.450" end="01:08:06.011" style="s2">What that means in a sense is if you’re<br />wrong about something, and you fall into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.011" end="01:08:11.300" style="s2">pit, then you should let go of what you’re<br />wrong about, so that something new can arise.</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.300" end="01:08:17.980" style="s2">So it’s better to be the thing that transforms<br />in response to catastrophe, than it is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.980" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">thing that’s static.</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:22.949" style="s2">That’s another big discovery of people.</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.949" end="01:08:29.040" style="s2">We’re agents of transformation, which is<br />of course why kids are so bloody obsessed</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.040" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">with magicians and wizards, which are agents<br />of transformation.</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:36.270" style="s2">That’s all embedded in the mythology, it’s<br />all acted out.</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.270" end="01:08:39.140" style="s2">Nobody understands this sort of thing to speak<br />of.</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.140" end="01:08:41.920" style="s2">Certainly the kids don’t, it just hits them.</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.920" end="01:08:43.580" style="s2">They can recognize the pattern.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.580" end="01:08:46.920" style="s2">They know that there’s something magical<br />about them, even though they’re living in</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.920" end="01:08:52.660" style="s2">a cupboard in a London suburb, where everything<br />is boring and flat and under control.</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.660" end="01:09:00.920" style="s2">That’s not the real world, and it’s true,<br />it’s not.</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.920" end="01:09:09.858" style="s2">Is that why we have more patience for people,<br />including criminals, who admit their crime</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.858" end="01:09:10.858" style="s2">and do their punishment and redeem themselves?</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.858" end="01:09:12.680" style="s2">Oh not only patience, we often have admiration<br />for them.</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.680" end="01:09:17.950" style="s2">Oh yeah, how many movies feature attractive<br />bad guy?</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.950" end="01:09:22.450" style="s2">Well or for that matter, attractive bad woman?</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.450" end="01:09:26.140" style="s2">It’s because of the Nietzchian observation.</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.140" end="01:09:30.130" style="s2">The people who are good aren’t good, they’re<br />just cowards.</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.130" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">Whereas the guy who’s bad, well at least<br />he’s not a coward.</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:38.180" style="s2">Well then you might say, well you know, yeah<br />he could stop being a coward and also become</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.180" end="01:09:44.260" style="s2">a good guy, but that’s often but not always<br />the actual plot of the movie.</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.260" end="01:09:46.859" style="s2">That’s the redemption of the bad guy.</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.859" end="01:09:51.670" style="s2">It’s also what woman fantasize about in<br />relationship to the beauty and the beast mythology.</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.670" end="01:09:53.290" style="s2">They don’t want a coward.</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.290" end="01:09:55.350" style="s2">He’s the guy that wants to be the friend.</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.350" end="01:09:57.560" style="s2">It’s complete bullshit.</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.560" end="01:10:01.430" style="s2">The bad guys going to advance over that – but<br />not a big enough advance because he’s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.430" end="01:10:02.430" style="s2">bad guy.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.430" end="01:10:05.400" style="s2">The best thing you want is a civilized bad<br />guy.</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.400" end="01:10:06.570" style="s2">That’s what you want.</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.570" end="01:10:10.830" style="s2">Well no wonder, because it’s only a civilized<br />bad guy that’s going to be capable to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.830" end="01:10:12.380" style="s2">dealing with the dragons.</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.380" end="01:10:13.850" style="s2">It’s right.</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.850" end="01:10:18.880" style="s2">Lloyd Axworthy, when he was the minister of<br />Foreign Affairs for Canada, we know the massacres</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.880" end="01:10:20.330" style="s2">were going on in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.330" end="01:10:25.190" style="s2">It was front-page news at one point.</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.190" end="01:10:28.350" style="s2">He said, “I don’t have the imagination<br />for that kind of evil.”</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.350" end="01:10:33.210" style="s2">Oh well, that’s really impressive mister<br />minister of foreign affairs, did you ever</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.210" end="01:10:34.270" style="s2">read about the Holocaust?</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.270" end="01:10:36.770" style="s2">It’s like, it’s time to wake up a little<br />bit!</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.770" end="01:10:39.810" style="s2">These things happen, but he said it as a moral<br />claim.</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.810" end="01:10:42.440" style="s2">I just couldn’t imagine that sort of thing<br />happening.</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.440" end="01:10:45.270" style="s2">Well, you’re a little on the naïve said,<br />aren’t you?</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.270" end="01:10:50.250" style="s2">And parading that around as morality is not<br />a reasonable thing to do when you also happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.250" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">to be Minister of Foreign affairs.</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:54.790" style="s2">You should be looking out for the snakes all<br />of the time.</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.790" end="01:10:59.870" style="s2">They’re definitely out there, and Milosevic<br />was definitely one of them.</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.870" end="01:11:05.900" style="s2">So if a naive person meets someone like that,<br />the naive person loses.</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.900" end="01:11:09.780" style="s2">That’s not good because there’s lots of<br />people like that and it would be better if</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.780" end="01:11:11.320" style="s2">they didn’t win.</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.320" end="01:11:19.550" style="s2">So anyways, the fact that the exploratory<br />circuitry is embedded into the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.550" end="01:11:25.110" style="s2">way down there with lust and thirst and hunger,<br />it’s so great because it shows you how the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.110" end="01:11:26.350" style="s2">mythology works.</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.350" end="01:11:30.640" style="s2">It basically says, okay, here’s a bunch<br />of things you’re doing now and then they’ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.640" end="01:11:31.640" style="s2">go wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.640" end="01:11:34.330" style="s2">You need a system to deal with things when<br />they go wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.330" end="01:11:35.330" style="s2">What’s the system?</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.330" end="01:11:37.050" style="s2">Well it might kill you, bang!</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.050" end="01:11:40.450" style="s2">You better have some pain and anxiety to protect<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.450" end="01:11:41.850" style="s2">You better figure out what it is.</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.850" end="01:11:45.330" style="s2">Okay, better have an exploratory system so<br />that you can go out there and gather some</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.330" end="01:11:46.560" style="s2">more information.</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.560" end="01:11:52.560" style="s2">Well that’s the human story: gather information<br />in the face of danger.</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.560" end="01:11:54.050" style="s2">That’s the human story.</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.050" end="01:11:56.730" style="s2">That’s what we do.</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.730" end="01:11:58.060" style="s2">So that’s the hero myth.</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.060" end="01:12:01.880" style="s2">The hero myth is redemptive, and that’s<br />because it is redemptive.</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.880" end="01:12:05.730" style="s2">That is what works, or at least what we’ve<br />stated our being on.</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.730" end="01:12:06.730" style="s2">Who knows?</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.730" end="01:12:09.310" style="s2">Maybe all of this exploration will just get<br />us in trouble.</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.310" end="01:12:11.790" style="s2">That’s another part of genesis, right?</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.790" end="01:12:13.850" style="s2">Poke around and see what happens.</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.850" end="01:12:15.590" style="s2">Well you know you’re doing that all of the<br />time.</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.590" end="01:12:19.940" style="s2">You‘re in your little paradise, beedling<br />away all happily, and then you just can’t</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.940" end="01:12:22.730" style="s2">stop yourself from pulling on a thread somewhere.</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.730" end="01:12:26.840" style="s2">Then you find out, oh my God, then maybe that’s<br />when you get suspicious about your partner</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.840" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">cheating on you.</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:31.330" style="s2">You think, maybe this person’s cheating<br />on me, and you can’t leave it alone.</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.330" end="01:12:34.670" style="s2">You can’t leave it alone, you got to go<br />look at the snake.</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.670" end="01:12:36.190" style="s2">Turns out it’s there!</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.190" end="01:12:38.600" style="s2">Down you go into the underworld.</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.600" end="01:12:45.690" style="s2">You might think, maybe the bliss of ignorance<br />would have been better.</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.690" end="01:12:49.120" style="s2">Well, it’s not like psychologist don’t<br />tell you that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.120" end="01:12:52.360" style="s2">All those positive illusion people, that’s<br />there whole shtick.</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.360" end="01:12:56.330" style="s2">It’s better to be a little bit dumb about<br />how things work, because otherwise there’s</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.330" end="01:12:57.890" style="s2">no way you can be happy.</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.890" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">That’s an idiotic theory on two accounts.</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:06.400" style="s2">A, happy isn’t the point, and B, dumb is<br />not the goal.</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.400" end="01:13:11.750" style="s2">So it’s so ignorant that it’s actually<br />corrupt.</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.750" end="01:13:14.940" style="s2">Which is really saying something, because<br />you have to be pretty damn ignorant before</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.940" end="01:13:16.510" style="s2">you get to corrupt.</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.510" end="01:13:19.730" style="s2">So it’s a hell of a thing to teach people.</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.730" end="01:13:23.910" style="s2">You have to delude yourself in a minor way<br />otherwise you can’t stand being alive.</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.910" end="01:13:28.380" style="s2">Oh my God, that’s awful, that’s really<br />awful.</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.380" end="01:13:32.130" style="s2">Here’s a different story, maybe you’re<br />tough enough to open your eyes.</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.130" end="01:13:34.290" style="s2">That’d be a much better story.</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.290" end="01:13:37.920" style="s2">It’s possible too because people are really,<br />really, really tough.</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.920" end="01:13:42.360" style="s2">It’s just that they live in these little<br />protected places and they never get out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.360" end="01:13:47.390" style="s2">and hammer themselves out against the world,<br />so they never discover that they’re tough.</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.390" end="01:13:48.620" style="s2">You might thing, well that’s your opinion.</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.620" end="01:13:50.960" style="s2">Well no, it’s not my damn opinion.</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.960" end="01:13:56.260" style="s2">We know that if you take someone who’s naïve<br />and paralyzed by anxiety, and you put them</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.260" end="01:14:00.570" style="s2">in psychotherapy and you expose them to the<br />things that they’re afraid of and disgusted</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.570" end="01:14:06.390" style="s2">by and avoiding, that it isn’t that they<br />get less afraid, they get more confident.</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.390" end="01:14:08.870" style="s2">That’s what generalizes.</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.870" end="01:14:12.150" style="s2">If you bring someone in who’s got a mouse<br />phobia and you treat the mouse phobia, then</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.150" end="01:14:14.370" style="s2">they’re not as afraid of a bunch of other<br />things.</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.370" end="01:14:15.550" style="s2">Why does that happen?</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.550" end="01:14:20.530" style="s2">They weren’t afraid of the damn mouse, they’re<br />afraid of their own inadequacy.</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.530" end="01:14:23.260" style="s2">Then you teach them that they don’t have<br />to be afraid, and then they think , “hey,</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.260" end="01:14:25.360" style="s2">I don’t have to be afraid.”</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:27.989" style="s2">Then they’re not afraid of a whole bunch<br />of things.</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.989" end="01:14:31.640" style="s2">So you get generalization from behavioral<br />exposure.</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.640" end="01:14:37.260" style="s2">There’s no question about whether or not<br />exposure to the things that you avoid is curative,</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.260" end="01:14:39.510" style="s2">it’s the fundamental axiom of psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.510" end="01:14:43.380" style="s2">That and figuring out what you’re going<br />to do with your future.</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.380" end="01:14:46.260" style="s2">Even in psychoanalysis it’s face what threatens<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.260" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">It’s just that the psychoanalysts go after<br />past traumas.</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:52.010" style="s2">It doesn’t matter as far as your brain is<br />concerned.</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.010" end="01:14:58.060" style="s2">A dangerous thing in the past is exactly the<br />same thing as a dangerous thing in the present.</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.060" end="01:15:03.070" style="s2">It seems to be partly because the amygdala<br />doesn’t have any sense of time.</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.070" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">it’s interesting because one of the things<br />Jung observed was that there’s no time in</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:08.110" style="s2">the collective unconscious.</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.110" end="01:15:11.090" style="s2">It’s like everything is an eternal now.</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.090" end="01:15:16.900" style="s2">So let’s say you got traumatized when you<br />were a kid, your amygdala grows; maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.900" end="01:15:18.540" style="s2">got bitten by a spider.</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.540" end="01:15:22.770" style="s2">You’re afraid of that spider then and now<br />and in the future.</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.770" end="01:15:24.090" style="s2">It’s the same.</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.090" end="01:15:26.420" style="s2">It’s outside of time.</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.420" end="01:15:29.390" style="s2">The hippocampus is the thing that’s dealing<br />with time.</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.390" end="01:15:34.570" style="s2">So, you know, if you really learn a lesson<br />it’s supposed to be timeless.</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.570" end="01:15:38.790" style="s2">You can still help people overcome their phobias,<br />but you can’t get their damn amygdala to</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.790" end="01:15:39.920" style="s2">shrink again.</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.920" end="01:15:43.270" style="s2">So, you can just get it back under control.</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.270" end="01:15:46.790" style="s2">Okay, so that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.790" end="01:15:50.770" style="s2">Then, we could say, let’s go up a level<br />or two.</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.770" end="01:15:56.660" style="s2">Well, let’s look at the amygdala for a minute.</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.660" end="01:16:00.200" style="s2">Things about the amygdala have probably changed<br />since I updated my knowledge, but it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.200" end="01:16:04.110" style="s2">really matter because the fundamental systems<br />I’m telling you about exist.</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.110" end="01:16:13.550" style="s2">They keep moving around in the brain because<br />we don’t know exactly how they work, but</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.550" end="01:16:18.900" style="s2">at a system level of description and using<br />slightly vague neuropsychology, we can localize</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.900" end="01:16:20.570" style="s2">these sorts of things in the brain.</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.570" end="01:16:24.430" style="s2">Okay so the amygdala gets inputs from everywhere.</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.430" end="01:16:30.220" style="s2">Basically what it’s looking for are things<br />that might threaten you.</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.220" end="01:16:37.670" style="s2">You could say in a sense that the amygdala<br />has an inbuilt sense of the monstress.</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.670" end="01:16:42.630" style="s2">Let me show you, this is a good time to show<br />you a comic.</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.630" end="01:16:44.770" style="s2">This is a great comic.</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.770" end="01:16:47.360" style="s2">Someone stoned came up with this comic.</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.360" end="01:16:51.050" style="s2">They really did.</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.050" end="01:16:56.590" style="s2">I really like this comic because it shows<br />you what’s going on perfectly.</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.590" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">Okay, so there are these hippies.</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">They’re all friends of this guy named Fat<br />Freddie.</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:04.430" style="s2">They’re basically useless hippies.</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.430" end="01:17:09.240" style="s2">They don’t pay rent and all they do is smoke<br />pot.</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.240" end="01:17:13.820" style="s2">Anyways, at one point they make a bunch of<br />money on some cocaine deal and they buy this</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.820" end="01:17:16.210" style="s2">home out in the country.</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.210" end="01:17:18.860" style="s2">They think they’re going to go out there<br />and live in paradise, so they bring their</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.860" end="01:17:23.700" style="s2">cat along, which is Fat Freddie’s cat who<br />has his own adventures with cockroaches and</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.700" end="01:17:24.920" style="s2">so on.</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.920" end="01:17:29.020" style="s2">Anyways, if you’ve ever had a cat one thing<br />you know about cats is they don’t like to</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.020" end="01:17:30.020" style="s2">move.</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.020" end="01:17:33.020" style="s2">It makes them very upset and nervous, and<br />if you put them in a new house they’re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.020" end="01:17:34.210" style="s2">happy about it.</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.210" end="01:17:37.230" style="s2">The reason for that is you’ve blown their<br />map, right?</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.230" end="01:17:42.810" style="s2">The cat will slink around in a new territory<br />and map every single place and every hiding</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.810" end="01:17:47.880" style="s2">place, obsessively, until it knows what the<br />hell’s going on, and then it will finally</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.880" end="01:17:48.880" style="s2">relax.</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.880" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2">A cat in a new place is not a calm cat.</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:56.460" style="s2">A cat in a new place is a nervous cat, which<br />is also an indication that you don’t have</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.460" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">to learn to be afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:00.910" style="s2">What you have to learn is how to be calm.</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.910" end="01:18:05.300" style="s2">That reverse the way that psychologists generally<br />talk about anxiety, because they’re all</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.300" end="01:18:08.090" style="s2">hobbits and they think that life is safe.</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.090" end="01:18:11.770" style="s2">So because they think that life is safe, you<br />have to learn to be afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.770" end="01:18:13.220" style="s2">That’s dopey.</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.220" end="01:18:16.631" style="s2">The natural condition is terror and curiosity.</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.631" end="01:18:20.350" style="s2">If you’re really lucky now and then, you’re<br />somewhere safe enough so that you don’t</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.350" end="01:18:21.930" style="s2">have to be afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.930" end="01:18:24.730" style="s2">That’s tenuous and delicate.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.730" end="01:18:27.170" style="s2">So what you have to learn is how not to be<br />afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.170" end="01:18:29.090" style="s2">Not, how to be afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.090" end="01:18:31.820" style="s2">Anyways, they got the cat.</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.820" end="01:18:36.260" style="s2">So he’s in his box and they take him out<br />of the box and the cat thinks, “so this</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.260" end="01:18:37.260" style="s2">is the country.”</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.260" end="01:18:42.520" style="s2">So the cat goes really low and starts sniffing,<br />and that is what animals do when they first</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.520" end="01:18:43.590" style="s2">start exploring.</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.590" end="01:18:48.750" style="s2">Both of those things: they crouch down because<br />that makes them less visible to predators,</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.750" end="01:18:49.750" style="s2">and they sniff.</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.750" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">The reason they sniff is because most animals<br />have their whole brains built around their</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:00.670" style="s2">sense of smell; unlike us, where most of our<br />brain is built around vision.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.670" end="01:19:05.780" style="s2">Anyways, the cat’s slinking around there<br />and it smells something that it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.780" end="01:19:06.780" style="s2">know.</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.780" end="01:19:11.050" style="s2">It thinks, God only knows what this thing<br />that I don’t know is.</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.050" end="01:19:14.700" style="s2">It would freeze first and then it would hastily<br />retreat.</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.700" end="01:19:16.920" style="s2">So now it’s underneath the porch.</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.920" end="01:19:19.350" style="s2">One hippie says, “where’d the cat disappear<br />now?”</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.350" end="01:19:21.130" style="s2">The other one says, “under the house.”</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.130" end="01:19:26.000" style="s2">The cat’s down there shaking, which is what<br />cats do when they’re freaked out like that,</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.000" end="01:19:28.360" style="s2">and it’s got it’s little fantasy going.</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.360" end="01:19:30.520" style="s2">You’d hide to if you smelled what I did.</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.520" end="01:19:32.370" style="s2">Then it imagines up this monster.</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.370" end="01:19:36.900" style="s2">A monster technically is the amalgamation<br />of unrelated parts.</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.900" end="01:19:38.420" style="s2">So what’s the monster?</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.420" end="01:19:44.840" style="s2">Well its got duck feet and bare arms and its<br />got a skunk tail and its got kind of a wolf</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.840" end="01:19:46.060" style="s2">head, and its got antlers.</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.060" end="01:19:49.160" style="s2">You think, well that thing doesn’t exist.</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.160" end="01:19:50.430" style="s2">That’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.430" end="01:19:51.430" style="s2">That thing exists.</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.430" end="01:19:56.710" style="s2">In fact it’s a really accurate representation<br />of what’s out there in the forest.</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.710" end="01:20:01.840" style="s2">Any one animal wouldn’t look like that,<br />but the set of all possible animals looks</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.840" end="01:20:03.050" style="s2">exactly like that.</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.050" end="01:20:08.420" style="s2">Then you might think, well what do you want<br />first, when you’re analyzing something?</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.420" end="01:20:12.220" style="s2">Do you want quick and dirty representation<br />of what to be afraid of?</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.220" end="01:20:15.860" style="s2">Or do you want to hang around trying to figure<br />out whether that thing has hooves and teeth?</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.860" end="01:20:21.190" style="s2">It’s like no, you want a quick and dirty<br />representation of just what might be lurking</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.190" end="01:20:22.430" style="s2">out there.</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.430" end="01:20:24.530" style="s2">That’s intelligent hypothesizing.</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.530" end="01:20:28.030" style="s2">It’s the kind of hypothesizing that would<br />be evolutionary driven.</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.030" end="01:20:33.340" style="s2">Did you ever see the far side cartoon, Monster<br />Snorkel?</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.340" end="01:20:35.390" style="s2">I love that cartoon.</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.390" end="01:20:40.770" style="s2">There’s this little kid in his bed, it’s<br />dark and he’s under cover.</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.770" end="01:20:44.350" style="s2">He’s one of those ugly little kids that<br />Gary Larson always drew.</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.350" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">He’s got this snorkel that you use for scuba<br />diving.</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:54.450" style="s2">Snorkeling, not scuba diving.</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.450" end="01:20:59.360" style="s2">All that’s sticking out from under the covers<br />is his snorkel so that he can breathe.</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.360" end="01:21:05.940" style="s2">Of course in his imagination there’s some<br />reptilian dinosaur sitting beside his bed.</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.940" end="01:21:07.210" style="s2">Well, why?</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.210" end="01:21:09.750" style="s2">That’s what he’s hypothesizing.</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.750" end="01:21:10.750" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.750" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">Because that’s what’s in the dark.</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:17.800" style="s2">You can tell your kid, there’s no monsters<br />in the dark.</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.800" end="01:21:19.989" style="s2">Then you tell your kid to never talk to a<br />stranger.</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.989" end="01:21:21.870" style="s2">Well get your story straight people.</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.870" end="01:21:22.870" style="s2">Really?</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.870" end="01:21:24.210" style="s2">It’s so dopey.</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.210" end="01:21:27.260" style="s2">Yes there are monsters in the dark.</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.260" end="01:21:28.260" style="s2">What do you tell your kids?</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.260" end="01:21:30.040" style="s2">No, there’s no such thing as monsters.</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.040" end="01:21:35.210" style="s2">First of all they’re driven half crazy because<br />they think what am I afraid of then?</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.210" end="01:21:39.380" style="s2">Second, you tell them all of the time that<br />there are monsters in the dark.</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.380" end="01:21:43.870" style="s2">In fact you’re probably more paranoid about<br />the things than your damn kid is.</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.870" end="01:21:45.060" style="s2">So what do you tell them?</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.060" end="01:21:49.330" style="s2">There are monsters in the dark but you can<br />probably handle them, especially with our</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.330" end="01:21:50.330" style="s2">help.</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.330" end="01:21:52.750" style="s2">Okay, so now I’ll tell you a story.</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.750" end="01:22:00.670" style="s2">So my nephew, he was six, and he had night<br />terrors.</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.670" end="01:22:04.780" style="s2">Night terrors are this strange phenomena where<br />all of a sudden you wake up screaming.</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.780" end="01:22:07.500" style="s2">It’s quite unpleasant.</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.500" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">You might say, well why is this happening?</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.600" end="01:22:13.770" style="s2">The answer is that we really don’t know<br />but there was some instability in his household</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.770" end="01:22:14.770" style="s2">at that point.</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.770" end="01:22:18.370" style="s2">A, he was just going off to kindergarten,<br />so that’s a big transition.</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.370" end="01:22:21.130" style="s2">It’s out of paradise and out into the world.</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.130" end="01:22:27.250" style="s2">B, his parents were in the throws of approaching<br />divorce, so there was that sort of undercurrent</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.250" end="01:22:28.250" style="s2">in the house.</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.250" end="01:22:29.610" style="s2">You know what that’s like.</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.610" end="01:22:32.710" style="s2">You walk into a house like that and you know<br />something’s up.</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.710" end="01:22:34.440" style="s2">It’s like the air is frozen.</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.440" end="01:22:37.800" style="s2">It’s probably something you can smell, I<br />think.</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.800" end="01:22:41.510" style="s2">Whatever, it doesn’t matter, but you can<br />certainly tell.</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.510" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">So anyways, he’s waking up at night screaming<br />away.</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:47.210" style="s2">He’s a very verbal kid.</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.210" end="01:22:51.300" style="s2">During the day he’s running around, I guess<br />he was about four, not six.</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.300" end="01:22:53.530" style="s2">He’s got this little night hat that he wears.</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.530" end="01:22:54.650" style="s2">It’s a plastic night hat.</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.650" end="01:22:58.820" style="s2">So he zooms around with that all of the time,<br />and he’s got this plastic sword, and he</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.820" end="01:22:59.820" style="s2">zooms around with that too.</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.820" end="01:23:02.090" style="s2">So you think what’s he up to?</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.090" end="01:23:06.541" style="s2">He’s playing knight, which is kind of weird<br />in a way.</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.541" end="01:23:11.020" style="s2">Because you’d think why would being a knight<br />be attractive to a kid?</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.020" end="01:23:12.710" style="s2">We weren’t knights for that long.</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.710" end="01:23:14.160" style="s2">Whatever, it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.160" end="01:23:17.060" style="s2">He was running around playing knight.</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.060" end="01:23:21.400" style="s2">He goes to sleep and he puts his knight hat<br />and is sword right beside his bed.</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.400" end="01:23:23.410" style="s2">So fine, I watch that.</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.410" end="01:23:26.430" style="s2">I’m watching what’s going on with them<br />and I’m figuring out what’s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.430" end="01:23:27.430" style="s2">the house.</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.430" end="01:23:29.810" style="s2">His mom is worried because he’s having night<br />terrors.</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.810" end="01:23:32.450" style="s2">Yeah, it’s horrible he wakes up screaming.</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.450" end="01:23:34.440" style="s2">So okay, nighttime comes.</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.440" end="01:23:38.920" style="s2">He wakes up screaming, we’re all sitting<br />at the breakfast table the next day.</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.920" end="01:23:42.270" style="s2">I said, did you dream about anything?</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.270" end="01:23:43.340" style="s2">He said, yeah!</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.340" end="01:23:50.570" style="s2">He got right into this dream and he said okay,<br />this is what happened: I was out in a field</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.570" end="01:23:53.650" style="s2">and all of these little dwarfs were around<br />me.</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.650" end="01:23:57.310" style="s2">They only came up to my knees but they had<br />big beaks, they didn’t have any arms, but</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.310" end="01:23:59.400" style="s2">they had big beaks.</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.400" end="01:24:02.120" style="s2">They were covered with hair and grease, so<br />they were all greased down.</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.120" end="01:24:06.550" style="s2">There was a cross-shave at the top of their<br />head, and wherever I went these beaked dwarfs</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.550" end="01:24:10.680" style="s2">would jump at me with their feet and bite<br />me.</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.680" end="01:24:13.400" style="s2">They’re everywhere!</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.400" end="01:24:17.260" style="s2">Everyone stops eating breakfast to look at<br />this kid, thinking, wow no wonder why you’re</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.260" end="01:24:19.380" style="s2">screaming man.</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.380" end="01:24:25.010" style="s2">Then he said, yeah, and it was worse than<br />that because there was smoke and at the back</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.010" end="01:24:29.340" style="s2">of the dwarfs there was this dragon and the<br />dragon was breathing out smoke and fire and</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.340" end="01:24:31.150" style="s2">the smoke and fire would turn into the dwarfs.</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.150" end="01:24:33.830" style="s2">Oh my God, what do you do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.830" end="01:24:37.910" style="s2">Wiping out some dwarfs, who cares, but the<br />dragon will just breathe up some more.</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.910" end="01:24:39.900" style="s2">That’s life man.</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.900" end="01:24:46.510" style="s2">I’ve got this excellent picture, let me<br />show it to you because it’s worth finding,</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.510" end="01:25:14.010" style="s2">even though it’s going to interrupt my story<br />a little bit.</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.010" end="01:25:16.390" style="s2">Well I’m not going to find it because it<br />will take too long, but I’ll tell you what</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.390" end="01:25:17.390" style="s2">it is.</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.390" end="01:25:19.670" style="s2">It’s a Greek amphora.</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.670" end="01:25:25.350" style="s2">You know amphora, it’s like a vase, and<br />people used to keep wine in them.</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.350" end="01:25:29.810" style="s2">It’s painted on like a cartoon, it’s sort<br />of black and white.</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.810" end="01:25:33.630" style="s2">It’s got this hero, who I believe is Hercules.</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.630" end="01:25:37.080" style="s2">Hercules is facing this snake, and it’s<br />a really cool snake.</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.080" end="01:25:40.810" style="s2">So first of all it’s tail is curled in a<br />perfect circle.</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.810" end="01:25:47.930" style="s2">If you look at dragons and snakes in mythology,<br />their tales are often curled in a circle.</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.930" end="01:25:51.520" style="s2">It means something like infinity.</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.520" end="01:25:53.570" style="s2">Then there are all these snakes – it’s<br />a hydra.</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.570" end="01:25:56.040" style="s2">It’s a snake with eight heads.</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.040" end="01:25:59.580" style="s2">Then there’s Hercules with his sword – well,<br />what’s the problem with the hydra?</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.580" end="01:26:04.790" style="s2">You cut off one head and eight more heads<br />grow.</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.790" end="01:26:12.000" style="s2">Quit cutting off heads – it’s a good piece<br />of foreign policy advice for the middle east.</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.000" end="01:26:13.360" style="s2">The hydras keep growing.</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.360" end="01:26:16.370" style="s2">Okay, so cutting off heads isn’t going to<br />be of any utility.</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.370" end="01:26:21.210" style="s2">Here’s what the story is saying: no matter<br />how many problems you solve there’s going</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.210" end="01:26:24.670" style="s2">to be a bunch more problems and it’s even<br />worse than that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.670" end="01:26:28.489" style="s2">If you have a problem and you solve it that’s<br />going to lead to more problems.</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.489" end="01:26:30.380" style="s2">So even the solution is a problem.</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.380" end="01:26:32.980" style="s2">That’s the law of unexpected consequences.</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.980" end="01:26:36.060" style="s2">That’s why automobiles have destroyed the<br />atmosphere.</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.060" end="01:26:40.770" style="s2">Everybody thought an automobile is for getting<br />from point A to point B. It turns out it’s</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.770" end="01:26:41.770" style="s2">not.</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.770" end="01:26:45.550" style="s2">It’s for turning the world’s holes into<br />jungles.</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.550" end="01:26:47.270" style="s2">We didn’t know that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.270" end="01:26:50.270" style="s2">So that’s an unexpected consequence.</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.270" end="01:26:54.510" style="s2">So anyways, the kid is faced with this horrible<br />conundrum.</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.510" end="01:26:55.510" style="s2">What am I going to do?</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.510" end="01:26:58.610" style="s2">I’ve got these stupid dwarfs and then there’s<br />this dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.610" end="01:27:03.530" style="s2">So I said, what could you do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.530" end="01:27:07.130" style="s2">Now that’s called a loaded question and<br />it would be inadmissible in a court of law</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.130" end="01:27:14.580" style="s2">in a sense because it’s a question – but<br />it isn’t because I’m telling him something.</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.580" end="01:27:18.489" style="s2">You could do something about that.</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.489" end="01:27:19.890" style="s2">Well that’s a hell of a theory.</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.890" end="01:27:23.070" style="s2">Well yeah, I should just lay down and let<br />the dwarfs eat me.</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.070" end="01:27:25.320" style="s2">No, no you could do something about it, I<br />said.</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.320" end="01:27:26.380" style="s2">What could you do?</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.380" end="01:27:32.920" style="s2">Then he said, I’d put my hat on, I’d get<br />my sword, then I’d go get my dad and we’d</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.920" end="01:27:33.920" style="s2">go up to the dragon.</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.920" end="01:27:38.050" style="s2">I would jump on his head and then I’d poke<br />both his eyes out with my sword and then I’d</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.050" end="01:27:42.320" style="s2">go right down to his stomach to the place<br />where the fire comes out and I’d cut a piece</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.320" end="01:27:45.640" style="s2">off of that and I’d use it as a shield.</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.640" end="01:27:48.050" style="s2">And I thought, “right on, kid!</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.050" end="01:27:49.050" style="s2">You got it.”</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.050" end="01:27:51.780" style="s2">It was so cool because he had the whole thing,<br />eh.</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.780" end="01:27:53.469" style="s2">That’s why he was running around playing<br />knight.</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.469" end="01:27:59.210" style="s2">He’d almost got it, and all I had to do<br />was drop – there’s this fifth chemical</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.210" end="01:28:01.880" style="s2">phenomena called a super-saturated solution.</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.880" end="01:28:02.920" style="s2">It’s kind of cool.</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.920" end="01:28:10.270" style="s2">So if you take - water can only dissolve so<br />much sugar until the sugar starts to crystallize</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.270" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">out.</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:22.820" style="s2">If you really slowly cool down then water<br />and you don’t tap it there’s no impurities.</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.820" end="01:28:27.730" style="s2">You can get the solution super saturated which<br />means, weirdly enough, it holds more sugar</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.730" end="01:28:29.180" style="s2">than it can.</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.180" end="01:28:34.540" style="s2">It’s like it forgets to crystallize or maybe<br />it needs a little impurity or shock or something</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.540" end="01:28:37.470" style="s2">to get it going, but it’s like it forgets<br />to crystallize.</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.470" end="01:28:40.167" style="s2">So then if you take a little crystal of sugar<br />and you drop it in, it’s like it goes “sound”</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.167" end="01:28:44.040" style="s2">and instantly it’s all crystals.</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.040" end="01:28:49.300" style="s2">So that’s what happened to this kid: he<br />was there, he was ready, he had to answer,</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.300" end="01:28:55.790" style="s2">and all I had to do was say you could do something<br />about this and “poof!” instant hero myth.</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.790" end="01:29:01.870" style="s2">The cool thing is no more night terrors.</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.870" end="01:29:05.000" style="s2">So you get the picture, it’s very, very<br />cool.</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.000" end="01:29:09.600" style="s2">Alright so, back to our discussion.</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.600" end="01:29:24.460" style="s2">Now, alright so you’ve got the brain here.</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.460" end="01:29:37.740" style="s2">This is the brain as conceptualized by Alexander<br />Luria, who was Russia’s most famous neuropsychologist.</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.740" end="01:29:42.390" style="s2">So basically he said that there’s a bunch<br />of different ways you can divide up the brain.</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.390" end="01:29:46.660" style="s2">It depends on what you want, which is an interesting<br />way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.660" end="01:29:50.700" style="s2">Because you might say well how should you<br />divide up the world and the answer is it depends</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.700" end="01:29:52.239" style="s2">on what you want.</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.239" end="01:29:57.760" style="s2">It depends on some degree of the world, but<br />it depends even more on what you want.</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.760" end="01:30:02.889" style="s2">So one of the things Luria said was if you<br />go from the back to the front of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.889" end="01:30:07.550" style="s2">– the front’s the grey part here – what<br />you see is, roughly speaking, the back half</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.550" end="01:30:12.700" style="s2">of the brain does sensory processing, especially<br />visual processing, and the front half of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.700" end="01:30:14.410" style="s2">brain does motor processing.</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.410" end="01:30:18.980" style="s2">Okay, and so if you look at the back of the<br />brain the sensory unit there, you see there’s</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.980" end="01:30:21.190" style="s2">an auditory area and a visual area.</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.190" end="01:30:24.730" style="s2">What’s cool is those overlap to some degree.</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.730" end="01:30:29.750" style="s2">So there’s some hypothesis that the place<br />where the sensory systems overlap are the</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.750" end="01:30:34.930" style="s2">parts that are responsible for your experience<br />of a unified perceptual field.</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.930" end="01:30:39.320" style="s2">So here’s an example: imagine the visual<br />cortex and the auditory cortex overlap in</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.320" end="01:30:40.320" style="s2">once place.</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.320" end="01:30:45.840" style="s2">Okay, so it would sort of be here, about there<br />on the left side.</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.840" end="01:30:48.489" style="s2">That’s the part you use for silent reading.</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.489" end="01:30:50.489" style="s2">Isn’t that cool?</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.489" end="01:30:52.550" style="s2">It means your using your eyes as ears.</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.550" end="01:30:56.390" style="s2">The way you do that is you use the overlap<br />between the visual and the auditory cortex.</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.390" end="01:31:00.390" style="s2">It’s so cool, you can use your eyes as ears.</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.390" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">So the senses aren’t as separate as people<br />think.</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:07.390" style="s2">I used to wear glasses and I couldn’t hear<br />what people were saying when I wasn’t wearing</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.390" end="01:31:08.390" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.390" end="01:31:10.820" style="s2">The reason for that is I wasn’t watching<br />their lips.</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.820" end="01:31:14.680" style="s2">So a lot of what I was hearing in language<br />processing was the expression on their face</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.680" end="01:31:15.980" style="s2">and the movement of their lips.</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.980" end="01:31:18.490" style="s2">I take off my glasses, and I’m deaf.</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.490" end="01:31:21.440" style="s2">So anyways, that’s the sensory unit, half<br />of the brain.</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.440" end="01:31:24.690" style="s2">Most of it’s the visual cortex because we’re<br />visual creatures.</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.690" end="01:31:26.739" style="s2">The front half is the motor unit.</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.739" end="01:31:27.910" style="s2">Okay, why?</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.910" end="01:31:31.219" style="s2">Well because we proceed and act.</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.219" end="01:31:34.230" style="s2">So it’s the part of the brain that’s responsible<br />for zipping you around.</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.230" end="01:31:36.650" style="s2">You’ve got voluntary action, right?</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.650" end="01:31:43.180" style="s2">You inhabit a nervous system that enables<br />you to navigate your way around the world.</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.180" end="01:31:44.469" style="s2">We’re navigators, fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.469" end="01:31:48.010" style="s2">We really are navigators.</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.010" end="01:31:51.010" style="s2">You know ants can navigate by the stars?</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.010" end="01:31:52.010" style="s2">Think about that.</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.010" end="01:31:54.530" style="s2">How the hell can an ant navigate by the stars?</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.530" end="01:31:59.590" style="s2">They figured that out by watching ants figure<br />out how to get back, and then covering up</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.590" end="01:32:03.260" style="s2">the sky, and then the ants would wander around<br />not knowing where they were going.</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.260" end="01:32:07.070" style="s2">Yeah there’s lots of things we don’t understand,<br />I can tell you that.</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.070" end="01:32:08.910" style="s2">So anyways, the motor unit.</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.910" end="01:32:11.230" style="s2">You’ve got the motor strip.</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.230" end="01:32:15.810" style="s2">Now if you touch that with an electrode during<br />brain surgery then people will either move</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.810" end="01:32:20.450" style="s2">or have the impulse to move and you can map<br />out how the body is represented in the brain</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.450" end="01:32:24.460" style="s2">by touching that strip with an electrode,<br />and that was done by Wilmer Penfield at the</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.460" end="01:32:25.920" style="s2">Montreal Neurological Institute.</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.920" end="01:32:31.250" style="s2">It was a major move forward in the understanding<br />of the brain and he did that on epileptics</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.250" end="01:32:35.560" style="s2">before surgery, because he didn’t want to<br />take out parts of the brain that were necessary</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.560" end="01:32:37.730" style="s2">so he was trying to figure out what they were<br />doing.</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.730" end="01:32:42.020" style="s2">So that’s the part that enables you to act<br />voluntarily, and in front of that there’s</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.020" end="01:32:44.360" style="s2">the premotor strip.</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.360" end="01:32:47.030" style="s2">In front of that there’s the prefrontal<br />cortex.</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.030" end="01:32:53.710" style="s2">Now, what’s cool is that the premotor strip<br />and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.710" end="01:32:56.160" style="s2">motor strip over the course of evolution.</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.160" end="01:32:59.610" style="s2">So then you might say, well why do we think?</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.610" end="01:33:03.320" style="s2">The answer isn’t so that we can come up<br />with accurate, objective representations of</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.320" end="01:33:04.320" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.320" end="01:33:07.200" style="s2">The answer is, so that we can plan what to<br />do.</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.200" end="01:33:14.460" style="s2">What you see, fundamentally, is that as you<br />move forward in the brain you go from action</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.460" end="01:33:16.400" style="s2">to planning action.</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.400" end="01:33:20.230" style="s2">So by the time you get to the prefrontal cortex,<br />let’s say the dorsal-lateral prefrontal</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.230" end="01:33:24.810" style="s2">cortex, which is the part of the brain that<br />you use for abstract thinking, what you’re</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.810" end="01:33:33.780" style="s2">basically doing is conjuring up avatars of<br />yourself in an imaginary world, running them</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.780" end="01:33:38.270" style="s2">as simulations in your imagination, and the<br />collective imagination, that’s what stories</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.270" end="01:33:42.910" style="s2">are, running the simulation until the end<br />to see if you live or die.</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.910" end="01:33:45.740" style="s2">If you die then you don’t implement the<br />simulation.</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.740" end="01:33:49.270" style="s2">If you live and thrive then you do implement<br />the situation.</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.270" end="01:33:57.200" style="s2">So – who was it – Carl Popper, philosopher<br />of science said, the reason we think is so</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.200" end="01:34:00.200" style="s2">we can let our thoughts die instead of us.</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.200" end="01:34:03.290" style="s2">Right, that’s smart.</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.290" end="01:34:06.640" style="s2">That also ties into the death and rebirth<br />idea, right?</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.640" end="01:34:11.100" style="s2">Are you going to die, or are you going to<br />let your avatars die?</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.100" end="01:34:17.710" style="s2">One way of thinking about that is that your<br />current self is just an avatar.</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.710" end="01:34:21.490" style="s2">Now if you understand that, that means you<br />also understand the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.490" end="01:34:25.210" style="s2">Jungian self and the ego.</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.210" end="01:34:28.580" style="s2">The ego is an avatar, the self is the thing.</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.580" end="01:34:33.600" style="s2">Now I don’t know if you know this, but the<br />word avatar is actually a theological term.</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.600" end="01:34:36.270" style="s2">It’s from Sand script.</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.270" end="01:34:39.720" style="s2">An avatar is the form that a God takes on<br />earth.</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.720" end="01:34:43.969" style="s2">It’s pretty cool that that turned into the<br />term for the thing you use in a video game.</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.969" end="01:34:48.920" style="s2">That’s your little, disposable self.</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.920" end="01:34:52.050" style="s2">You throw it out there in the world and it<br />can live or die, and you’re back there like</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.050" end="01:34:54.880" style="s2">God just being eternal all along the way.</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.880" end="01:34:58.050" style="s2">So, that’s a very, very weird thing.</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.050" end="01:35:01.090" style="s2">Anyways, even before we had video games we<br />were doing that.</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.090" end="01:35:07.239" style="s2">We had fiction, we had stories, we had imagination,<br />and it’s decoupled from our motor systems.</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.239" end="01:35:13.780" style="s2">So we can implement these hypothetical instances<br />of ourselves before we implement them.</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.780" end="01:35:15.500" style="s2">That’s kind of how we fight Hydras.</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.500" end="01:35:18.250" style="s2">Okay, so you have eight snakes, what do you<br />do about that?</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.250" end="01:35:20.469" style="s2">You have eight potential selves.</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.469" end="01:35:25.050" style="s2">You multiply potential selves just as fast<br />as you multiply snakes.</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.050" end="01:35:28.840" style="s2">That’s what evolution does, right?</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.840" end="01:35:32.530" style="s2">Let’s say you’ve got a mongoose.</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.530" end="01:35:36.640" style="s2">Mongoose like to eat snakes, they’re really<br />good at it.</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.640" end="01:35:37.640" style="s2">They can eat cobras.</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.640" end="01:35:38.640" style="s2">Go Mongoose!</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.640" end="01:35:41.890" style="s2">So you think, well a mongoose gets killed<br />by a cobra.</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.890" end="01:35:45.570" style="s2">Well that’s not a very good mongoose but<br />that doesn’t matter because the mongoose</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.570" end="01:35:49.670" style="s2">are generating all sorts of mongoose, and<br />one of them is going to be able to kill the</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.670" end="01:35:50.670" style="s2">snake.</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.670" end="01:35:52.540" style="s2">That’s all that really matters.</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.540" end="01:35:58.190" style="s2">There’s a very funny mouse that lives in<br />the desert in Arizona.</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.190" end="01:36:01.699" style="s2">I like this mouse a lot, and it jumps.</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.699" end="01:36:04.890" style="s2">It’s so cool, this mouse, it feeds on scorpions.</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.890" end="01:36:07.680" style="s2">How the hell did it learn to do that?</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.680" end="01:36:12.400" style="s2">Anyways, it has to teach its young to eat<br />scorpions, and its quite immune from scorpion</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.400" end="01:36:14.530" style="s2">venom, which is quite helpful.</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.530" end="01:36:19.570" style="s2">Still it goes out – it’s like you going<br />out to wrestle a blank crocodile – it’s</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.570" end="01:36:22.760" style="s2">like a scorpion is a big thing compared to<br />a mouse.</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.760" end="01:36:25.730" style="s2">The mouse will hop on to the scorpion and<br />they have this terrible fight, and finally</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.730" end="01:36:27.000" style="s2">the mouse tears it a part.</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.000" end="01:36:30.739" style="s2">Then it brings it back and feeds it to its<br />mice babies.</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.739" end="01:36:33.180" style="s2">Do you know what it does then?</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.180" end="01:36:37.050" style="s2">It goes outside and howls at the moon like<br />a wolf.</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.050" end="01:36:44.630" style="s2">It sounds like a mouse so it’s really squeaky,<br />but if you slow it down, you know, which is</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.630" end="01:36:49.700" style="s2">what you have to do if you want to, for example,<br />hear mouse vocalizations, because they’re</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.700" end="01:36:54.190" style="s2">often much higher than your threshold for<br />hearing.</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.190" end="01:36:59.250" style="s2">Blank that, to hear a rat’s laugh when you<br />tickle them, you have to slow down their vocalizations</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.250" end="01:37:04.310" style="s2">because they laugh at ultrasonic frequencies,<br />so you have to slow down your vocalizations</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.310" end="01:37:06.130" style="s2">to hear them laugh when you tickle them.</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.130" end="01:37:10.830" style="s2">Anyways, these damn mice go out in the desert<br />at night, after eating a scorpion, and they</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.830" end="01:37:12.640" style="s2">howl at the moon.</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.640" end="01:37:15.660" style="s2">Go mice.</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.660" end="01:37:20.949" style="s2">So anyways, back to the brain here.</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.949" end="01:37:24.570" style="s2">There are all of these terrible monsters being<br />generated.</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.570" end="01:37:29.050" style="s2">You generate avatars of yourself to cope with<br />them, and generally used to have to evolve</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.050" end="01:37:33.930" style="s2">to do that, but human beings, being the smart<br />creatures that we are, generated up an environment</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.930" end="01:37:39.340" style="s2">in the imagination and then populated it with<br />imaginary representations of ourselves, and</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.340" end="01:37:40.880" style="s2">then tried those out.</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.880" end="01:37:43.699" style="s2">Then we implement the ones that we think are<br />great.</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.699" end="01:37:48.110" style="s2">Then you might think, well we’ve been doing<br />that for a very, very, very long time.</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.110" end="01:37:52.910" style="s2">then you might think, maybe we’ve figured<br />out exactly what thing we should implement,</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.910" end="01:37:57.670" style="s2">then we might say well that’s the savior<br />figures in mythology.</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.670" end="01:38:00.280" style="s2">That’s what they are.</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.280" end="01:38:02.219" style="s2">What else would they be?</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.219" end="01:38:05.280" style="s2">People have been trying to figure out what<br />the hell we are forever.</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.280" end="01:38:10.840" style="s2">The fundamental question, what is reality<br />made of, is not the fundamental question.</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.840" end="01:38:15.090" style="s2">The fundamental question is, how do you act<br />in the world?</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.090" end="01:38:18.510" style="s2">That’s a whole different way of thinking<br />about the world, but I think, given that I’m</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.510" end="01:38:23.770" style="s2">a Darwinian, I think it’s the fundamental<br />question.</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.770" end="01:38:29.920" style="s2">You know, obviously, given what I’ve described<br />to you so far, you can’t fall in love too</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.920" end="01:38:33.090" style="s2">much with your current self.</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.090" end="01:38:34.150" style="s2">What if it’s wrong?</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.150" end="01:38:35.850" style="s2">Then you should let that sucker die.</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.850" end="01:38:41.110" style="s2">Then you might think, well what part of you<br />is it that doesn’t die when your avatars</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.110" end="01:38:42.110" style="s2">die.</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.110" end="01:38:43.750" style="s2">Well that’s what Jung called the self.</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.750" end="01:38:46.500" style="s2">Let’s say you undergo a personality transformation.</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.500" end="01:38:50.469" style="s2">There’s the old you, you’re all naïve<br />and something comes along and just wallops</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.469" end="01:38:51.469" style="s2">you, bang!</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.469" end="01:38:52.960" style="s2">Into the underworld, you fall apart.</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.960" end="01:38:53.960" style="s2">Then, bang!</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.960" end="01:38:55.860" style="s2">There’s a new you.</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.860" end="01:38:59.180" style="s2">Maybe a little battle weary, but wiser.</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.180" end="01:39:04.690" style="s2">Then you know that one gets walloped out and<br />into the underworld and up you come again.</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.690" end="01:39:07.949" style="s2">Fine, what’s constant across all of those<br />transformations?</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.949" end="01:39:11.470" style="s2">That’s the core element of the person.</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.470" end="01:39:14.480" style="s2">That’s what Jung called the self.</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.480" end="01:39:21.989" style="s2">Brilliant, it’s so smart.</p>
