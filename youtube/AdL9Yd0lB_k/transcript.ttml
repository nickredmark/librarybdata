<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:33.959" style="s2">like to begin with a central metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.079" end="00:02:36.920" style="s2">for doing this practice it was a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.959" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">metaphor that comes from Satara Gotama</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:43.980" style="s2">Buddhism and I&#39;ve already indicated I am</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.909" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">doing an ecology of practices some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.980" end="00:02:47.000" style="s2">which are drawn from the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">tradition some from the Taoist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.000" end="00:02:52.049" style="s2">and some from a secular scientific</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">framework but nevertheless the Buddha is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.049" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">a very valuable resource that we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:59.549" style="s2">make use of the buddha buddha pointed</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.769" style="s2">out that the attitude you should take in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.549" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">a meditative practice is you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.769" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">to befriend yourself you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">learn how to take the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">yourself that you would take to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.739" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">that you are cultivating a deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:15.150" style="s2">friendship with so i&#39;m going to teach</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:17.489" style="s2">you how to come into how to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.150" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">come into that proper relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.489" end="00:03:21.780" style="s2">yourself and i&#39;m going to teach you what</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">i call the core for for coming into that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.780" end="00:03:25.889" style="s2">proper relationship of offending</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">yourself i&#39;m finding your Center</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.889" end="00:03:30.299" style="s2">finding your root finding it flow and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:32.819" style="s2">finding your focus so that&#39;s we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.299" end="00:03:34.739" style="s2">work on first so as I said normally</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.819" end="00:03:36.950" style="s2">Mondays and Thursdays we&#39;ll type a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.739" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">teaching class those are on 40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.950" end="00:03:42.449" style="s2">Tuesdays Wednesdays Fridays and Saturday</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:44.099" style="s2">you can meet me here again at 9:30 but</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.449" end="00:03:45.900" style="s2">those will only be half an hour and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.099" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">those will be just a sitting I&#39;ll do a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.900" end="00:03:50.730" style="s2">brief reminder of what we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll sit and then they&#39;ll be a Q&amp;A so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.730" end="00:03:55.530" style="s2">we&#39;re friending yourself by finding your</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">Center so what does that mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.530" end="00:04:00.389" style="s2">oldest meditation manuals we have is in</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">fact translated as centering and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.389" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">often say they want to find their Center</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">but we need to move beyond sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">cliche we need to get into the depths of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">what this can mean for us and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:14.519" style="s2">the things you can think about is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:16.169" style="s2">relationship between mind and body one</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.519" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">of the ways we can be friend our selves</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.169" end="00:04:20.010" style="s2">is to get the proper relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">between mind and body now often they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.010" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">there they&#39;re not communicating properly</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">and they may even have an up to an</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:30.120" style="s2">antagonistic relationship so</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:31.979" style="s2">your body is tired and hungry and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.120" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">makes it hard to think or you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.979" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">stressed out and anxious or that was all</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:37.710" style="s2">kinds of tension in your body so one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:39.659" style="s2">the things we do first there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.710" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">aspects defining your Center it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.659" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">to be centering your posture centering</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">your tension centering your attitude and</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:48.300" style="s2">we Center our posture and it&#39;s by going</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:49.949" style="s2">through a particular exercise I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.300" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">explain to you what the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.949" end="00:04:56.039" style="s2">centering your posture is and what this</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:58.319" style="s2">exercise is so if I sit just normally</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.039" end="00:05:00.840" style="s2">without this is called as a foo a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.319" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">meditation pillow underneath my body</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.840" end="00:05:05.159" style="s2">what happens is because of evolution I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:06.659" style="s2">have an s-curve in my spine and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.159" end="00:05:09.389" style="s2">want to hold myself tense right and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.659" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">if I relaxed you see what happens I get</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.389" end="00:05:14.219" style="s2">a curve in my spine my chest closes in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:16.259" style="s2">my stomach closes in and so what I get</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.219" end="00:05:18.029" style="s2">is shallow chest breathing and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.259" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">problem with shallow chest breathing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.029" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">it is very deeply associated in your</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:25.979" style="s2">brain with anxiety with tension with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:28.199" style="s2">distress so you don&#39;t want that so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.979" end="00:05:30.029" style="s2">need what&#39;s called your loft and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.199" end="00:05:31.979" style="s2">that is is you&#39;re trying to enact a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.029" end="00:05:33.960" style="s2">basic postural principle the basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.979" end="00:05:36.539" style="s2">postural principle is you want your</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.960" end="00:05:39.419" style="s2">knees level or impossible below your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.539" end="00:05:41.599" style="s2">hips so you need something under your</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.419" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">butt now you can sit two ways I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.599" end="00:05:45.629" style="s2">recommend for people who are initially</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:48.210" style="s2">sitting you might want to sit this way</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.629" end="00:05:50.219" style="s2">cross-legged in front with your knees</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.210" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">down so sit towards the edge of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.219" end="00:05:54.629" style="s2">pillow and your knees down like this</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">this is usually easier for beginners</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.629" end="00:06:00.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not all finally the best posture if</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.069" style="s2">you can and you need to experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.180" end="00:06:05.339" style="s2">your posture and we&#39;ll come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.069" end="00:06:07.949" style="s2">towards the end of today&#39;s session but</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.339" end="00:06:12.919" style="s2">if you can this is actually a preferred</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.949" end="00:06:12.919" style="s2">posture for sitting kneeling like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.879" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">because what happens when people sit</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.349" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">cross-legged is their hips are usually</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">slightly lateralized and that puts a bit</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.180" end="00:06:35.219" style="s2">then at the very end of the exercise you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.159" end="00:06:37.800" style="s2">can lean back slightly to take the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.219" end="00:06:39.490" style="s2">pressure off your back or what some</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.490" end="00:06:42.580" style="s2">they go through the centering exercise</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.169" end="00:06:44.740" style="s2">and then once they&#39;re centered they lean</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.580" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">back slightly against the wall to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.740" end="00:06:49.449" style="s2">the pressure off their back alright so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:51.910" style="s2">what I want to do is show you now that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.449" end="00:06:54.759" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting this way what happens is my</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.910" end="00:06:56.199" style="s2">stomach is open my chest is open and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.759" end="00:06:58.780" style="s2">shoulders are down and that allows</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.199" end="00:07:00.580" style="s2">what&#39;s called baby breathing now this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.780" end="00:07:03.160" style="s2">a very important principle unless I give</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.580" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">you specific instructions let your</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.160" end="00:07:07.539" style="s2">breathing be as natural as possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">that&#39;s how babies breathe how do babies</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.539" end="00:07:11.169" style="s2">breathe they do belly breathing they</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:13.030" style="s2">expand their abdomen you can put your</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.169" end="00:07:15.310" style="s2">hands on your abdomen you can feel your</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.030" end="00:07:18.849" style="s2">abdomen expanding when you inhale and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.310" end="00:07:21.009" style="s2">exhaling contracting when you exhale try</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.849" end="00:07:23.409" style="s2">not to breathe by lifting and dropping</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.009" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">your shoulders okay because that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.409" end="00:07:27.490" style="s2">and your aggression tension you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:30.190" style="s2">be baby breathing because it puts you</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.490" end="00:07:32.229" style="s2">into a natural relaxed state but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.190" end="00:07:34.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make you sleepy because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.229" end="00:07:37.180" style="s2">using most of your lungs and your</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.090" end="00:07:38.949" style="s2">abdomen and you&#39;re getting lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.180" end="00:07:40.990" style="s2">of oxygen into your bloat so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.949" end="00:07:43.389" style="s2">do baby breathing so this area is called</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:46.210" style="s2">your Don Tian let your breathing drop as</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.389" end="00:07:49.240" style="s2">low as low as possible don&#39;t force it</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.210" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">don&#39;t force it into your abdomen and try</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.240" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">to engage in the baby breathing and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:56.130" style="s2">you want your chest open your shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.110" end="00:07:59.259" style="s2">down and you place your hands on your</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.130" end="00:08:02.050" style="s2">legs in a way that will do the following</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.259" end="00:08:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;ll keep your shoulders open right</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.050" end="00:08:05.229" style="s2">your chest open your shoulders down and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.880" end="00:08:07.630" style="s2">it will add to your sense of stability</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.229" end="00:08:09.069" style="s2">you can place your hands like this some</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.630" end="00:08:11.440" style="s2">people put their hands in their lap like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.069" end="00:08:13.419" style="s2">this yeah one thing you do and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.440" end="00:08:16.090" style="s2">something I prefer to do my hands sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.419" end="00:08:18.340" style="s2">of slightly aside like this that works</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.090" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">for me you may find directly palm up</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.340" end="00:08:22.330" style="s2">works for you but you can do the chin</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:24.310" style="s2">mudra you can lightly touch your thumb</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.330" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to do this but you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.310" end="00:08:28.750" style="s2">lightly touch your thumbs to your index</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.789" style="s2">finger and you can feel the pulse there</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.750" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">why that&#39;s important is because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.789" end="00:08:34.839" style="s2">trying to train two ways of looking in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.430" end="00:08:36.969" style="s2">where you have two eyes sort of looking</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.839" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">inward one is introspection you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.969" end="00:08:42.279" style="s2">familiar with that which is looking into</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:43.539" style="s2">your mind like when I ask you what are</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.279" end="00:08:44.529" style="s2">you thinking about right now or to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.539" end="00:08:46.810" style="s2">imagine a sailboat</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.529" end="00:08:49.630" style="s2">that&#39;s introspection but you also want</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.810" end="00:08:51.880" style="s2">interior ception interoception that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.630" end="00:08:53.230" style="s2">your feeling into your body like if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.880" end="00:08:55.480" style="s2">if you feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.230" end="00:08:57.580" style="s2">something&#39;s wrong with my stomach or you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:08:58.210" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t feel quite right here in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.580" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">my chest</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.210" end="00:09:03.490" style="s2">that&#39;s interception when you do the chin</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:04.860" style="s2">mudra and you pick up on that pulse and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.490" end="00:09:07.090" style="s2">you can actually enhance your</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.860" end="00:09:08.590" style="s2">interception and we&#39;re going to talk in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.090" end="00:09:11.050" style="s2">the course while you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.590" end="00:09:13.470" style="s2">enhancing both your introspection and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.050" end="00:09:16.630" style="s2">your interior reception okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.470" end="00:09:19.450" style="s2">interception okay so you can place your</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.630" end="00:09:21.400" style="s2">hands how they&#39;re going to be that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.450" end="00:09:24.520" style="s2">gives you that stability perhaps using</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.400" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">the chin mudra and then we want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.520" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">a postural problem with our head which</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:29.950" style="s2">is people tend to let their head roll</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.470" style="s2">forward especially if they&#39;re novices</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.950" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">don&#39;t do that because this is sending</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.470" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">the signal to your brain that you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:39.010" style="s2">to fall asleep and we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:41.230" style="s2">between two things that your brain wants</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.010" end="00:09:42.910" style="s2">to do when you close your eyes you look</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.230" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">inward when you close your eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.910" end="00:09:45.340" style="s2">looking with your brain goes oh I know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">what you want to do you&#39;re daydreaming</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.340" end="00:09:48.760" style="s2">and it&#39;ll start do all the day driven</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:50.380" style="s2">and we want to get out of that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.760" end="00:09:51.850" style="s2">and then you when you get out of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.380" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">your brain goes oh I know what you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.850" end="00:09:54.730" style="s2">to do you want to fall asleep and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:57.010" style="s2">want to get out of that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.730" end="00:10:01.450" style="s2">steer between those two so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.010" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">keep your head level alright so what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.450" end="00:10:06.670" style="s2">want to do now don&#39;t do it yet I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:07.870" style="s2">to talk you through it so just listen</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.670" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">through the instructions first please</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.870" end="00:10:12.730" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll talk you through it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.260" style="s2">going to do an exercise in order to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.730" end="00:10:17.740" style="s2">your Center I don&#39;t let you sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.260" end="00:10:20.770" style="s2">use visual cues and Cartesian graph</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.740" end="00:10:23.530" style="s2">fashion calculate your Center I want you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.770" end="00:10:25.000" style="s2">to find your Center and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.530" end="00:10:27.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do again don&#39;t do it yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.000" end="00:10:28.660" style="s2">please watch and listen and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.160" end="00:10:30.280" style="s2">talk you through it we&#39;re going to close</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.660" end="00:10:31.510" style="s2">our eyes and we&#39;re going to and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.280" end="00:10:33.070" style="s2">very important to close your eyes for</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.510" end="00:10:35.560" style="s2">this exercise or else you&#39;ll rely on</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.070" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">visual cues okay you can close your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.560" end="00:10:40.570" style="s2">you&#39;re going to use your middle ears</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:42.220" style="s2">vestibular function it&#39;s 400 million</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.570" end="00:10:43.750" style="s2">years old it will send all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:45.610" style="s2">reliable signals to you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.750" end="00:10:47.260" style="s2">balanced okay and you&#39;re gonna roll</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.610" end="00:10:49.420" style="s2">forward and you&#39;re going to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.260" end="00:10:52.570" style="s2">sensations of being off-center forward</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.420" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">and then backwards and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.570" end="00:10:58.030" style="s2">do that a little less each time slowly</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:59.860" style="s2">by tracking the sensations slowly</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.030" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">tracking it on where you feel centered</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.860" end="00:11:06.529" style="s2">back to front and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:08.509" style="s2">do the same thing side to side okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.529" end="00:11:09.980" style="s2">and then in order to make sure we got</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.509" end="00:11:12.139" style="s2">our head properly in place given what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.980" end="00:11:16.220" style="s2">just said a few minutes ago we do our</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.139" end="00:11:18.019" style="s2">head back to front and side to side once</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.220" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">we are centered in that way we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.019" end="00:11:22.100" style="s2">to sink into our center what that means</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:25.639" style="s2">is we&#39;re going to try and open our leg</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.100" end="00:11:27.529" style="s2">and abdomen and chest muscles and our</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.639" end="00:11:30.050" style="s2">neck muscles as much as possible we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.529" end="00:11:32.089" style="s2">not going Lin we&#39;re doing it as much so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.050" end="00:11:33.319" style="s2">that we can reliably feel state because</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.089" end="00:11:35.749" style="s2">you&#39;re probably holding a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.319" end="00:11:36.410" style="s2">unnecessary tension in all of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.749" end="00:11:39.170" style="s2">muscles</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.410" end="00:11:41.749" style="s2">once you sink into your Center I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.170" end="00:11:43.939" style="s2">savor your Center what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.749" end="00:11:45.980" style="s2">do here is really like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.939" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">you&#39;re like somebody put some food in</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.980" end="00:11:49.639" style="s2">your mouth and you want to really</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:51.559" style="s2">heighten the sensation of the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.639" end="00:11:53.990" style="s2">oh I want to remember what this feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.559" end="00:11:55.910" style="s2">like in the same way you want to try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.990" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2">create a felt memory of what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.910" end="00:12:01.129" style="s2">to be centered okay so everybody start</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:04.309" style="s2">you know getting into your basic posture</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.129" end="00:12:05.990" style="s2">and then close your eyes I&#39;m going to</p>

<p begin="00:13:39.330" end="00:13:42.350" style="s2">with your mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.910" end="00:14:01.590" style="s2">okay slowly open your eyes please so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.400" end="00:14:02.790" style="s2">whenever we sit we&#39;re gonna find your</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.590" end="00:14:03.750" style="s2">Center now I&#39;ve been doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.790" end="00:14:05.310" style="s2">years so I don&#39;t have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.750" end="00:14:07.500" style="s2">exercise I can just sit and find my</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.310" end="00:14:10.740" style="s2">Center for a long time you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.500" end="00:14:11.580" style="s2">through the exercise until you can find</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.740" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">your Center</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.580" end="00:14:15.390" style="s2">so that&#39;s centering your posture now</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">centering your attention obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.390" end="00:14:18.750" style="s2">means to focus your attention but it</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">means much more I&#39;m going to use an</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.750" end="00:14:23.460" style="s2">analogy first of all let me explain the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">one part of the analogy think about my</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.460" end="00:14:27.870" style="s2">glasses right now how they frame my</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:30.450" style="s2">experience and I&#39;m seeing through them</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.870" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">in both senses of the word I&#39;m seeing by</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.450" end="00:14:35.010" style="s2">means of them and beyond them but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:36.900" style="s2">actually not aware of my glasses I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.010" end="00:14:38.700" style="s2">aware through them but sometimes my</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.900" end="00:14:39.900" style="s2">glasses distort my awareness so what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.700" end="00:14:42.270" style="s2">have to do is I have to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.900" end="00:14:44.400" style="s2">not look through them step back and look</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.270" end="00:14:46.680" style="s2">at them step back and look at them</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.400" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">normally we&#39;re not looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.680" end="00:14:50.790" style="s2">process and patterns within our mind and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.770" style="s2">body we&#39;re looking through them out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.790" end="00:14:54.510" style="s2">world and so what we want to do is we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.770" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">want to practice stepping back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.510" end="00:14:59.960" style="s2">looking at our mental framing rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:02.910" style="s2">than automatically and unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.960" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">looking through it so how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.910" end="00:15:07.020" style="s2">well the primary way in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.800" end="00:15:08.820" style="s2">aware of the world is through our</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.020" end="00:15:12.150" style="s2">sensation from touching the floor right</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.820" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">now all right so what I want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.150" end="00:15:17.400" style="s2">instead of being aware through my</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:19.770" style="s2">sensations I want to be aware of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.400" end="00:15:23.100" style="s2">sensations and the way that I do that as</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.770" end="00:15:24.930" style="s2">I pick sensations that are easy to track</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.100" end="00:15:27.390" style="s2">because their sensations that are more</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.930" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">touch vision is too fast to start with</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.390" end="00:15:32.220" style="s2">so I want to start with sensations of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:34.230" style="s2">touch sort of bodily awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.220" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">something that&#39;s always with me which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.230" end="00:15:39.510" style="s2">the sensations being generated in my</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">abdomen by my grieving so as I breathe</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.510" end="00:15:44.340" style="s2">in I feel those sensations and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:46.170" style="s2">mentally say to myself but mental word</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.340" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">that I&#39;m silently saying to myself is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.170" end="00:15:50.070" style="s2">only a lens I don&#39;t concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">word I use it to focus my attention on</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.070" end="00:15:59.730" style="s2">those sensations and I say in and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">out in and then out tracking the change</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.730" end="00:16:04.830" style="s2">and flow of the sensations now what will</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.300" style="s2">happen is I&#39;ll get distracted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.830" end="00:16:08.870" style="s2">called your monkey mind it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.300" end="00:16:10.510" style="s2">monkey that leaps around and chatters</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.870" end="00:16:13.389" style="s2">because you go in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:15.490" style="s2">to thinking about or sensing the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.389" end="00:16:17.079" style="s2">so you won&#39;t be looking at your mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.490" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">you&#39;ll be looking through your mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.079" end="00:16:20.110" style="s2">you&#39;ll be thinking about the laundry you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:22.149" style="s2">have to do remembering their</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.110" end="00:16:24.040" style="s2">conversation you had worrying about a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.149" end="00:16:26.310" style="s2">problem in your life maybe listening to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.040" end="00:16:29.500" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in your room or outside</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.310" end="00:16:31.660" style="s2">okay so when that happens you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.500" end="00:16:33.160" style="s2">to step back and look at the distraction</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.660" end="00:16:34.510" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get involved with</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.160" end="00:16:36.040" style="s2">the contents let&#39;s say you have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.510" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">thought don&#39;t get involved with that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.040" end="00:16:40.029" style="s2">your thoughts about step back and label</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:42.670" style="s2">the process remember we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.029" end="00:16:44.410" style="s2">focus on the process and patterns label</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.670" end="00:16:46.930" style="s2">the process with an ING word like</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.410" end="00:16:51.910" style="s2">thinking imagining wondering complaining</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.930" end="00:16:53.800" style="s2">listening okay don&#39;t worry about being</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.910" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">super precise in your labeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.800" end="00:16:57.610" style="s2">just get you what intuitively comes up</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:17:00.279" style="s2">first is more than sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.610" end="00:17:04.780" style="s2">so you label your distraction with an</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.279" end="00:17:06.579" style="s2">ING word and then you return your</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.780" end="00:17:10.150" style="s2">attention to the sensations and your</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.579" end="00:17:11.949" style="s2">breath this is where we bring in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.150" end="00:17:14.260" style="s2">third thing we&#39;re training we train our</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.949" end="00:17:17.140" style="s2">attitude and I want to use an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.260" end="00:17:18.730" style="s2">analogy from John cornfield one of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.470" end="00:18:38.260" style="s2">very little time in it in an attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.320" end="00:18:40.570" style="s2">against it in this practice it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:43.540" style="s2">that it actually works it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.000" end="00:38:27.079" style="s2">to become a Buddha it means neither of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.770" end="00:38:28.430" style="s2">those right it just means areas of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.079" end="00:38:30.410" style="s2">brain are starting to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.430" end="00:38:32.690" style="s2">that have not been normally talking to</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.410" end="00:38:37.790" style="s2">each other label those as a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.690" end="00:38:40.970" style="s2">and return now if you&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.790" end="00:38:44.150" style="s2">trauma or in therapy very important that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.970" end="00:38:45.790" style="s2">you talk to therapists and let them know</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.150" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">you&#39;re doing this mindfulness properties</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.790" end="00:38:50.270" style="s2">if you experience the trauma and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:52.190" style="s2">not in therapy I would recommend you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.270" end="00:38:54.380" style="s2">consider not undertaking this practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.190" end="00:38:57.049" style="s2">right now until you get into a stable</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.450" end="00:39:04.220" style="s2">again please treat any of those unusual</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.150" end="00:39:06.200" style="s2">experience distractions and return to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.220" end="00:39:09.170" style="s2">your breath but if you meditate in</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.200" end="00:39:14.059" style="s2">darkness it&#39;ll tend to exacerbate those</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.170" end="00:39:17.540" style="s2">odd experiences for you it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.059" end="00:39:19.069" style="s2">if you can to practice twice a day but</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.540" end="00:39:20.599" style="s2">again be going practice once and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.069" end="00:39:22.130" style="s2">practice once today you&#39;ll be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.599" end="00:39:24.200" style="s2">if when you join me in the sittings</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.130" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">every morning except for Sunday there</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.200" end="00:39:27.799" style="s2">won&#39;t be any sittings together on Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:31.160" style="s2">but I suggest you still sit on your own</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.799" end="00:39:33.020" style="s2">on Sunday so I now want to turn to some</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.849" end="00:39:37.819" style="s2">problems and I want to address some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.680" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">those questions because they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.819" end="00:39:42.859" style="s2">good ones before I move on on to some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:46.849" style="s2">the novel questions we might get from</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.859" end="00:39:48.349" style="s2">today one question was from Blessed now</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.849" end="00:39:50.119" style="s2">is that okay that my legs get strained</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.349" end="00:39:51.980" style="s2">when I meditate on my knees well first</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.119" end="00:39:52.869" style="s2">of all you as I said experiment with</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.980" end="00:39:55.339" style="s2">your posture</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.869" end="00:39:58.130" style="s2">you might try crossly that will reduce</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.339" end="00:40:00.290" style="s2">the tension but it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.130" end="00:40:02.599" style="s2">frame that experiment experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.290" end="00:40:03.770" style="s2">properly do you not get it into your</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.599" end="00:40:05.750" style="s2">mind that you&#39;re going to find the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.770" end="00:40:09.500" style="s2">perfect posture that will remove you</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.750" end="00:40:11.750" style="s2">from all feelings of discomfort and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.500" end="00:40:12.609" style="s2">you will feel sort of loss of sensations</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.579" end="00:40:24.789" style="s2">that&#39;s relatively good for you but</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.229" end="00:40:27.099" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get a keenness in your</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:07.660" style="s2">my posture also seems to be inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.439" end="00:41:09.369" style="s2">being my focus is as a rotate okay to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.660" end="00:41:11.799" style="s2">lie down to meditate this is from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.369" end="00:41:14.109" style="s2">McEntire no that&#39;s not a good idea if</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.799" end="00:41:16.029" style="s2">the problem is as I say back pain then</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.109" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">use the chair method that I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.029" end="00:41:21.009" style="s2">described or use the wall method the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:23.199" style="s2">problem when you lay down is it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.009" end="00:41:25.150" style="s2">exacerbate those disorientation feelings</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.199" end="00:41:27.219" style="s2">and it can make the weirdness worse or</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.150" end="00:41:29.079" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t do that there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.219" end="00:41:30.549" style="s2">chance you will fall asleep and as I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.079" end="00:41:33.880" style="s2">mentioned you&#39;re trying to get between</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.549" end="00:41:35.739" style="s2">monkey mind and falling asleep it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.880" end="00:41:37.150" style="s2">middle path and it&#39;s very narrow right</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.739" end="00:41:39.670" style="s2">now you&#39;re like on the edge of a wedge</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.150" end="00:41:42.549" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna open as you move into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.670" end="00:41:43.509" style="s2">um it&#39;s a good idea not to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.549" end="00:41:45.729" style="s2">right before you&#39;re going to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.509" end="00:41:47.739" style="s2">because you might fall asleep and your</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.729" end="00:41:49.719" style="s2">meditation or you might get fully sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.739" end="00:41:52.809" style="s2">of awake and present and therefore I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.719" end="00:41:54.309" style="s2">reduce your capacity for going to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.809" end="00:41:57.089" style="s2">if you want to meditate in the evening I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.309" end="00:41:59.410" style="s2">suggest like an hour after dinner or so</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.089" end="00:42:00.759" style="s2">another question from Spencer if I get</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.410" end="00:42:02.349" style="s2">an insight while meditating should I</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.759" end="00:42:05.499" style="s2">just labor look like I would any other</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.349" end="00:42:07.329" style="s2">monkey mind moment yes exactly and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.499" end="00:42:09.369" style="s2">the scientific research shows that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.329" end="00:42:12.249" style="s2">kind of mindfulness practice engenders</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.369" end="00:42:13.900" style="s2">insight so but you don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.249" end="00:42:15.939" style="s2">caught up on it and you have to trust</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.900" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">the fact that that sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.939" end="00:42:21.489" style="s2">proclivity towards insight is going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:23.739" style="s2">carry into your daily life if you focus</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.489" end="00:42:25.600" style="s2">on it in your meditation then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.739" end="00:42:28.150" style="s2">going to transfer that insight ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.600" end="00:42:30.070" style="s2">really need it which is into the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.150" end="00:42:32.410" style="s2">what you can do and some people do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.070" end="00:42:34.270" style="s2">they keep a journal here and they tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.410" end="00:42:35.620" style="s2">themselves all you know all right when I</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.270" end="00:42:37.870" style="s2">come out of my meditation all write down</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.620" end="00:42:39.640" style="s2">any insights I might have don&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.870" end="00:42:41.740" style="s2">hold them in your mind for writing let</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.640" end="00:42:43.870" style="s2">them go and if you remember them you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.740" end="00:42:45.640" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t and but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.870" end="00:42:48.070" style="s2">might come back to them it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.640" end="00:42:50.290" style="s2">also to perhaps Bailey with horror to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.070" end="00:42:51.790" style="s2">how your meditation practice is going</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.290" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">because it helps to build your awareness</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.790" end="00:42:56.070" style="s2">of your inner teacher and the tradition</p>
