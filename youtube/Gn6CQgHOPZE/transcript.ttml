<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.609" style="s2">decide what I want to talk about is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.689" end="00:00:07.080" style="s2">foundational economic concept maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.609" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">financial concept depending on your</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">preference so the notion is this</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">remember we&#39;ve taken the idea in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">city we&#39;ve separated the virtual and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:19.470" style="s2">physical into and decouple them into two</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:22.230" style="s2">different objects now what I&#39;d like you</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:24.330" style="s2">to use I imagine a landscape and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.230" end="00:00:26.609" style="s2">give it hills and valleys and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.330" end="00:00:29.730" style="s2">imagine rain that falls evenly on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.609" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">landscape now we&#39;re gonna call that that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.730" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">rain value and what we&#39;ll notice is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">like rain falling on a on a valley the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">the water will tend to slide down from</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:42.270" style="s2">the hills and gather in the valleys turn</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">into rivers then eventually pour into a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.270" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">pond or a lake if the landscape is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:49.350" style="s2">appropriately shaped as it turns out the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">same sort of thing happens with value</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.350" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">and so in the context of the physical in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.260" style="s2">the context of the physical side of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">city um the thing we call real estate</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.260" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">land might be thought of as being a low</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">point in the attractor space of value</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">distribution and what this means is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">if you were to measure the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:16.470" style="s2">of value in an economy the owners of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">real estate will actually tend to accrue</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.470" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">a disproportionate share more than their</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">fair share to the point particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">visa vie the amount of data they</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:28.130" style="s2">actually generate into the economy so</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">the eyes that&#39;s produced in the economy</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.130" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">will have more return to real estate</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">than it will to other locations higher</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">up on the stack of the economy the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.600" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">thing is true by the way in the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">domain although it&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:44.490" style="s2">abstract so if you imagine like in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">old PC ecosystem for those if you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.490" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">old enough to remember that you had all</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">these applications like Word Excel and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:54.090" style="s2">guess web browsers and these were the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">value these are the things that people</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.090" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">wanted games but the value actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">nerd mostly to the operating system and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the equivalent of real estate in</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">the early internet and ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:10.950" style="s2">ultimately being search so yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">Google and then in web 2.0 ended up</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">being the sort of the social media</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:16.570" style="s2">platform</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.300" end="00:02:17.860" style="s2">Twitter YouTube Facebook and what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.570" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">might say is that in the virtual space</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.860" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">it is the the most basic cynic went on</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">or cannot do without aspect of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:30.130" style="s2">makes Metcalfe&#39;s law work what makes the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:31.690" style="s2">network effect a network effect so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.130" end="00:02:34.900" style="s2">lower you can go in the stack to get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.690" end="00:02:38.680" style="s2">the point where an individual joining</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.900" end="00:02:40.600" style="s2">creates a network effect and then and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.680" end="00:02:42.790" style="s2">then have applications sit on top of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.600" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">that that thing that platform is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.790" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">place that is the virtual equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:49.060" style="s2">real-estate value will tend to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">disproportionately collect in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.060" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">location and then if you can own that if</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.150" style="s2">you can have a property ownership of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:56.890" style="s2">you will actually end up extracting</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.150" end="00:02:58.810" style="s2">value from the larger economy they will</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.890" end="00:03:01.540" style="s2">float to you disproportionate to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.810" end="00:03:04.810" style="s2">amount of data that you&#39;re putting in so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.540" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">we can say for example that as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.810" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">a basic rule principle of design that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:14.020" style="s2">there should be a symmetry rule in terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:16.090" style="s2">of value meaning if I produce X in value</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.020" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">I should have X and ie return to me</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.090" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">neither more nor less and so for</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:26.709" style="s2">therefore for example I&#39;m well oriented</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">in in where in how effective my choices</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.709" end="00:03:31.390" style="s2">are right if I produce X and I get less</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">the next and I&#39;m actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.390" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">doing less of what is actually valuable</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:37.480" style="s2">because I&#39;m not feeling the value of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:39.510" style="s2">myself and vice-versa alright if I&#39;d if</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.480" end="00:03:41.770" style="s2">I&#39;d if I do X and I get more than X then</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.510" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll actually be wasting my time</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.770" end="00:03:44.830" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s time by doing something</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:48.010" style="s2">section not as valuable I perceive it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.830" end="00:03:49.690" style="s2">be so there&#39;s a good basic principle now</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.010" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">what we noticed is that because of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.690" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">topology of these value landscapes sorry</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:58.030" style="s2">topography of these i/o landscapes</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:03:59.590" style="s2">owning land has a characteristic of much</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.030" end="00:04:01.330" style="s2">more than X and I put a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.590" end="00:04:02.590" style="s2">of value into the economy but I get</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.330" end="00:04:04.420" style="s2">actually substantially more than that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.590" end="00:04:08.980" style="s2">back so this will disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.420" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">cause people to seek owning land</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.980" end="00:04:12.580" style="s2">same thing with owning platforms it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">creates the wrong kinds of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.580" end="00:04:19.030" style="s2">loops so in the context of Scythian what</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.459" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">we will have is a rule very basic at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.030" end="00:04:24.070" style="s2">foundational level that these two</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">objects and if others like this are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.070" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">discovered must be held as a common</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:31.479" style="s2">so that it cannot be held or owned by</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:34.509" style="s2">any particular actor the the value that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.479" end="00:04:36.550" style="s2">collects in these value attractors has</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.509" end="00:04:39.580" style="s2">to be looped back out and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.550" end="00:04:42.129" style="s2">pro rata to each value creator that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.580" end="00:04:43.900" style="s2">actually creates a symmetry and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.129" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">therefore Orient&#39;s the choice making of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.900" end="00:04:47.800" style="s2">the larger community more effectively so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:49.599" style="s2">what that means practically is that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:52.090" style="s2">you were a citizen if you&#39;re a full</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.599" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">member of the city &#39;m you will have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.090" end="00:04:59.050" style="s2">pro rata share in all of the land and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:05:02.650" style="s2">pro rata share of the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.050" end="00:05:04.930" style="s2">technical platform and that were more of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.650" end="00:05:06.849" style="s2">us return to you on a continuing basis</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.930" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">the value that accrues to those</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.849" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">locations will then be redistributed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s the symmetric member</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:14.550" style="s2">spoiler alert this will look a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:17.969" style="s2">UVI</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.550" end="00:05:17.969" style="s2">as you go forward</p>
