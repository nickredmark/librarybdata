<p begin="00:00:31.140" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">still figuring this out but um but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:42.210" style="s2">been so grateful for all the way the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">ways of participation in the in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.210" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">conversation as expressed through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">comments it&#39;s also been a place a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.450" end="00:00:53.160" style="s2">bit of a dilemma for me because I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">to respond to every one of them but I am</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.160" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">NOT a good typer it takes me a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:00.359" style="s2">to type small right and it and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a it&#39;s been a something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.359" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">been kind of wiggling in me of wanting</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">to respond to everybody but trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.510" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">figure out how to do that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">should I get to everything else in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:17.430" style="s2">life as well so my thought was as like</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">Chris Wahab we just make a video and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.430" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">just go through each one of the comments</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">and like we can just respond to them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">however way that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">responding to them as a as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">possibly including everyone into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">dialogue and let and letting you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">that you&#39;re having an impact on on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">dialogue and an appreciation for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">and and a response cuz there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:48.630" style="s2">like I&#39;ve been so impressed with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">thoughts that have come come in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.630" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">comments section I&#39;m just like whoa that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even think this particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">angle or this train of thought it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">like so it&#39;s actually for YouTube having</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">that having that the tone of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">conversation be so warm</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">right like it just people&#39;s comments be</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">like assuming positive intention like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">assuming goodwill like a genuine arrest</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">city like I&#39;ve that&#39;s I know YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">not known for their their generous</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">manatee and their in the comment section</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:31.830" style="s2">so remotely no to have that happen and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:33.870" style="s2">to not have it be polemical to have it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.830" end="00:02:36.870" style="s2">be really good natured and in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.870" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">is a novelty a novelty to be grateful</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.870" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">for and then around that novelty I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:43.020" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to find a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">etiquette it&#39;s that&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.020" end="00:02:47.220" style="s2">so I mean established you can&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">established etiquette with a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:51.240" style="s2">phenomenon right so then this I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:53.430" style="s2">for maybe what this is in part is trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.240" end="00:02:57.720" style="s2">to renegotiate a new etiquette for a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.430" end="00:02:59.490" style="s2">phenomenon because III go that guy I see</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.720" end="00:03:01.800" style="s2">some of the comments on any number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.490" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">these videos are enough to warrant their</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.800" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">own dialogues just some of the single</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:10.740" style="s2">comments you know to say nothing of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:12.570" style="s2">long conversations are enough to warrant</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.740" end="00:03:15.570" style="s2">their own dialogues and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.570" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">difficult to know how to respond because</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.570" end="00:03:19.050" style="s2">you want to be consistent and you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">to be you want to honor the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.050" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">participation and dignify it properly so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s tricky so I think this was</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">an excellent idea this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:31.380" style="s2">really good experimental exercise yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">totally so let&#39;s give it a shot so my</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.380" end="00:03:35.310" style="s2">thought is look Laura I&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">along and it will read a comment and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.310" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">will comment on it and just kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">see where we go from there okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.800" end="00:03:50.190" style="s2">get people all right so the first one</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">from NIC and I&#39;ll go ahead and attempt</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.190" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">to read the read it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">NIC states the only talk about it made</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">me realize the ways and the wins I</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">experienced the world it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">numinous it&#39;s the numinous my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">grandfather&#39;s house is it that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:23.010" style="s2">vow it demands respect</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:26.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t experience it as a now facing me</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.010" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">but more a presence of something greater</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.789" end="00:04:29.270" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:35.310" style="s2">so this is really synchronistic for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.270" end="00:04:38.610" style="s2">because so thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.310" end="00:04:39.390" style="s2">thank you for that comment Nick and if</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.610" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">the reason that synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.390" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">synchronistic for me is that my my</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">grandmother recently she&#39;s she&#39;s in her</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.810" style="s2">mid to late 80s but but thank goodness</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">she&#39;s still strong as a bull and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:56.190" style="s2">just recently sold her house that she</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:59.090" style="s2">shared with my grandfather for many many</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.190" end="00:05:01.170" style="s2">many years and moved into an apartment</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.090" end="00:05:02.700" style="s2">completely self-sufficiently and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.170" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">independent and left to her own devices</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.700" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">and that house my grandmother&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:15.540" style="s2">has also been avowed to me for as long</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:17.940" style="s2">as I can remember and the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.540" end="00:05:19.350" style="s2">character and I&#39;m deliberately gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.940" end="00:05:21.090" style="s2">back to our conversation and our</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.350" end="00:05:22.680" style="s2">discussion of characterization a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.090" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">bit but the character that that house</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.680" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">had over and above any particular person</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">or inhabitant in it signified in a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:37.800" style="s2">that seemed irreducible to me and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.390" style="s2">seemed untransferable and so when she</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.800" end="00:05:42.030" style="s2">sold her house even though logistically</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.390" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">it was exactly the right thing for her</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.030" end="00:05:47.070" style="s2">to do and I was happy for her it was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">right move it was like it was of her own</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.070" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">volition like everything about it was as</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:53.490" style="s2">right as it could ever hope for for for</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">somebody that you love you know for them</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.490" end="00:05:58.970" style="s2">to make a decision that&#39;s a joyful</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">decision of their own volition and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.970" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">and of sound mind and body and all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:06.680" style="s2">those things were true so there was no</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.060" end="00:06:10.410" style="s2">reason to be mournful except for</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.680" end="00:06:11.910" style="s2">attachment to that house and so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.410" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">remember going one last time to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.910" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">house and sort of saying my goodbyes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:19.020" style="s2">it you know it was always wafting with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:21.240" style="s2">like the most glorious aromas to because</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.020" end="00:06:22.890" style="s2">it was always cooking and like lying</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.240" end="00:06:25.070" style="s2">everywhere it was great it was just</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.890" end="00:06:28.110" style="s2">there was a wonderful place to be and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.070" end="00:06:30.060" style="s2">and then just recently in November I</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.110" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">went to visit her for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.060" end="00:06:37.260" style="s2">since she moved into her new apartment</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.930" end="00:06:39.630" style="s2">and I&#39;d seen the apartment in bare</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.260" end="00:06:40.920" style="s2">already so I knew where it is I knew</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.630" end="00:06:43.500" style="s2">where it was and I knew what it looked</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.920" end="00:06:46.950" style="s2">like bear i knew the size and the shape</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.500" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">and the orientation and all of that but</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.950" end="00:06:50.640" style="s2">i was a bit trepidatious but doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:52.500" style="s2">because i thought well this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.640" end="00:06:56.160" style="s2">time that i&#39;m going to be visiting my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.500" end="00:06:58.440" style="s2">grandmother not in that house and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.160" end="00:07:00.540" style="s2">was something there was something very</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.440" end="00:07:04.290" style="s2">melancholic to me about that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.540" end="00:07:07.940" style="s2">walk in to this much smaller apartment</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.290" end="00:07:10.770" style="s2">and lo and behold it&#39;s the house hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.940" end="00:07:14.130" style="s2">everything had been arranged and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.770" end="00:07:16.020" style="s2">configured in likeness to the house and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.130" end="00:07:18.120" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that everything was</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.020" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">necessarily in the same place because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.120" end="00:07:24.870" style="s2">can&#39;t because the dimensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:29.340" style="s2">spacer work considerably smaller but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.870" end="00:07:31.950" style="s2">somehow the character of the house was</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.340" end="00:07:36.060" style="s2">simply reproduced in a different space</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.950" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">and I was astonished I was astonished at</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.060" end="00:07:42.420" style="s2">how how seamless the transition was I</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">was astonished that it was the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.420" end="00:07:48.060" style="s2">place wasn&#39;t the same space but it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:50.220" style="s2">the same place the logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.060" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">apartment was the same logos as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.220" end="00:07:55.070" style="s2">house I can put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">it was cohered in the same manner it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.070" end="00:08:03.150" style="s2">inflicted with the same voice it was her</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:06.360" style="s2">just as the house had been and I felt as</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.150" end="00:08:08.700" style="s2">embraced by it it was as vow to me as</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.360" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">the house had been simply in miniature</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.700" end="00:08:14.430" style="s2">and that was a very profound experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:16.500" style="s2">for me too to see that such a thing was</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.430" end="00:08:18.480" style="s2">really possible yes anyway sorry that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.500" end="00:08:22.410" style="s2">was that was a bit rambling of me but I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.480" end="00:08:24.600" style="s2">couldn&#39;t help but to identify with with</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.410" end="00:08:27.000" style="s2">what you said there Nick I thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.600" end="00:08:30.510" style="s2">that&#39;s a cool little synchronicity from</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.000" end="00:08:33.290" style="s2">me yeah I think the thing I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.510" end="00:08:38.070" style="s2">highlighted there for me is like we said</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.290" end="00:08:41.910" style="s2">it&#39;s numinous right and that yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.070" end="00:08:46.140" style="s2">scent what I take in it mr. B is when</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">when I when what salient is so well</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.140" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">beyond what I can actually visually see</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:57.079" style="s2">your taste object somehow reveals the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:09:00.860" style="s2">ah stable right in it it&#39;s tone us in</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.079" end="00:09:06.380" style="s2">its particularity right when it emanates</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.860" end="00:09:08.930" style="s2">like that right in it I&#39;ll remember when</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.380" end="00:09:14.389" style="s2">I went back to Hinsdale one time I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.930" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">I in my early early years and I so I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.389" end="00:09:18.440" style="s2">I spent most of the time in downtown</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:20.660" style="s2">Hinsdale when I was you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.440" end="00:09:23.660" style="s2">four through maybe eight or something</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.660" end="00:09:26.660" style="s2">like that and it was kind of right</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.660" end="00:09:30.829" style="s2">around the time where I was not learning</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.660" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">how to read and when I got back there</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.829" end="00:09:37.550" style="s2">and I was sitting at a for I think like</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.110" style="s2">a like a family reunion or something</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.550" end="00:09:41.269" style="s2">like that and I just I was sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.110" end="00:09:44.380" style="s2">the corner of a Starbucks and drinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.269" end="00:09:48.350" style="s2">coffee and I I looked up at the sign and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.380" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">and the sign had been there since I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.350" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">a kid and I looked up at it and I just I</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:59.899" style="s2">saw it and it was this this orange this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:03.860" style="s2">is like a you know a very simple like</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.899" end="00:10:06.140" style="s2">outline drawing flat you know a flat</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.860" end="00:10:08.209" style="s2">image and the shape coming in and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.140" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">thing kind of eating the shape and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.209" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">I just and then all of a sudden I looked</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:18.920" style="s2">and it switched I realized oh no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">an eagle going through a movie and I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.920" end="00:10:25.070" style="s2">like it I&#39;m not cool and I looked up and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:27.010" style="s2">then all of these all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.070" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">were left when I was a kid almost what</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.010" end="00:10:35.690" style="s2">pop pop they popped right and I because</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.690" end="00:10:40.550" style="s2">was a kid and it&#39;s it because the way I</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.630" end="00:10:41.990" style="s2">would see it kid it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.550" end="00:10:43.940" style="s2">hard to describe but I always saw that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.990" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">thing I just was kind of this monster</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.940" end="00:10:48.440" style="s2">thing they kind of went like this it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.410" style="s2">unquestioned by me because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:53.269" style="s2">see but then it switched and I was able</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.410" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">to see that and it just went the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.269" end="00:10:58.839" style="s2">neighborhood what did you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:11:04.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something about I think</p>

<p begin="00:11:22.009" end="00:11:27.139" style="s2">respect and especially the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.889" end="00:11:31.670" style="s2">respect of when you think about you know</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.089" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2">presence of something greater holding me</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.009" end="00:12:03.620" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like it&#39;s that you right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:05.920" style="s2">not not necessarily like a face taught</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.620" end="00:12:09.379" style="s2">in a conversation but it&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.920" end="00:12:12.829" style="s2">now relationship it is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.379" end="00:12:15.110" style="s2">holding it&#39;s cradling it&#39;s a cradling I</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.829" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">there&#39;s even a quote I think I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.110" end="00:12:19.069" style="s2">remember whose is it Ponte or her Cyril</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:23.629" style="s2">but one of them said that something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.069" end="00:12:26.449" style="s2">that the world is our birthplace because</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.629" end="00:12:28.790" style="s2">we are cradled by it but our but but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.449" end="00:12:31.879" style="s2">our minds are also cradle for the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.790" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">right there&#39;s a mutual cradling and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.879" end="00:12:39.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that that&#39;s very very much what</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:43.189" style="s2">it makes me think of yeah also also Nick</p>

<p begin="00:12:43.189" end="00:12:48.379" style="s2">first four-way conversation it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.620" end="00:12:48.939" style="s2">really great it was a model oh right</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.790" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">ideas that he had especially one that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.439" end="00:12:59.720" style="s2">really stuck with me that was when he</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:01.809" style="s2">said it seemed like the virtue what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.720" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">were all doing was lifting each other up</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.809" end="00:13:09.230" style="s2">right like that was the virtue so like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:11.449" style="s2">the like each play off each other and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.230" end="00:13:14.629" style="s2">the job was like we were we wouldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.449" end="00:13:16.370" style="s2">up until everyone went up like and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.629" end="00:13:18.199" style="s2">that when you got to the top by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.370" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">of being at the top meant everyone was</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.199" end="00:13:22.490" style="s2">looking top</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:25.190" style="s2">in distinguishing that part of it that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.490" end="00:13:28.210" style="s2">in here I thought was really beautiful</p>

<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:26.419" style="s2">physically and that ties in very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:29.330" style="s2">aptly with all like the abundance of</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.179" end="00:18:01.950" style="s2">together you come up with a sort of</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.950" end="00:18:07.159" style="s2">very powerful oh the idea that we end</p>

<p begin="00:18:07.159" end="00:18:11.279" style="s2">atmosphere of meaningfulness and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:13.309" style="s2">our relationship to the atmosphere of</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.279" end="00:18:15.210" style="s2">meaningfulness is a kind of respiratory</p>

<p begin="00:18:17.759" end="00:18:28.019" style="s2">it also connotes the the the the the the</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.480" end="00:19:04.379" style="s2">picks up on yeah up so looking look yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.169" end="00:19:06.149" style="s2">I look I mean just phenomenal just the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.379" end="00:19:08.429" style="s2">whole project phenomenology do you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.149" end="00:19:13.559" style="s2">about it I just I don&#39;t think I seen</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.629" end="00:19:53.909" style="s2">think that&#39;s a common experience or</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.570" end="00:19:55.499" style="s2">arpeggio very symbolic language etc but</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.909" end="00:19:57.059" style="s2">I find myself letting go of that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.499" end="00:19:58.919" style="s2">really trying to feel the content of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.059" end="00:20:00.929" style="s2">conversation the way described in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.919" end="00:20:02.549" style="s2">video I&#39;ve often worried that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.929" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">getting the proper meaning from things</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.549" end="00:20:05.999" style="s2">because of this but hearing you guys</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.200" end="00:20:08.460" style="s2">also think and understanding that way is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.999" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">very reassuring keep up the great work</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.460" end="00:20:14.609" style="s2">you&#39;re changing the game thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:16.379" style="s2">that thank you for that and yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.609" end="00:20:20.070" style="s2">really is true it&#39;s certainly true for</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.379" end="00:20:23.279" style="s2">me that that&#39;s very very much the way I</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.070" end="00:20:26.249" style="s2">also read and listen certain things if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.279" end="00:20:28.830" style="s2">think that that a certain term might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.249" end="00:20:30.119" style="s2">really focal for an argument or an idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.830" end="00:20:33.779" style="s2">that maybe I&#39;ll dwell on it for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.119" end="00:20:35.489" style="s2">but generally the the poetic flow of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.779" end="00:20:39.330" style="s2">conversation or an argument will</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.489" end="00:20:42.419" style="s2">intimate its significance more than the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.330" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">individual instances of semantic content</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.419" end="00:20:48.210" style="s2">in any given sentence or phrase and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.730" style="s2">following the cadence and the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.210" end="00:20:53.580" style="s2">that that over signified</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.730" end="00:20:57.809" style="s2">meaning I find is much more predictive</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.580" end="00:21:00.960" style="s2">of the significance and ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.809" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">direction of the conversation then then</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:07.049" style="s2">stopping to preoccupy with with any one</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.090" style="s2">phrase or term you know with some</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.049" end="00:21:11.159" style="s2">exceptions but I generally find that to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.090" end="00:21:13.519" style="s2">be true and that sense of holding</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.159" end="00:21:18.450" style="s2">something that is you don&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.519" end="00:21:22.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s a context that is revealing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.450" end="00:21:25.049" style="s2">it and holding that kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.639" end="00:21:28.590" style="s2">ambivalence of understanding around it</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.049" end="00:21:30.690" style="s2">and that concept comes up again in</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.590" end="00:21:33.210" style="s2">another yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.690" end="00:21:36.539" style="s2">around it you circle around it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.210" end="00:21:39.419" style="s2">is there&#39;s something very tied I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.539" end="00:21:41.429" style="s2">to how we acquire language right because</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.419" end="00:21:42.600" style="s2">because if you look at if you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.429" end="00:21:44.879" style="s2">epistemologically</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.600" end="00:21:47.279" style="s2">how the hell does the chat learn its</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.879" end="00:21:49.230" style="s2">first word without knowing other words</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.279" end="00:21:52.109" style="s2">by which to work understand that word</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.230" end="00:21:54.989" style="s2">there&#39;s a mimicry like something much</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.109" end="00:21:57.929" style="s2">deeper than epistemology it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.989" end="00:22:00.119" style="s2">ontological so kind of I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.929" end="00:22:04.499" style="s2">that sense of where a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.119" end="00:22:06.779" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about presupposes</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.499" end="00:22:08.909" style="s2">that you understand what we&#39;re like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.779" end="00:22:12.760" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about in order to talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.909" end="00:22:15.820" style="s2">about it yeah so complex</p>

<p begin="00:25:16.249" end="00:25:20.929" style="s2">kind of sense of that like what happens</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.979" end="00:25:41.659" style="s2">the Gunter is talking about I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.779" end="00:25:43.969" style="s2">yeah and and you know that I also have</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.659" end="00:25:45.889" style="s2">this sense sometimes in the throw is</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.969" end="00:25:52.459" style="s2">even of a conversation or even listening</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.889" end="00:25:54.879" style="s2">to one where I I experience the meanings</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.879" end="00:26:02.029" style="s2">almost sometimes experience them in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.799" end="00:26:04.039" style="s2">more eidetic way than a linguistic way</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.029" end="00:26:06.529" style="s2">right that the content the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.039" end="00:26:09.079" style="s2">the way that they intimate and connote</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.529" end="00:26:11.629" style="s2">let&#39;s say a particular argument or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.079" end="00:26:14.629" style="s2">particular phrase sometimes they&#39;re they</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.189" end="00:26:27.289" style="s2">there&#39;s something like there&#39;s a man I</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.319" end="00:26:29.029" style="s2">don&#39;t and I don&#39;t mm-hmm if this it gets</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.289" end="00:26:30.499" style="s2">tricky now right we&#39;re in or to a level</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.029" end="00:26:32.389" style="s2">of abstraction that becomes tricky but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.499" end="00:26:34.249" style="s2">don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t mean image it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.389" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">necessarily in the literal sense but</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.249" end="00:26:39.740" style="s2">certainly the non linguistic sense of</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.740" end="00:26:44.840" style="s2">that has value beyond its propositional</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.990" end="00:26:48.440" style="s2">content and so the rhythms of a</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.839" end="00:39:43.309" style="s2">because you can&#39;t like you can you can</p>

<p begin="00:39:45.980" end="00:39:49.430" style="s2">fairly quickly right you can know all</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.430" end="00:39:55.020" style="s2">somebody fairly quickly like a few a few</p>

<p begin="00:39:55.020" end="00:39:58.980" style="s2">you know a few days is all it would take</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.150" end="00:40:01.260" style="s2">to know all of the relevant facts you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.980" end="00:40:02.970" style="s2">will details about a person but of</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.260" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">course as we all know implicitly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.970" end="00:40:08.490" style="s2">not particularly revealing out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:11.160" style="s2">context and what the context is is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.490" end="00:40:13.580" style="s2">shared revealing conformity of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.160" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">relationship that then beckons to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.580" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">something that is that something</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:22.530" style="s2">combinative between the two people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:25.530" style="s2">then becomes inexhaustible and so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.530" end="00:40:29.580" style="s2">ritual of unconcealed one another the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.530" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">ritual of developing intimacy the ritual</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.580" end="00:40:33.630" style="s2">of coming to know someone is not a</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:35.340" style="s2">ritual that we have very well mapped</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.630" end="00:40:37.920" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.340" end="00:40:41.700" style="s2">even for friendship we don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.920" end="00:40:43.320" style="s2">it very well mapped and perhaps in part</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.700" end="00:40:50.450" style="s2">that&#39;s because our sociability is no</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.320" end="00:40:53.670" style="s2">longer governed by by by by reliable and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.450" end="00:40:55.170" style="s2">observed customs in the way that it once</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.670" end="00:40:58.380" style="s2">was and I don&#39;t mean to be too romantic</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.170" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">about the past obviously but but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.380" end="00:41:03.150" style="s2">something about the hastening to</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:04.950" style="s2">intimacy that is precisely antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.150" end="00:41:08.430" style="s2">to intimacy intimacy is not something</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.950" end="00:41:10.740" style="s2">that you can hasten to knowledge of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.430" end="00:41:12.570" style="s2">person is not an or gnosis of a person</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.740" end="00:41:14.940" style="s2">is not to be more specific is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.570" end="00:41:18.170" style="s2">something that you can hasten to and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.940" end="00:41:21.090" style="s2">think in order to make it in order to</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.170" end="00:41:22.680" style="s2">cultivate it it has to somehow be</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.090" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">ritualized and I think that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.680" end="00:41:28.230" style="s2">dialogic praxis comes into play the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:36.030" style="s2">dialogic praxis is a way of ritualizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.230" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">the intimate gnosis of a person and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.030" end="00:41:39.930" style="s2">and and so the hastening of that process</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:42.360" style="s2">makes me it makes me think of the Hans</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.930" end="00:41:44.700" style="s2">Hans observations about time again right</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.360" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">the whizzing the whizzing the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.700" end="00:41:48.630" style="s2">lingering is something that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:50.820" style="s2">sociability just as it happens to any</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.630" end="00:41:52.950" style="s2">other kind of exercise and so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.820" end="00:41:57.420" style="s2">empathized I empathize with this the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.950" end="00:42:00.900" style="s2">frustration of that of being of being of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.420" end="00:42:03.750" style="s2">being treated as sort of something to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.900" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">to be to be unboxed God there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.750" end="00:42:07.710" style="s2">strange phenomenon with unboxing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:08.730" style="s2">going on now maybe that has something to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.710" end="00:42:11.280" style="s2">do with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.730" end="00:42:17.640" style="s2">and because obviously we just don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.280" end="00:42:19.700" style="s2">that way I really I just also just</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.640" end="00:42:24.630" style="s2">really appreciate when he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.700" end="00:42:26.310" style="s2">and you talked about the beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.630" end="00:42:28.050" style="s2">know somebody and tending to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.310" end="00:42:30.450" style="s2">relationship that there&#39;s a placing</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.050" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">weight to the revealing and in the wreck</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.450" end="00:42:35.910" style="s2">like that we used to have rituals like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:40.440" style="s2">courtship the notion of course the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.910" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">courtship interesting you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.440" end="00:42:49.500" style="s2">lifetime I grew up with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:51.150" style="s2">general sense that I&#39;d lived my life and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.500" end="00:42:54.660" style="s2">somewhere along the way I would meet the</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.150" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">person right that that I would marry in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.660" end="00:42:59.579" style="s2">the living of my life and there was just</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">kind of the background it was in in in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.579" end="00:43:04.530" style="s2">some way to the fabric of the rituals of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:08.119" style="s2">all my social practices in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.530" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">and all that and very very recently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.119" end="00:43:14.700" style="s2">stunning how much of a dramatic changes</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.130" end="00:43:17.130" style="s2">is and how no one&#39;s have normalized it</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.700" end="00:43:19.829" style="s2">got so quickly but it is a dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.130" end="00:43:25.950" style="s2">thing you know this thing is that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.829" end="00:43:28.410" style="s2">think it&#39;s become in the assumptive</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.950" end="00:43:30.270" style="s2">background that you probably won&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.410" end="00:43:32.069" style="s2">the person that you out in your life</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.270" end="00:43:36.030" style="s2">that you&#39;re gonna marry you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.069" end="00:43:37.530" style="s2">it to a dating website which is when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.030" end="00:43:38.760" style="s2">think about it that&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.530" end="00:43:42.740" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.760" end="00:43:45.900" style="s2">you show up already sizing each other up</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.740" end="00:43:51.060" style="s2">right one of the things I&#39;ve noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.900" end="00:43:53.220" style="s2">that this there&#39;s a certain look you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.060" end="00:43:56.099" style="s2">know having your profile I guess is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.220" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">whole thing and matching them up and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.099" end="00:44:03.810" style="s2">like looking at the person as a set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:06.780" style="s2">basically quantities right that you show</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.810" end="00:44:10.470" style="s2">up already sizing each other up for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.780" end="00:44:13.770" style="s2">and so you kind of rehearse the person</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.470" end="00:44:16.380" style="s2">to this that and the other thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.770" end="00:44:17.940" style="s2">already kind of set up in advance on one</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.380" end="00:44:20.550" style="s2">level they&#39;re kind of cool about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.940" end="00:44:21.900" style="s2">right like let&#39;s get to it we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.550" end="00:44:23.820" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do it the bar any</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.900" end="00:44:30.630" style="s2">you&#39;re doing that anyway but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.820" end="00:44:34.950" style="s2">way right all of the ride of getting to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.630" end="00:44:39.600" style="s2">know somebody including that withheld</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.950" end="00:44:41.640" style="s2">sense of like does she like me do I say</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.600" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">at first or you say first everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.640" end="00:44:51.810" style="s2">right all of that emerging all of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">sudden boom all that&#39;s optimized of you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.810" end="00:44:57.000" style="s2">yes you know I think big last thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:59.130" style="s2">in right yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.000" end="00:45:02.820" style="s2">imagine I could just imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.130" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">sensibility yes that is probably I could</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.820" end="00:45:09.270" style="s2">just see it I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:14.030" style="s2">it seems like the very same sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.270" end="00:45:16.980" style="s2">of how you go about mm-hmm sar</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.030" end="00:45:19.740" style="s2">apparently yeah really talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.980" end="00:45:22.170" style="s2">that but that&#39;s a traumatic change this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.740" end="00:45:23.910" style="s2">is man this is a conversation topic unto</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.170" end="00:45:25.830" style="s2">itself that maybe we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.910" end="00:45:29.930" style="s2">have at some point because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.830" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">very rich and it&#39;s bizarre and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.930" end="00:45:34.580" style="s2">I mean one thing that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:37.590" style="s2">about what you&#39;re saying I the coming</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.900" end="00:45:43.590" style="s2">for the first time versus having to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.850" end="00:45:46.230" style="s2">negotiate it because one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.590" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">like something like online dating does</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.230" end="00:45:51.390" style="s2">is it pre fits you with context you</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.520" end="00:51:21.940" style="s2">experience there&#39;s so much recollection</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.140" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">that happens because you just well we</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.940" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">before before we started recording we</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:28.840" style="s2">were talking about this we were talking</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.330" end="00:51:40.840" style="s2">and the Platonic sense and so I find a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.340" end="00:51:42.609" style="s2">lot of that that&#39;s why there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.840" end="00:51:44.560" style="s2">alacrity in those conversations because</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.609" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh my god yes there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.690" end="00:56:09.710" style="s2">by participation is in some sense to be</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.770" end="00:56:30.200" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and then and then I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.890" end="00:56:32.540" style="s2">that was obviously the implicit the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.200" end="00:56:36.800" style="s2">implicit eros within the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.540" end="00:56:38.810" style="s2">structure of that observation then makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.800" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">me think of the the ontological flesh</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.810" end="00:56:42.230" style="s2">again a little bit right and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:43.880" style="s2">think what he describes what Ponte</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.230" end="00:56:46.190" style="s2">describes as the reversibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.880" end="00:56:51.560" style="s2">ontological flesh right as a relation</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.190" end="00:56:53.990" style="s2">between bodies and that it also makes me</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.560" end="00:56:57.470" style="s2">think then about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.990" end="00:56:59.150" style="s2">dialogue so when one thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.470" end="00:57:00.950" style="s2">some of the phenomenologist stalk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.150" end="00:57:03.230" style="s2">is the dialogue between subject and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.950" end="00:57:05.240" style="s2">object and and what we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.230" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">about all the while is that the dialogo</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.240" end="00:57:13.970" style="s2">s-- has a character of gathering</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:17.869" style="s2">intimacy that is absent</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.970" end="00:57:20.540" style="s2">oftentimes in regular discourse regular</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.869" end="00:57:22.520" style="s2">dialogue and so it seems to me we were</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.540" end="00:57:26.900" style="s2">to be so we&#39;ve been talking about the D</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.520" end="00:57:29.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about transmuting the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.900" end="00:57:32.810" style="s2">axis of inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.090" end="00:57:35.000" style="s2">diello goes to ontological diet to a</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.810" end="00:57:36.800" style="s2">dialogic knowing that is not that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.000" end="00:57:38.210" style="s2">ontological nature right the dying of</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.800" end="00:57:39.830" style="s2">the world that&#39;s what we started by</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.210" end="00:57:53.180" style="s2">talking about and so in some sense I</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.830" end="00:57:55.730" style="s2">wonder if the like that the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.180" end="00:57:59.210" style="s2">that rat that sense of radical realism</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.730" end="00:58:04.340" style="s2">in the dialogic process the shared flesh</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.210" end="00:58:14.440" style="s2">of logos between between selves is then</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.340" end="00:58:18.290" style="s2">a way of almost alkalizing the what or</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.440" end="00:58:20.840" style="s2">consummating the flesh between i and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.290" end="00:58:22.490" style="s2">vow of the world right that the espousal</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.840" end="00:58:25.070" style="s2">of shared identity by symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.490" end="00:58:27.680" style="s2">participation we&#39;re in sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.070" end="00:58:30.550" style="s2">flesh the it relation of the subject to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.680" end="00:58:33.170" style="s2">object perceptual dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.550" end="00:58:34.730" style="s2">recharacterized by the intimating flesh</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.170" end="00:58:37.340" style="s2">of the subject to subject the logos</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.730" end="00:58:39.740" style="s2">which is thou it has the character of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.340" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">thou and so then in that exercise that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.740" end="00:58:47.480" style="s2">sort of philosophy of ambiguity resolves</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:52.670" style="s2">into a like a worldly animation right</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.480" end="00:58:54.650" style="s2">everything becomes Rhian chanted like</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.670" end="00:58:57.170" style="s2">the anima Mundi right there like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.650" end="00:58:59.690" style="s2">world the idea of the world soul that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.170" end="00:59:03.590" style="s2">that the world soul is consummated by</p>

<p begin="00:59:13.440" end="00:59:20.910" style="s2">down to the way that ancient or</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.890" end="00:59:23.610" style="s2">something in the background in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.910" end="00:59:27.780" style="s2">foreground in a certain way you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.610" end="00:59:30.810" style="s2">when you bring your attention to some</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.780" end="00:59:33.480" style="s2">some part of the world and you give it</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.810" end="00:59:35.640" style="s2">like you give it do a tuned attention</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.480" end="00:59:37.980" style="s2">and it starts to reveal itself through</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.640" end="00:59:40.440" style="s2">the distinctions right in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.980" end="00:59:43.260" style="s2">sense is that kind of erotic</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.440" end="00:59:46.530" style="s2">relationship with the world where you</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.260" end="00:59:48.270" style="s2">know just like symbolically you know you</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.530" end="00:59:50.130" style="s2">could say that you say like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.270" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">masculine is something like the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.130" end="00:59:57.830" style="s2">unchanging forever</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="01:00:00.570" style="s2">open consciousness for which the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.830" end="01:00:02.940" style="s2">animates right and if that if the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.570" end="01:00:05.190" style="s2">consciousness is dimmed right that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.940" end="01:00:07.410" style="s2">glow of the world is going to dim it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.190" end="01:00:09.750" style="s2">one-to-one relationship so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.410" end="01:00:11.570" style="s2">quality of like thinking about the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.750" end="01:00:13.890" style="s2">is certain there is a very erotic</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.570" end="01:00:17.010" style="s2">relationship to it and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.890" end="01:00:18.780" style="s2">why distinctions are so especially when</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.010" end="01:00:20.520" style="s2">they&#39;re first made or they&#39;re first</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.780" end="01:00:22.260" style="s2">developed right because they have this</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.520" end="01:00:24.150" style="s2">process of like you make a distinction</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.260" end="01:00:25.860" style="s2">just like when you&#39;re drinking wine you</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.150" end="01:00:28.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to drink wine right it</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.860" end="01:00:30.840" style="s2">just it&#39;s grape juice it burns its</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.590" end="01:00:33.510" style="s2">unsweet like why bother</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.840" end="01:00:36.620" style="s2">but like somebody really is cultivated</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.510" end="01:00:39.120" style="s2">and you start to oh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.620" end="01:00:42.420" style="s2">appreciation the appreciation process</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.120" end="01:00:44.010" style="s2">it&#39;s very that is a mutual thing where</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.420" end="01:00:46.050" style="s2">it&#39;s like you make the distinction or</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.010" end="01:00:48.210" style="s2">you get the distinction and all of a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.050" end="01:00:50.640" style="s2">sudden there&#39;s a difference between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.210" end="01:00:53.430" style="s2">beginning like of when you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.640" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">smelling it right and the start and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.430" end="01:00:57.540" style="s2">finish in it once you have those</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:01:00.120" style="s2">distinctions and then you can it</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.540" end="01:01:02.490" style="s2">literally brings the world into</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.120" end="01:01:04.650" style="s2">existence on some level right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.490" end="01:01:06.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a and there&#39;s an elation that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.650" end="01:01:09.870" style="s2">comes with that that I think is very</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.530" end="01:01:12.660" style="s2">it&#39;s about that that thing that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.870" end="01:01:15.270" style="s2">Mary&#39;s getting at right this mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.660" end="01:01:19.290" style="s2">this kind of focusing consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.270" end="01:01:21.029" style="s2">then the world revealing itself you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.290" end="01:01:24.569" style="s2">feed back on that consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.029" end="01:01:27.659" style="s2">right and inspiring it to go further and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.569" end="01:01:31.189" style="s2">also inspiring her to animate even more</p>

<p begin="01:03:04.859" end="01:03:13.799" style="s2">this earlier in our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.699" end="01:03:15.679" style="s2">there&#39;s ability to grappling with things</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.799" end="01:03:18.949" style="s2">that aren&#39;t immediately intelligible</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.679" end="01:03:23.159" style="s2">mmm-hmm sometimes for a long time right</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.949" end="01:03:25.319" style="s2">that is I oh my like so much of what I</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.159" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">call would in my life is about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.319" end="01:03:29.309" style="s2">sense of dwelling and struggling</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:32.579" style="s2">something living with it</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.309" end="01:03:34.250" style="s2">right and it not being so linear and</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.579" end="01:03:35.750" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.250" end="01:03:37.940" style="s2">Acrobat so you&#39;re trying to do in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.750" end="01:03:40.670" style="s2">frustrations and then the insights and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.940" end="01:03:45.980" style="s2">then they slip away that whole process</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.670" end="01:03:49.430" style="s2">of being dwelling in this conversation I</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.980" end="01:03:53.180" style="s2">think in some ways is that is the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.430" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">point that&#39;s the practice point of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.180" end="01:04:02.060" style="s2">right and it&#39;s very it&#39;s very it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:04:05.300" style="s2">sensibility to well write something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.060" end="01:04:08.660" style="s2">I think is becoming rare and rare right</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.300" end="01:04:11.630" style="s2">there it&#39;s such a sense of where if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.660" end="01:04:13.550" style="s2">if it&#39;s real it&#39;s it should be</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.630" end="01:04:16.190" style="s2">immediately there right it just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.550" end="01:04:19.490" style="s2">kind of instant optimization the</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.190" end="01:04:23.119" style="s2">standing reserve awaiting to be extract</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.490" end="01:04:27.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it is a resource right all of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.119" end="01:04:29.060" style="s2">sensibility is so deeply in our all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.170" end="01:04:31.400" style="s2">our social practices now I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.060" end="01:04:32.810" style="s2">what comes on is going on with what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.400" end="01:04:35.750" style="s2">were talking about with dating it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.810" end="01:04:38.300" style="s2">pervasive and we don&#39;t see it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.750" end="01:04:40.430" style="s2">so strange but we don&#39;t see it this</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.300" end="01:04:42.520" style="s2">sense of like struggling being puzzled</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:47.030" style="s2">by something like sticking with it like</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.520" end="01:04:49.580" style="s2">all of that is like I think to me is a</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.030" end="01:04:53.839" style="s2">restoration of something of a deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.580" end="01:04:56.359" style="s2">wisdom and humility of being with</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.839" end="01:04:58.930" style="s2">something and what I didn&#39;t like is what</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.359" end="01:05:03.050" style="s2">breeds something like character right</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.930" end="01:05:05.570" style="s2">mission and like dwelling and something</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.050" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">and reading things and tolerating and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.570" end="01:05:09.470" style="s2">not demanding would be things be</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:11.510" style="s2">immediately intelligible I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.470" end="01:05:16.580" style="s2">just to practice itself of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.510" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">whether or not you ever understand what</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.580" end="01:05:21.020" style="s2">you were grappling with the process of</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:24.200" style="s2">attempting to and living with that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.020" end="01:05:27.380" style="s2">process you walk away and you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.200" end="01:05:30.589" style="s2">machinery that that exercises right is</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.380" end="01:05:34.790" style="s2">in itself in some ways the point or the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.589" end="01:05:38.420" style="s2">benefit right very much absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.790" end="01:05:40.070" style="s2">absolutely absolutely yeah I think this</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.420" end="01:05:43.369" style="s2">entire process for me it&#39;s simply an</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.070" end="01:05:45.890" style="s2">exercise of living within a question and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.369" end="01:05:47.270" style="s2">and you can find your open end itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.890" end="01:05:51.450" style="s2">within an open-ended</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.270" end="01:05:52.290" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s this process to me in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.450" end="01:05:54.180" style="s2">nutshell</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.290" end="01:05:57.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s of course it&#39;s uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.180" end="01:06:01.380" style="s2">but by by necessity by deep necessity it</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.090" end="01:06:06.510" style="s2">is uncomfortable yes how about I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.380" end="01:06:08.580" style="s2">of I need to go alright should we try</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.510" end="01:06:10.530" style="s2">and should we try and do shoe eat should</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.580" end="01:06:11.610" style="s2">we just stop and pick it up at another</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.530" end="01:06:14.240" style="s2">time or should we just try and plow</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.610" end="01:06:14.240" style="s2">through what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.790" end="01:06:28.950" style="s2">okay go ahead guy sing stop you</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.130" end="01:06:31.440" style="s2">mentioned that there is a lot of online</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.950" end="01:06:33.600" style="s2">comments conversations around the bow</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.440" end="01:06:35.030" style="s2">structure of the world inspired I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.600" end="01:06:38.430" style="s2">by the previous discussion</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.030" end="01:06:39.930" style="s2">service-learning John tell me where</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.430" end="01:06:41.940" style="s2">those conversations have been taking</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.930" end="01:06:46.800" style="s2">place or did you mean the YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.940" end="01:06:55.110" style="s2">comments I&#39;d like to join impossible</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.800" end="01:06:56.760" style="s2">things also so I know the book the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.110" end="01:06:58.560" style="s2">second part of the question it was the</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.760" end="01:07:00.450" style="s2">book that you actually sent me guy which</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.560" end="01:07:03.270" style="s2">I got a lot out of him made great use of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.450" end="01:07:05.070" style="s2">which was Mark I think Rakowski I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.270" end="01:07:07.590" style="s2">his name is Mark or Kelsey&#39;s book on</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.070" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">high degree and Plato I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.590" end="01:07:10.320" style="s2">the title of it it might just be</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:11.910" style="s2">Heidegger in Plato or it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.320" end="01:07:13.770" style="s2">very straightforward like that anyway</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.910" end="01:07:17.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a really really good book it it</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.770" end="01:07:19.050" style="s2">really is baby we would not have time to</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.790" end="01:07:21.540" style="s2">go into it but it&#39;s a really excellent</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.050" end="01:07:23.850" style="s2">book on hydrous thinking and put those</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.540" end="01:07:25.260" style="s2">thinking and where they are concentric</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.850" end="01:07:26.820" style="s2">and where they&#39;re not and where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.260" end="01:07:28.500" style="s2">concentric perhaps even unbeknownst to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.820" end="01:07:30.210" style="s2">Heidegger was thinking was concentric</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.500" end="01:07:33.360" style="s2">with Plato&#39;s in ways that he may not</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.210" end="01:07:37.650" style="s2">have appreciated but but serves to</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.360" end="01:07:48.870" style="s2">serves to to inform his own work and</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.650" end="01:07:52.530" style="s2">then conversations I don&#39;t know of any</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.870" end="01:07:54.210" style="s2">other place that that we were</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.530" end="01:07:55.200" style="s2">referencing without structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.210" end="01:07:57.840" style="s2">world it&#39;s just been out of those</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:59.869" style="s2">conversations of the four of us and</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.380" end="01:08:28.909" style="s2">getting getting towards the university</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.500" end="01:08:30.739" style="s2">so yeah maybe well it will inverse the</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.909" end="01:08:32.389" style="s2">order next time yeah and just to sneak</p>

<p begin="01:08:36.020" end="01:08:40.909" style="s2">it a regular you know shoot for like</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.029" end="01:08:43.929" style="s2">once a week of starting from the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.909" end="01:08:46.819" style="s2">beginnings of the Socratic dialogues as</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.929" end="01:08:49.400" style="s2">spelled out in the original Platonic</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.819" end="01:08:51.230" style="s2">Academy apparently there&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.400" end="01:08:53.929" style="s2">they used to have you read the dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.230" end="01:08:57.889" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s iamblichus is order I</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.929" end="01:08:59.299" style="s2">think that&#39;s the one yeah so like we we</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.889" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">just had an idea what would it be cool</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.299" end="01:09:05.989" style="s2">just to get together and read them and</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:08.870" style="s2">then talk about them just ongoingly in</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.989" end="01:09:10.870" style="s2">that order and and one to discover what</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.870" end="01:09:13.609" style="s2">is the intelligibility of that order</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.870" end="01:09:16.190" style="s2">which I imagine we&#39;ll only know through</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.609" end="01:09:17.630" style="s2">the actual enactment of it and then like</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.190" end="01:09:19.639" style="s2">Chris and I could be kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.630" end="01:09:21.319" style="s2">the ones that show up to that every week</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.639" end="01:09:22.790" style="s2">but then we can bring other of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.319" end="01:09:26.089" style="s2">energon and different different people</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.790" end="01:09:27.949" style="s2">so kind of join us for who knows how to</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.089" end="01:09:33.920" style="s2">unfold I thought it would be just really</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.949" end="01:09:38.210" style="s2">an awesome opportunity to you dwell in</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.920" end="01:09:40.159" style="s2">that older sense of like of like over</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.210" end="01:09:42.350" style="s2">time watching not only under</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.159" end="01:09:46.359" style="s2">understanding of the content grow but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.350" end="01:09:48.889" style="s2">like noticing how it impacts who we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.359" end="01:09:52.699" style="s2">over a period of time and have that all</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.889" end="01:09:55.190" style="s2">be reflected in the process I&#39;m excited</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.699" end="01:09:57.710" style="s2">to do that do that with I am I&#39;m serious</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.190" end="01:10:00.110" style="s2">get up to just you know we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.710" end="01:10:03.139" style="s2">know to what I I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.110" end="01:10:04.820" style="s2">fantastic idea guy of yours and I and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.139" end="01:10:05.929" style="s2">can&#39;t wait to do it it also reminds me a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.820" end="01:10:08.120" style="s2">little bit I was gonna say this to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.929" end="01:10:10.730" style="s2">earlier it reminds the idea alone</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.120" end="01:10:13.620" style="s2">reminds me of something similar to what</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.730" end="01:10:16.380" style="s2">Sevilla is doing with Pierre sakes</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.620" end="01:10:17.340" style="s2">is doing sort of an ongoing study of zen</p>
