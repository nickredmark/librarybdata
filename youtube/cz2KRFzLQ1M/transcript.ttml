<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:08.000" style="s2">but I want to tell you a story now and</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.440" end="00:00:12.389" style="s2">it has these characters in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">this is a very important story and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.389" end="00:00:17.430" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Enuma Elish and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">Mesopotamian creation myth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.430" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">important for a bunch of reasons first</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:24.449" style="s2">of all it&#39;s the oldest written story we</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">know of but it&#39;s also a Middle Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.449" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">story and the whole all the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:35.880" style="s2">religions emerged out of the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a foundational story it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.880" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">story that sits at the bottom of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">culture now it has it has similarities</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">to the creation story in Genesis whether</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">the creation story in Genesis was</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">derived from it or whether there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">whole variety of similar stories</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:56.070" style="s2">floating around in the Middle East and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">at the same time that were variants of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.070" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">theme we don&#39;t really know but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">doesn&#39;t read I don&#39;t think it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">matters we don&#39;t know how old the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">is we know how old it is in its written</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">form it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">old in this written one maybe it&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:18.600" style="s2">thousand years old it&#39;s written for him</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">but probably not it&#39;s probably more like</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.600" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">five thousand years old but the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">is that a 5,000 year old story is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">that&#39;s written is way older than 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">years like we&#39;re used to being in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:33.509" style="s2">environment where there&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.310" style="s2">stories you know because we have books</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.509" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">and movies and all of these things but</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.310" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">you know in it&#39;s slower moving and more</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">archaic cultures especially ones that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:42.920" style="s2">are just just have an oral tradition</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a million stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.920" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">there&#39;s like 20 canonical stories and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">god only knows how old they are there</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">was evidence linguistic evidence I just</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">saw a study on this last week someone</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">sent it to me showing that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">fairy tales that the Grimm brothers</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:04.469" style="s2">gathered might be ten thousand years old</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t surprise me because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.469" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">the kind of depth that&#39;s in a good fairy</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">tale is so the depth is so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:15.340" style="s2">profundity is so deep that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:18.010" style="s2">there&#39;s no way that someone could have</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.340" end="00:02:20.110" style="s2">just conjured it up you know 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.010" end="00:02:21.959" style="s2">ago it&#39;s there&#39;s layers and layers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.110" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">layers of meaning and they&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.959" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">archetypal and religious in significance</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.250" style="s2">and a Hansel and Gretel story is a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.190" style="s2">example of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.250" end="00:02:31.930" style="s2">um and Sleeping Beauty is a good example</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.190" end="00:02:33.879" style="s2">about do a lot of the canonical fairy</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.930" end="00:02:35.590" style="s2">tales are they&#39;re very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.879" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">they pack a lot of meaning into a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.590" end="00:02:45.690" style="s2">short and do a very limited amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:47.739" style="s2">time so so it was great that this was</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.690" end="00:02:49.299" style="s2">unearthed and it was only unearthed in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.739" end="00:02:52.060" style="s2">the late 1800s so we haven&#39;t known about</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.299" end="00:02:54.430" style="s2">this story you know for a long long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.060" end="00:02:56.019" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it was a tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.430" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">exciting discovery on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.019" end="00:03:05.260" style="s2">people who who dug it up so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.239" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">tell you the story so the primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.260" end="00:03:14.290" style="s2">character in this story is a like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:16.120" style="s2">dragon mother named time at and time at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.290" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">you could think about her as half the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.120" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">dragon of chaos and half the destructive</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">creative feminine so she you could think</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">about her as what&#39;s sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:26.650" style="s2">border between what&#39;s a known known and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:28.750" style="s2">an unknown in unknown and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:34.599" style="s2">construed as the mother of all things</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.750" end="00:03:37.419" style="s2">now the mother of all things is like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.599" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">what was revealed when the towers came</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.419" end="00:03:43.329" style="s2">down it&#39;s this tremendously complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.609" style="s2">background multi-level system of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.329" end="00:03:49.389" style="s2">operations that&#39;s always going on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.609" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">that identifiable singular things emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.389" end="00:03:54.760" style="s2">from now the Mesopotamians wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:56.919" style="s2">said that because what they said was</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.760" end="00:03:59.620" style="s2">this story because that&#39;s the form in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.919" end="00:04:00.849" style="s2">which their knowledge it had developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.620" end="00:04:02.919" style="s2">to the point where they could tell a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.849" end="00:04:04.569" style="s2">story about it instead of maybe acting</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.919" end="00:04:06.489" style="s2">it out or dreaming about it in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.569" end="00:04:08.139" style="s2">sense you know but they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.489" end="00:04:10.870" style="s2">articulate it we can barely articulate</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.139" end="00:04:13.510" style="s2">it now so there&#39;s time out she&#39;s viewed</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.870" end="00:04:16.090" style="s2">as the mother of all things and she has</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.510" end="00:04:18.010" style="s2">a husband named app sue who&#39;s her</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.090" end="00:04:20.049" style="s2">concert very little is said about app</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.010" end="00:04:21.340" style="s2">sue in this particular story and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.049" end="00:04:23.500" style="s2">the reason for that although I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.340" end="00:04:24.850" style="s2">sure of this is that the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.500" end="00:04:28.660" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:30.790" style="s2">was knew enough as a technological state</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.660" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">let&#39;s say because it they made cities as</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.790" end="00:04:36.070" style="s2">a technological state that the meant</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">that myths of humanity hadn&#39;t figured</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.070" end="00:04:45.820" style="s2">out how to encapsulate the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:47.770" style="s2">of a technological dominance heart there</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.820" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">was a sense that it existed but there</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.770" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a sense of it as a care of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:52.390" style="s2">differentiated character that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">capable of doing all sorts of different</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.390" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">things I think that didn&#39;t emerge till</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:05:00.190" style="s2">Egypt although I&#39;m not certain that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:03.130" style="s2">that&#39;s how it looks to me so absolute is</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.190" end="00:05:04.780" style="s2">her husband now the way the mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.130" end="00:05:06.790" style="s2">started the world and this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.780" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">way that the people who wrote Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.790" end="00:05:10.870" style="s2">thought of the world they thought of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:11.980" style="s2">that the world was a disk you know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.870" end="00:05:13.450" style="s2">what the world&#39;s like when you go</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.980" end="00:05:14.950" style="s2">outside and you stand in a field it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.450" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">flat field you look at the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.950" end="00:05:18.940" style="s2">pretty obvious what it is it&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:20.950" style="s2">disk of Earth and then there&#39;s a dome on</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.940" end="00:05:23.230" style="s2">top of it and in the dome art of the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.950" end="00:05:24.550" style="s2">and the moon and the stars and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.230" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">might ask well what&#39;s underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.550" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">earth and the answer for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:30.910" style="s2">Mesopotamians was fresh water first and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:32.770" style="s2">then saltwater how did you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.910" end="00:05:34.180" style="s2">well if you drilled down then nah the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.770" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">fresh water would come so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.180" end="00:05:36.850" style="s2">there was fresh water down there and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:38.770" style="s2">then if you went to the edge of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.850" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">territory it&#39;s like well there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.770" end="00:05:46.230" style="s2">salt water so the earth was you know let</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">the earth roughly speaking was a disk of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.230" end="00:05:51.610" style="s2">matter resting on a disk of fresh water</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">resting on a disk of salt water an</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.610" end="00:05:59.110" style="s2">absolute time that were the fresh and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:03.250" style="s2">saltwater respect okay and there now the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.110" end="00:06:05.770" style="s2">Mesopotamians thought that the way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.250" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">the that absolute time that gave birth</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.770" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">to everything was that they joined</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:12.040" style="s2">together in sexual union it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:14.620" style="s2">yin in the egg and it&#39;s very much like</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.040" end="00:06:17.710" style="s2">that exact and that it was out of their</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.620" end="00:06:19.960" style="s2">union that the the elemental gods</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.710" end="00:06:22.930" style="s2">emerged and I think you could think of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.960" end="00:06:25.450" style="s2">the elemental gods as their their their</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.930" end="00:06:29.020" style="s2">forces of nature and they&#39;re viewed</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.450" end="00:06:30.910" style="s2">through their not personified because to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.020" end="00:06:32.710" style="s2">personify something means that you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.910" end="00:06:35.200" style="s2">it as an objective phenomena and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.710" end="00:06:36.940" style="s2">attribute human characteristics to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.200" end="00:06:37.740" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t how people work what</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.940" end="00:06:40.259" style="s2">happens is we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.740" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">perceive human characteristics and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.259" end="00:06:46.289" style="s2">only with terrible effort do we extract</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">out the objective reality from them so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.289" end="00:06:51.180" style="s2">we D personalize things when we become</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">scientific but we just naturally see</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.180" end="00:06:55.080" style="s2">them as characters and you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.340" end="00:06:57.900" style="s2">when you read books to kids you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.080" end="00:06:59.550" style="s2">like everything&#39;s a personal train is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.900" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">person and a car as a person</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.550" end="00:07:04.020" style="s2">the moon is a person and the Sun is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:06.360" style="s2">person and you know you read stories to</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.020" end="00:07:07.949" style="s2">children that have that as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.360" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">presupposition doesn&#39;t bother you at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.949" end="00:07:11.400" style="s2">you know you can just fall right into it</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:13.259" style="s2">that&#39;s no problem you know and in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">animations you see the Sun in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.259" end="00:07:17.009" style="s2">smiling and bouncing along and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t bother you you know it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.009" end="00:07:20.520" style="s2">problem to look at the world that way</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.599" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s some utility in looking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.520" end="00:07:25.470" style="s2">the world in that way as we&#39;ll discover</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">so anyways and I think part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.470" end="00:07:28.470" style="s2">reason that we view things that way oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">yeah that was the other thing I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.470" end="00:07:34.220" style="s2">to tell you about our perceptual systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:36.990" style="s2">is that we we do have a social cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.220" end="00:07:39.180" style="s2">platform intellectual platform which</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.990" end="00:07:41.220" style="s2">means that our primary categories the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.180" end="00:07:44.430" style="s2">primary categories of our mind do seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.220" end="00:07:46.710" style="s2">to be social so you could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.430" end="00:07:49.139" style="s2">reason our mind evolved or no what you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.710" end="00:07:53.159" style="s2">could say that the fundamental selecting</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.139" end="00:07:57.060" style="s2">pressures on our on our mind ensured</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.159" end="00:08:00.389" style="s2">that the the primary substructure of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.060" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">cognitive ability was modules that could</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.389" end="00:08:05.820" style="s2">understand social behavior men can</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:07.590" style="s2">understand women women can understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.820" end="00:08:09.509" style="s2">men men and women could understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.590" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">children children men and women could</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.509" end="00:08:15.719" style="s2">understand the social world and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:18.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re specialized</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.719" end="00:08:20.729" style="s2">for and then it was only after those</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.210" end="00:08:23.099" style="s2">systems developed hyper develop probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.729" end="00:08:25.380" style="s2">under the under the force of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.099" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">selection that they became able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.380" end="00:08:29.099" style="s2">separate themselves to some degree from</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:31.169" style="s2">that underlying social cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.099" end="00:08:34.740" style="s2">structure and start to see the world in</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.169" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">ways that weren&#39;t personified so but</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.740" end="00:08:39.270" style="s2">what that means is that our natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:41.490" style="s2">categories are still and anthropomorphic</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.270" end="00:08:46.440" style="s2">and dramatic it actually turns out they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.490" end="00:08:49.079" style="s2">work so absolute time not nature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.440" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">culture is a perfectly reasonable way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.079" end="00:08:50.850" style="s2">thinking about them now they would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:53.070" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.850" end="00:08:55.740" style="s2">it&#39;s the interplay between nature and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.070" end="00:08:57.960" style="s2">culture that gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.740" end="00:09:00.120" style="s2">primordial forces of nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.960" end="00:09:02.250" style="s2">now those forces of nature would be to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.120" end="00:09:03.720" style="s2">some degree external like a storm or</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.250" end="00:09:06.510" style="s2">like fire but they would be sucked to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.720" end="00:09:08.970" style="s2">some degree internal - like like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.510" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">fire of passion right and that and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.970" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">storm of sorrow because those are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:16.620" style="s2">natural forces as well and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:20.010" style="s2">things that the ancients knew was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.620" end="00:09:21.810" style="s2">man was created to serve the gods and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.010" end="00:09:23.250" style="s2">course modern people think of that as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.810" end="00:09:24.630" style="s2">superstition but that&#39;s because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.250" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand how archaic</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.630" end="00:09:29.940" style="s2">people thought archaic people thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:32.190" style="s2">like Freud thought it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.940" end="00:09:34.200" style="s2">you have an ego fine you know and as</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.190" end="00:09:35.910" style="s2">long as you&#39;re in a box within a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.200" end="00:09:37.260" style="s2">of other blocks as the Eagle runs things</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.910" end="00:09:41.160" style="s2">but as soon as we put you somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.260" end="00:09:43.620" style="s2">where those boxes are gone it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.160" end="00:09:45.300" style="s2">underlying forces of nature that run you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.620" end="00:09:48.600" style="s2">hunger thirst</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.300" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">you know aggression sexuality and all</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.600" end="00:09:52.710" style="s2">those things that are impersonal because</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">of course you have them and you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.710" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">them and so does everyone else so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">they&#39;re impersonal and transcendent and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">they&#39;re also eternal and so when the art</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:04.200" style="s2">archaic people said and they usually</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.380" end="00:10:06.840" style="s2">said this with sorrow that man was</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.200" end="00:10:08.970" style="s2">destined to serve the gods that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.840" end="00:10:11.460" style="s2">they meant they meant that we were the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.970" end="00:10:13.800" style="s2">playthings of these unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:16.050" style="s2">powerful primordial forces that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.800" end="00:10:18.450" style="s2">manifested themselves within our lives</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.050" end="00:10:19.950" style="s2">and determined our destinies and in an</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.450" end="00:10:21.960" style="s2">in fact a Mesopotamian said that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.950" end="00:10:24.390" style="s2">specifically about the elder gods they</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.960" end="00:10:26.660" style="s2">said they were they they were part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.390" end="00:10:28.710" style="s2">that which determined human destiny</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.660" end="00:10:30.900" style="s2">Marduk who we&#39;ll talk about in a while</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.710" end="00:10:33.300" style="s2">was given the tablet of destinies</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.900" end="00:10:35.130" style="s2">because when he was when he asked to</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.300" end="00:10:37.380" style="s2">become top god he said well if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">be taught to determine the destinies and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.380" end="00:10:42.030" style="s2">well we&#39;ll get to that so you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:44.130" style="s2">got to know what these what these</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.030" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">archaic gods work and they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.130" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">personalities you know when you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">say well yeah yeah maybe it&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:55.140" style="s2">to attribute the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">personality to a storm although it</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.140" end="00:10:59.820" style="s2">depends on what you think a storm is</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">like a modern person would think of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.820" end="00:11:03.150" style="s2">storm as an objective event that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:05.220" style="s2">have subjective reactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.150" end="00:11:08.570" style="s2">- and our cam person would more likely</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.220" end="00:11:11.010" style="s2">think of the storm as the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.570" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">consequences of the storm plus the storm</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.010" end="00:11:15.660" style="s2">all at once they would make that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:17.010" style="s2">separation so it&#39;s a lot easier to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.660" end="00:11:19.110" style="s2">personify something under those</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.010" end="00:11:22.730" style="s2">conditions or to not to personify it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.110" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">- but to stay within the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.730" end="00:11:27.750" style="s2">conceptualization that makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:29.490" style="s2">personified force so the storm God is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.750" end="00:11:35.100" style="s2">something that you know that can instill</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.490" end="00:11:38.070" style="s2">terror into your heart yeah fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.100" end="00:11:40.710" style="s2">you know alright so anyways absolute</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.070" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">imap they give rise to these primordial</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.710" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">gods and I&#39;m going to think about them</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">as forces of nature and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:54.780" style="s2">reasonable representation for a variety</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:57.540" style="s2">of reasons they&#39;re like the Titans all</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.780" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">right so they give rise to these gods</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.540" end="00:12:02.400" style="s2">and the gods are their children and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:04.200" style="s2">run about making all sorts of racket</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.400" end="00:12:05.310" style="s2">they&#39;re making rockets and they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.200" end="00:12:06.630" style="s2">this and they&#39;re doing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.310" end="00:12:08.400" style="s2">building things and they&#39;re messing</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.630" end="00:12:10.680" style="s2">about with things and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.400" end="00:12:11.730" style="s2">noisily engaged in their interactions</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.680" end="00:12:13.470" style="s2">with one another and they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.730" end="00:12:15.330" style="s2">children and they&#39;re fighting about sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.470" end="00:12:18.540" style="s2">and they&#39;re just making racket like mad</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.330" end="00:12:20.010" style="s2">and then they do something stupid and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.540" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">they&#39;re annoying timeout as they make</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.010" end="00:12:25.680" style="s2">all this racket she&#39;s sort of slumbering</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:27.450" style="s2">down there in the depths leaving them be</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.680" end="00:12:29.280" style="s2">but they make all this racket and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.450" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">annoy her it&#39;s like it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.280" end="00:12:33.750" style="s2">environmentalist myth by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">exactly the same idea so you know human</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.750" end="00:12:38.190" style="s2">beings were kind of dopey we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">around gratifying our fundamental needs</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.190" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">and making racket and destroying things</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.070" end="00:12:54.300" style="s2">a mythological idea so fine they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:09.000" style="s2">a brilliant brilliant symbolic idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.440" end="00:13:09.810" style="s2">because what it means it means a bunch</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.810" end="00:13:14.910" style="s2">the things that means is that insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.999" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">the gods are because they&#39;re masculine</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.910" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the representation of</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:29.759" style="s2">the corpse of absolute is something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.309" end="00:13:32.550" style="s2">the idea that all of the natural forces</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.759" end="00:13:37.410" style="s2">that are embodied within human beings</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.550" end="00:13:40.620" style="s2">and driving them are resting on a sub</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.649" end="00:13:47.399" style="s2">at their culture and they think all that</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.129" end="00:13:56.819" style="s2">well if it&#39;s dead logically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.749" end="00:13:58.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not alive and if it&#39;s not alive it</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.680" end="00:14:02.910" style="s2">falls behind and gets full of errors and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.439" end="00:14:05.189" style="s2">it gets corrupt and starts to fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.910" end="00:14:07.559" style="s2">and if it gets corrupted full of errors</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.189" end="00:14:09.420" style="s2">and falls apart enough then chaos comes</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.559" end="00:14:11.970" style="s2">back that&#39;s exactly what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.420" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">Mesopotamian myth so they kill apps ooh</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.970" end="00:14:15.660" style="s2">and they keep making rocket and time at</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:18.389" style="s2">wakes up one day in space</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.660" end="00:14:20.699" style="s2">oh they&#39;re noisy I don&#39;t like them that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.389" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">much and now they&#39;ve gone and done in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.699" end="00:14:27.059" style="s2">husband which is order so I&#39;m gonna wake</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.120" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">them out so the guards get wind of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.059" end="00:14:30.750" style="s2">and they&#39;re not very happy about it you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:34.709" style="s2">know because after all they&#39;re gone but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.750" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">she is the garden goddess / dragon that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">gave them all life and the probability</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:43.019" style="s2">that they&#39;ll prevail in a battle against</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:45.529" style="s2">that which gave them form is very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.019" end="00:14:49.290" style="s2">low so they&#39;re pretty damn terrified so</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.529" end="00:14:50.839" style="s2">meanwhile time at is generating her army</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.290" end="00:14:52.769" style="s2">and she generates quite an army and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.839" end="00:14:54.990" style="s2">Mesopotamians lists out what she does</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.769" end="00:14:58.199" style="s2">she she first of all picks for her</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.990" end="00:15:01.379" style="s2">concert a new character named King mu</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.199" end="00:15:05.639" style="s2">and King who is like the king of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.379" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">demon monsters so her old husband was</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.639" end="00:15:09.569" style="s2">absolutely maybe he was order and her</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:11.429" style="s2">new husband is like he&#39;s not someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.569" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">that you want to have around at all and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.429" end="00:15:16.709" style="s2">so he&#39;s basically put at the hand of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:18.600" style="s2">this phalanx of terrible monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.709" end="00:15:20.100" style="s2">she generates like scorpion monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.600" end="00:15:21.769" style="s2">crocodile monsters and all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.100" end="00:15:25.009" style="s2">things in her army so that she</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.769" end="00:15:26.959" style="s2">wipe out these these gods and so well</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.009" end="00:15:28.879" style="s2">this is happening the gods gathered</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.959" end="00:15:30.860" style="s2">themselves together and they decide that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.879" end="00:15:32.420" style="s2">they&#39;ll elect a champion from within</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.860" end="00:15:34.730" style="s2">their ranks to go out and fight with</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.420" end="00:15:36.529" style="s2">time out and so they do that they send</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.730" end="00:15:38.299" style="s2">one God out he comes back with his tail</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.529" end="00:15:40.129" style="s2">between his legs roughly speaking all</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.299" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">right don&#39;t let his encounter with chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.129" end="00:15:43.610" style="s2">and then they send another God out the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:45.470" style="s2">same thing happens and they send another</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.610" end="00:15:46.850" style="s2">God out the same thing happens and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.470" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">getting pretty damn hopeless because</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.850" end="00:15:51.470" style="s2">they&#39;re sending out their best men</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:52.730" style="s2">against chaos and them and the mother of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.470" end="00:15:57.439" style="s2">all things and they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.730" end="00:15:59.269" style="s2">stubbled all the time while this was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.439" end="00:16:00.920" style="s2">happening they continued to produce new</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.269" end="00:16:04.189" style="s2">generations of gods and at one point</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.920" end="00:16:07.100" style="s2">this new god emerges as a young person I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.189" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">presume um but he&#39;s there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.100" end="00:16:10.489" style="s2">that are different than about him than</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.839" end="00:16:11.720" style="s2">any other thing that&#39;s being produced so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.489" end="00:16:13.489" style="s2">far and one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.720" end="00:16:15.709" style="s2">different is he&#39;s quite tall and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.489" end="00:16:17.779" style="s2">powerful so you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.709" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">necessarily so radical but he has eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.779" end="00:16:23.329" style="s2">all the way around his head and when he</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:25.249" style="s2">speaks he can speak darkness into being</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.329" end="00:16:28.759" style="s2">and he can speak light into being so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.249" end="00:16:30.619" style="s2">things obey the commands of his words so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.759" end="00:16:32.290" style="s2">he&#39;s a master of language he can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.619" end="00:16:34.399" style="s2">everywhere and he&#39;s a master of language</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.290" end="00:16:35.839" style="s2">okay and so the gods are checking him</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.399" end="00:16:38.059" style="s2">out they think well you know he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.839" end="00:16:40.850" style="s2">quite something maybe we can get him to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.059" end="00:16:42.410" style="s2">go after time mats so they all go to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.850" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">in this in this little group and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.410" end="00:16:47.179" style="s2">say look Marduk cuz that&#39;s his name um</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:49.910" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been checking you out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.179" end="00:16:51.559" style="s2">you&#39;re looking pretty impressive and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.910" end="00:16:53.709" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a proposition for you how</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.559" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">about if you go fight time out and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.709" end="00:17:00.319" style="s2">Marduk who&#39;s not only all-seeing and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:02.509" style="s2">very capable with language is no fool</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.319" end="00:17:04.279" style="s2">and he says yeah yeah yeah I get what</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.509" end="00:17:07.490" style="s2">you want but here&#39;s the deal you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.279" end="00:17:10.970" style="s2">everybody together first and I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:13.220" style="s2">fight your monster but you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.970" end="00:17:16.159" style="s2">a Congress and at that Congress you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.220" end="00:17:19.279" style="s2">gonna elect me king of the gods and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.159" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll go fight time app and so of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.279" end="00:17:22.220" style="s2">the other gods aren&#39;t very happy about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:23.720" style="s2">this but they go off and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.220" end="00:17:25.370" style="s2">Congress and they invite Martic to it</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.720" end="00:17:26.510" style="s2">and they talk about it and they realize</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.370" end="00:17:28.069" style="s2">they don&#39;t really have any other choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.510" end="00:17:30.289" style="s2">so they decide that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.069" end="00:17:34.350" style="s2">elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.289" end="00:17:37.889" style="s2">of gods now that&#39;s such a smart idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.350" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">so if you think for example you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.889" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">think of a hero and then you could think</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">of you took ten heroes and averaged them</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:47.970" style="s2">out of that you get a a god right so B</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:50.009" style="s2">ten heroes you can Aneta here out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.970" end="00:17:52.500" style="s2">that and that would be a god and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.009" end="00:17:54.779" style="s2">maybe you do that to ten sets of ten</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:56.549" style="s2">heroes and you get ten meta heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.779" end="00:17:57.539" style="s2">then you take all those meta heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.549" end="00:17:59.700" style="s2">you figure out what&#39;s the same about</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.539" end="00:18:02.429" style="s2">them and you abstract that out and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.700" end="00:18:04.440" style="s2">you get the hero of Heroes of Heroes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.429" end="00:18:06.389" style="s2">that&#39;s the archetype that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.440" end="00:18:09.299" style="s2">archetype it&#39;s a process of distillation</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.389" end="00:18:12.179" style="s2">it&#39;s like who&#39;s the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.299" end="00:18:14.850" style="s2">possible most interesting and capable</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.179" end="00:18:17.009" style="s2">possible person well that would be this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.850" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">person this is the most memorable</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.009" end="00:18:20.970" style="s2">possible person well we don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.409" style="s2">that is but this is how we figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.970" end="00:18:23.940" style="s2">now I could say well I admire something</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.409" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">about you and I admire something about</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.940" end="00:18:27.690" style="s2">you I can notice that as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">phenomenological fact you seem very</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.690" end="00:18:31.289" style="s2">capable in a certain way and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:34.679" style="s2">you have this attribute and then I might</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.289" end="00:18:38.129" style="s2">say well if I was gonna a sort out an</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.679" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">ideal for myself to follow then I take</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.129" end="00:18:41.730" style="s2">the good parts of all of you and I put</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.950" style="s2">that into one thing and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.730" end="00:18:46.139" style="s2">make that my ideal well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.950" end="00:18:46.649" style="s2">origin of the idea of the savior of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.139" end="00:18:50.669" style="s2">Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.649" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">that&#39;s an emergent idea it emerges when</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.669" end="00:18:55.559" style="s2">people notice that the hero is that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:57.539" style="s2">hero is part of the force that makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.559" end="00:18:59.850" style="s2">order out of chaos or sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.539" end="00:19:00.750" style="s2">reverse when when order has become too</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.850" end="00:19:03.090" style="s2">rigid</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.750" end="00:19:04.679" style="s2">you can also decompose order bring a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.090" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">little necessary chaos into it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.679" end="00:19:09.779" style="s2">rejuvenate the whole structure so</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">anyways so Marduk he gets elected King</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.779" end="00:19:15.539" style="s2">now you might think about how would this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:17.009" style="s2">happen historically speaking well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.539" end="00:19:19.259" style="s2">an interesting way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.009" end="00:19:23.549" style="s2">so imagine a landscape that consists of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.259" end="00:19:26.090" style="s2">tribes okay and then on top of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.549" end="00:19:29.639" style="s2">imagine a landscape of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.090" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">okay so each member of each tribal group</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.639" end="00:19:35.580" style="s2">lives in their imagined world and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.620" style="s2">imagined world is full of dandies and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.580" end="00:19:39.629" style="s2">natural forces of various kinds that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.620" end="00:19:41.700" style="s2">they&#39;re following but then you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.629" end="00:19:44.309" style="s2">imagine that as the tribes battle it out</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.700" end="00:19:46.380" style="s2">and organize themselves the figures of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.309" end="00:19:49.050" style="s2">the imagination do exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.380" end="00:19:51.000" style="s2">so as the people are battling the gods</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.050" end="00:19:54.060" style="s2">in heaven are battling which is also a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.000" end="00:19:56.210" style="s2">very common mythology and as the human</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.060" end="00:19:59.040" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.210" end="00:20:01.680" style="s2">beat themselves into a functional group</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.040" end="00:20:03.900" style="s2">their world conceptions do the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.680" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">thing and so over time you move from</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.900" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">polytheism roughly speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:11.910" style="s2">monotheism as the the as all these</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:15.270" style="s2">tribes communicate with one another</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.910" end="00:20:18.420" style="s2">in language and in and in combat and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.270" end="00:20:20.340" style="s2">sort out just exactly what should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.420" end="00:20:21.930" style="s2">sovereign what should be powerful what</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.340" end="00:20:23.910" style="s2">should be dominant right it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.930" end="00:20:26.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a major issue and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.910" end="00:20:29.010" style="s2">practical it&#39;s partly conceptual so if</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.250" end="00:20:31.290" style="s2">this is reflected in the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:33.870" style="s2">creation myth the gods assemble</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.290" end="00:20:37.380" style="s2">themselves and they look among them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.870" end="00:20:40.890" style="s2">they think okay well someone here is has</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.380" end="00:20:43.740" style="s2">the characteristics that should should</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.890" end="00:20:45.680" style="s2">be the central element of the top deity</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.740" end="00:20:48.860" style="s2">which is like the ultimate value</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.680" end="00:20:52.050" style="s2">okay well the Mesopotamians chose wisely</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.860" end="00:20:55.020" style="s2">vision and language</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.050" end="00:20:58.950" style="s2">those are your most the most potent</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.020" end="00:21:00.930" style="s2">weapons you have against chaos because</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.950" end="00:21:03.810" style="s2">you if you pay attention you can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.930" end="00:21:05.670" style="s2">chaos when it first emerges and then if</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.810" end="00:21:07.650" style="s2">you are a master of language you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.670" end="00:21:09.240" style="s2">encapsulate it and articulate it very</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.650" end="00:21:11.460" style="s2">rapidly and you can communicate that to</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.240" end="00:21:13.980" style="s2">other peoples it&#39;s like now this is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.460" end="00:21:16.650" style="s2">you just cannot overestimate how radical</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.980" end="00:21:18.690" style="s2">an idea that is it&#39;s a staggeringly</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.650" end="00:21:20.490" style="s2">radical idea that that&#39;s the set of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.690" end="00:21:21.870" style="s2">attributes that should be at the top the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.490" end="00:21:24.990" style="s2">Mesopotamians are trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.870" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">what should be sovereign what should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.990" end="00:21:30.540" style="s2">above everything else well you might say</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:32.910" style="s2">a person it&#39;s like yeah yeah no the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.540" end="00:21:34.530" style="s2">person embodies sovereignty sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.910" end="00:21:36.810" style="s2">itself is something else</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.530" end="00:21:39.330" style="s2">so in Fran&#39;s de Waal for example he was</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.810" end="00:21:42.090" style="s2">watching chimpanzees hash it out for</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.330" end="00:21:44.550" style="s2">dominance in in in the zoo and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.090" end="00:21:46.290" style="s2">it&#39;s in the homeland Arnhem I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.550" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">anyways it&#39;s a zoo that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.290" end="00:21:51.390" style="s2">chimpanzees in that he spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:53.610" style="s2">time watching them and you know one idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.390" end="00:21:57.030" style="s2">about the dominant chimp is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.610" end="00:21:58.890" style="s2">just biggest meanest like most</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.030" end="00:22:00.050" style="s2">tyrannical chimp it&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.890" end="00:22:02.540" style="s2">strongman</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.050" end="00:22:04.490" style="s2">of chip leadership but what do all</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.540" end="00:22:07.190" style="s2">observed was that well that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.490" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">true in that the strongest and meanest</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.190" end="00:22:11.780" style="s2">chimpanzee could obtain dominance but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:14.630" style="s2">the problem with him is if he was really</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.780" end="00:22:15.710" style="s2">like selfish and cruel was that he</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.630" end="00:22:17.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any friends</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.710" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">now chips have friends and they spend a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.690" end="00:22:20.390" style="s2">lot of time with them and they groom</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:22.220" style="s2">each other and they protect each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.390" end="00:22:24.200" style="s2">in fights and like you can be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.220" end="00:22:25.370" style="s2">ugliest meanest chimp around but if</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.200" end="00:22:27.410" style="s2">there&#39;s two chimps that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.370" end="00:22:30.710" style="s2">three-quarters your strength coming at</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.410" end="00:22:32.360" style="s2">you it&#39;s like you you lose now so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.710" end="00:22:34.190" style="s2">means two chimps that are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.360" end="00:22:38.900" style="s2">enough civilization to bind themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.190" end="00:22:41.180" style="s2">in to a dyad that is that has mutual</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.900" end="00:22:44.180" style="s2">obligations across time is way stronger</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.180" end="00:22:45.710" style="s2">than one ship who doesn&#39;t and so what</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.180" end="00:22:48.560" style="s2">that means is that strength and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.710" end="00:22:49.970" style="s2">viciousness you know there will be times</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.560" end="00:22:52.460" style="s2">when that can emerge as the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.970" end="00:22:54.440" style="s2">power buts very very unstable and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.460" end="00:22:56.300" style="s2">everyone&#39;s motivated to bring it down as</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.440" end="00:22:57.890" style="s2">fast as possible and the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.300" end="00:22:59.900" style="s2">bring it down is with the coalition and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.890" end="00:23:01.670" style="s2">so partly what that indicates is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.900" end="00:23:03.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the chimp who&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.670" end="00:23:05.720" style="s2">at making coalition&#39;s that&#39;s most likely</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.920" end="00:23:07.250" style="s2">to become sovereign so that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.720" end="00:23:10.550" style="s2">actually what happens with the chimps is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.250" end="00:23:13.550" style="s2">that the dictator chimp is very unstable</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.550" end="00:23:16.390" style="s2">in in the one story I read of Arnhem at</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.550" end="00:23:19.550" style="s2">the arm zoo he rose to the top though</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.390" end="00:23:23.030" style="s2">you know bad bad guy that gangster guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.550" end="00:23:26.420" style="s2">and two chimps went after me torn to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.030" end="00:23:28.730" style="s2">pieces they tore off his testicles yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.420" end="00:23:30.140" style="s2">and you know it agitated the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.730" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">the rest of the truth and it was looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.140" end="00:23:33.740" style="s2">like a bloody revolution you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:37.250" style="s2">really really stressful for the truth</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.740" end="00:23:40.070" style="s2">but but what it indicates and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.250" end="00:23:42.860" style="s2">interesting is that the idea that in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.070" end="00:23:47.030" style="s2">in a dominance hierarchy what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.860" end="00:23:48.620" style="s2">dominant is a power that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.030" end="00:23:51.560" style="s2">evidence whatsoever that that&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.620" end="00:23:54.050" style="s2">in fact I was talking to what I have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.560" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">partner in a business that I have who</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.050" end="00:23:58.370" style="s2">was a student of mine at Harvard he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.900" style="s2">very very smart person and I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.370" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">to him about dominance hierarchies and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.900" end="00:24:04.760" style="s2">he said something very that I found very</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.860" style="s2">upsetting on a variety of levels he said</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.760" end="00:24:08.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not a dominance herky if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.860" end="00:24:10.729" style="s2">put a dog collar on the person</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.539" end="00:24:13.219" style="s2">one level below you which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.729" end="00:24:14.539" style="s2">bloody blunt statement but when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.219" end="00:24:17.239" style="s2">prone to that sort of thing but what he</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.539" end="00:24:19.849" style="s2">meant is that it&#39;s possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.239" end="00:24:21.709" style="s2">idea that the term dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.849" end="00:24:23.809" style="s2">is not the right term to be applying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.709" end="00:24:26.239" style="s2">these sorts of social structures because</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.809" end="00:24:29.119" style="s2">what it implies is that what keeps the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.239" end="00:24:30.349" style="s2">structure in place is power you know and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.119" end="00:24:32.329" style="s2">that&#39;s the sort of claim that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.349" end="00:24:34.309" style="s2">like Foucault make it&#39;s all about power</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.329" end="00:24:37.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like the thing is it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.309" end="00:24:39.019" style="s2">about power it&#39;s not all about power</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.070" end="00:24:42.529" style="s2">it&#39;s not all about power among animals</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.019" end="00:24:43.909" style="s2">so with power with chimps if that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.529" end="00:24:46.369" style="s2">you&#39;ve got is power you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.909" end="00:24:48.079" style="s2">wiped out you have to so what do all</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.369" end="00:24:49.879" style="s2">found was that the chimps who were able</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.079" end="00:24:53.059" style="s2">to establish stable patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.879" end="00:24:55.009" style="s2">leadership were quite congenial they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.059" end="00:24:56.539" style="s2">a lot of allies so they engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.009" end="00:24:58.249" style="s2">mutual grooming and a lot of social</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.539" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">interaction and they were very</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.249" end="00:25:02.989" style="s2">positively predisposed to the females in</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:05.779" style="s2">the troop so that&#39;s pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.989" end="00:25:09.319" style="s2">you know because we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.779" end="00:25:11.979" style="s2">constitutes valid sovereignty but even</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.319" end="00:25:14.419" style="s2">in animals it doesn&#39;t seem to be power</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.979" end="00:25:16.099" style="s2">so and then you know you look at wolf</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.419" end="00:25:17.959" style="s2">pack&#39;s and that sort of thing and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.099" end="00:25:21.109" style="s2">know if two wolves go at it fur for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.959" end="00:25:23.179" style="s2">dominance one wolf will back off and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.109" end="00:25:25.940" style="s2">roll over and show his throat and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.179" end="00:25:31.729" style="s2">know like Stalin wolf would just tear</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.940" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">out his throat but you know Churchill</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.729" end="00:25:34.879" style="s2">wolf let&#39;s say would say well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.379" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of useless but we might need</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.879" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">you around later so why don&#39;t you get up</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.379" end="00:25:40.099" style="s2">and you know we&#39;ll let bygones be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:42.289" style="s2">bygones and that&#39;s what wolves do you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.099" end="00:25:43.579" style="s2">know and and unsurprisingly because what</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.289" end="00:25:46.069" style="s2">are you gonna do kill everyone in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.579" end="00:25:48.229" style="s2">troop well that doesn&#39;t seem like a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.069" end="00:25:49.219" style="s2">effective strategy either for mating or</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.229" end="00:25:51.109" style="s2">for survival</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.219" end="00:25:53.209" style="s2">so the Mesopotamians are trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.109" end="00:25:54.729" style="s2">out practically who&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.209" end="00:25:57.769" style="s2">sovereign and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.729" end="00:25:59.749" style="s2">conceptually what is the proper basis</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.769" end="00:26:02.569" style="s2">for sovereignty which is it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.749" end="00:26:04.609" style="s2">ultimate question in some sense so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.569" end="00:26:06.199" style="s2">anyway so they elect marnik and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.609" end="00:26:10.549" style="s2">Martok&#39;s got all these eyes and he can</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.199" end="00:26:12.229" style="s2">speak and so he thinks all right he says</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.549" end="00:26:14.719" style="s2">if I win I&#39;m gonna get the tablet of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.229" end="00:26:16.999" style="s2">destinies and then I&#39;m talking God and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.719" end="00:26:19.459" style="s2">they say yeah yeah whatever if you win</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.999" end="00:26:21.920" style="s2">no problem so she goes out to fight</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.459" end="00:26:24.260" style="s2">timeout and he takes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.920" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">a sword and he and he takes a net and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.260" end="00:26:28.850" style="s2">they meet on the battlefield and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:30.920" style="s2">encapsulate Stimac in a net which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.850" end="00:26:34.130" style="s2">think is a brilliant brilliant metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.920" end="00:26:36.440" style="s2">again because chaos is amorphous and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.130" end="00:26:38.780" style="s2">unformed right and if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.440" end="00:26:41.180" style="s2">conquer it you have to encapsulate it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.780" end="00:26:42.680" style="s2">within a net a net one you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.180" end="00:26:44.900" style="s2">have to make it into something rather</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.680" end="00:26:48.590" style="s2">than something amorphous you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.900" end="00:26:50.300" style="s2">look maybe a client comes to me and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.590" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">say oh I&#39;ve been having these terrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.300" end="00:26:54.830" style="s2">symptoms on my heart races and I am my</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:26:57.650" style="s2">breath I can&#39;t catch my breath and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.830" end="00:26:59.090" style="s2">think I&#39;m going to die and I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.650" end="00:27:00.380" style="s2">I&#39;m having a heart attack and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.090" end="00:27:02.150" style="s2">at the hospital and they tell me that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.380" end="00:27:04.040" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with me and but I</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.150" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">have and like I&#39;m I&#39;m afraid all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.040" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">time and I&#39;m starting not to go out and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">I say oh you have a graph obeah lots of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:15.290" style="s2">people have that you&#39;re not the only</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">person like that in the world not only</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.290" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">that it has a name we know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:23.780" style="s2">about it and there&#39;s a treatment course</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:26.450" style="s2">and they go and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.780" end="00:27:28.280" style="s2">that the unknown unknown has just been</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.450" end="00:27:31.880" style="s2">turned into a known unknown and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.280" end="00:27:34.040" style="s2">massive improvement and so the person</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.880" end="00:27:36.440" style="s2">who conceptualizes the anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.040" end="00:27:38.540" style="s2">situation fastest is in fact the leader</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.440" end="00:27:39.980" style="s2">that&#39;s the definition of leadership it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.540" end="00:27:42.350" style="s2">like we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.980" end="00:27:44.810" style="s2">this is what&#39;s going on and what and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.350" end="00:27:48.260" style="s2">when you say this is what&#39;s going on you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.810" end="00:27:49.790" style="s2">also simultaneously say here&#39;s a million</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">other things that could have been going</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.790" end="00:27:54.980" style="s2">on that aren&#39;t so it&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:27:56.960" style="s2">radical simplification and it lowers the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.980" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">stress levels immediately anyway so time</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.960" end="00:28:01.430" style="s2">that goes and or an article is he gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.020" style="s2">her in a net and then he splits her in</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.430" end="00:28:04.490" style="s2">half and he makes heaven out of one half</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.020" end="00:28:09.920" style="s2">and the earth other the other for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.490" end="00:28:11.930" style="s2">human beings and and he goes back to and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.920" end="00:28:13.340" style="s2">he defeats Keo and all the monsters and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.930" end="00:28:14.660" style="s2">then he goes back to tell the other gods</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.340" end="00:28:16.760" style="s2">and they&#39;re pretty happy about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.660" end="00:28:19.160" style="s2">king who had the tablet of destinies but</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.760" end="00:28:21.470" style="s2">Martic took that from him and now he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.160" end="00:28:23.300" style="s2">it so he gets to determine destiny and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.470" end="00:28:25.100" style="s2">he makes human beings out of King who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.300" end="00:28:28.100" style="s2">blood which is quite an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.100" end="00:28:31.310" style="s2">little twist to the story and he makes</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.100" end="00:28:33.410" style="s2">them to serve the gods and so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.310" end="00:28:36.020" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.410" end="00:28:37.820" style="s2">so the idea is that the hero who can see</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.020" end="00:28:40.250" style="s2">and can communicate is also the hero who</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.820" end="00:28:42.410" style="s2">separates out the elements of existence</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.250" end="00:28:45.260" style="s2">so that it becomes a habitable place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.410" end="00:28:48.289" style="s2">that humans should serve that serve</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.260" end="00:28:50.929" style="s2">Marduk we have to serve something well</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.289" end="00:28:52.640" style="s2">you&#39;re going to serve a natural force of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.929" end="00:28:54.620" style="s2">some sort you can be all anger you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.640" end="00:28:57.470" style="s2">be all lusty can be all love we gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.620" end="00:29:00.770" style="s2">all hunger or you gonna represent some</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.470" end="00:29:05.270" style="s2">integrated some some balanced and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.770" end="00:29:07.309" style="s2">integrated emergent property of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.270" end="00:29:09.169" style="s2">that&#39;s also socially constructed you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.309" end="00:29:11.990" style="s2">know so that you&#39;re a balance of natural</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.169" end="00:29:13.789" style="s2">forces and you&#39;re a civilized person and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.990" end="00:29:15.500" style="s2">that&#39;s some sort of essence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.789" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to strive for well</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.500" end="00:29:19.789" style="s2">that&#39;s Martin so you&#39;re supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:21.500" style="s2">good Marduk now Margaret is immortal now</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.789" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">the only person who was identified with</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.500" end="00:29:25.900" style="s2">Marduk in the Mesopotamian realm was the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:27.890" style="s2">Emperor now they lived in a walled city</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.900" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">and so what the Emperor</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.890" end="00:29:30.950" style="s2">the reason the Emperor was sovereign was</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:32.809" style="s2">because he was supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.950" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">embodiment of Marduk on earth which</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.809" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">meant that his job was to transform</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:37.850" style="s2">chaos into order</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:39.620" style="s2">whenever chaos threatened he was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.850" end="00:29:42.049" style="s2">supposed to transform it back into order</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.620" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">so this is what the Mesopotamians did at</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.049" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">the New Year&#39;s celebration when the Year</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:47.780" style="s2">is rejuvenated right the old year dies</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">of course we know that because we still</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.780" end="00:29:52.130" style="s2">do it and the new year is this new baby</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:53.809" style="s2">it&#39;s a time of new beginnings so the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.130" end="00:29:56.299" style="s2">Mesopotamians would take the emperor out</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.809" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">of the city and they&#39;d strip him of all</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.299" end="00:30:02.030" style="s2">his emperor clothes and then they&#39;d make</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:04.250" style="s2">him recite all the ways during the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.030" end="00:30:06.740" style="s2">year that he&#39;d been a bad Marduk like he</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.250" end="00:30:08.630" style="s2">hadn&#39;t kept he hadn&#39;t been encountering</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.740" end="00:30:10.669" style="s2">chaos properly and hadn&#39;t been keeping</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.630" end="00:30:13.909" style="s2">order property so he had to confess all</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.669" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">of his inadequacies then the priest</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.909" end="00:30:20.179" style="s2">would whack him with a glove as a you</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:22.730" style="s2">know as a ritual punishment and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.179" end="00:30:26.289" style="s2">they take all the statues out of the old</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.730" end="00:30:29.390" style="s2">guards out of the city and then they re</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.289" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">represent the battle between Marduk and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.390" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">Tiamat and then the Emperor was Martic</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">and he would win and then he would have</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:41.179" style="s2">sex with a ritual prostitute which was</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:43.460" style="s2">that this is a much tougher concept but</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.179" end="00:30:46.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of symbolizing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.460" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">that if the creative force in</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.200" end="00:30:49.770" style="s2">counters the positive element of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:51.900" style="s2">feminine it&#39;s like the prince in</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.770" end="00:30:53.550" style="s2">Sleeping Beauty getting Sleeping Beauty</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.900" end="00:30:55.380" style="s2">from the grasp of the Evil Queen who</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.550" end="00:30:56.940" style="s2">turns into the dragon it&#39;s exactly cuz</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.230" end="00:31:13.890" style="s2">sense but everyone follows it and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:16.050" style="s2">he has to fight his way through that to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.890" end="00:31:18.330" style="s2">get to them to the main it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.050" end="00:31:20.760" style="s2">idea in a different context and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.330" end="00:31:22.740" style="s2">ordered productive order being</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.760" end="00:31:24.150" style="s2">reestablished everybody goes back into</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.740" end="00:31:26.220" style="s2">the kingdom and it&#39;s renewed for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.150" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">next year and that&#39;s the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.220" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">Mesopotamian sovereignty and it&#39;s bloody</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:34.590" style="s2">brilliant because it&#39;s an absence the</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:38.670" style="s2">beginnings of law in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.590" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea that to be to be proper</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.670" end="00:31:44.940" style="s2">even if you&#39;re a despot even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:47.880" style="s2">the king there&#39;s a sacred pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.940" end="00:31:50.910" style="s2">behavior that you must adhere to which</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.880" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">is the consequence of a congress of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.910" end="00:31:55.740" style="s2">gods deciding what the most effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:59.100" style="s2">mode of being is it&#39;s staggeringly</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.740" end="00:32:00.810" style="s2">brilliant and and it took that story we</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.100" end="00:32:02.970" style="s2">just have no idea how long that story</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.810" end="00:32:04.950" style="s2">took to emerge I would say it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.970" end="00:32:07.110" style="s2">consequence of the full course of human</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.950" end="00:32:09.630" style="s2">evolutionary history like the there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.110" end="00:32:12.420" style="s2">elements in it that are as old as</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.630" end="00:32:13.710" style="s2">mammals and maybe older than that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.420" end="00:32:16.980" style="s2">know if you think about those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.710" end="00:32:18.630" style="s2">being embedded in behavior long before</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.980" end="00:32:21.180" style="s2">they were abstracted out into</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.630" end="00:32:23.790" style="s2">representations it&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.180" end="00:32:26.520" style="s2">archaic and ancient and so you have time</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.790" end="00:32:29.130" style="s2">at the Great Mother you have absolute</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.520" end="00:32:31.080" style="s2">the Great Father you have Marduk the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.130" end="00:32:33.450" style="s2">archetypal son you have King oh who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.080" end="00:32:36.090" style="s2">the negative element of Marduk right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.450" end="00:32:38.670" style="s2">you have the drama of all those</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.090" end="00:32:41.880" style="s2">characters interacting across time and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.670" end="00:32:43.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the myth alone that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.880" end="00:32:46.290" style="s2">mythological representation of reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.650" end="00:32:47.850" style="s2">and taya math to tie it into the neural</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.290" end="00:32:50.670" style="s2">psychology that we talked about you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.850" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">we talked about anomaly right and how</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.670" end="00:32:57.480" style="s2">would normally you have a box that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:58.600" style="s2">you&#39;re in that is your world but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.480" end="00:32:59.740" style="s2">box doesn&#39;t contain</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.600" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">anything in the world there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.740" end="00:33:02.919" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t in it and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:05.110" style="s2">they poke their head in like a snake and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.919" end="00:33:07.720" style="s2">then that&#39;s disruptive and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.110" end="00:33:10.600" style="s2">do well you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.720" end="00:33:12.340" style="s2">voluntarily encounter the snake and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.600" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">either defeat it or make something</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.340" end="00:33:15.970" style="s2">valuable of you know you could cower and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:17.980" style="s2">hide but all that generally means the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.970" end="00:33:19.720" style="s2">snake grows and grows until there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.980" end="00:33:21.340" style="s2">hardly any you in the box and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.720" end="00:33:23.860" style="s2">all snakes and that&#39;s actually the best</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.340" end="00:33:25.929" style="s2">of Damien&#39;s story it&#39;s like if the Elder</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.860" end="00:33:28.030" style="s2">Gods weren&#39;t so careless and had been</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.929" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">paying attention and hadn&#39;t killed</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.030" end="00:33:34.390" style="s2">absolute time that would have stayed</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:39.340" style="s2">asleep the whole time so mom so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.390" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">the that&#39;s the level of isomorphism so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.340" end="00:33:44.049" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s fascinating but I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:47.980" style="s2">inevitable is that the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.049" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">reflects the physiology but how could it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.980" end="00:33:52.450" style="s2">not the physiology produced the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:53.799" style="s2">mythology like of course that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.450" end="00:33:56.530" style="s2">be the case it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.799" end="00:33:58.600" style="s2">it should be it should be that we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.530" end="00:33:59.799" style="s2">be the reverse should be a surprise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.600" end="00:34:01.510" style="s2">like there&#39;s no relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.799" end="00:34:03.100" style="s2">these these old stories in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.510" end="00:34:09.539" style="s2">human beings are structured it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.100" end="00:34:09.539" style="s2">well no no that&#39;s a dumb idea so</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.679" end="00:34:19.690" style="s2">well that&#39;s the mesopotamian creation</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.589" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">myth and it&#39;s it&#39;s a killer it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.690" end="00:34:24.639" style="s2">it&#39;s a staggering story and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:27.159" style="s2">still sits whether we know it or not</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.639" end="00:34:29.950" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s at the very base of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.159" end="00:34:33.639" style="s2">culture it&#39;s absolute that&#39;s story and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.950" end="00:34:37.720" style="s2">if we kill it which we will or have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.639" end="00:34:41.230" style="s2">then then look out you know we know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.720" end="00:34:44.319" style="s2">story from so long ago if you let your</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.230" end="00:34:47.379" style="s2">culture die and act carelessly towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.319" end="00:34:52.119" style="s2">it all hell will break loose and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.379" end="00:34:59.289" style="s2">joke so so here we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.119" end="00:35:02.410" style="s2">revivify it it&#39;s pretty weird that these</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.289" end="00:35:04.029" style="s2">things happen to be real but then if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.410" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">think about it well how could it be</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.029" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.480" end="00:35:10.809" style="s2">you know you think all these people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:12.900" style="s2">live before us for the tens of millions</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.809" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">of years that you know we&#39;ve had our</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.900" end="00:35:23.589" style="s2">FEGLI human producers were stupid they</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:25.089" style="s2">weren&#39;t and they weren&#39;t ignorant and</p>
