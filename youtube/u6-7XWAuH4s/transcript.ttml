<p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">right that&#39;s a really important role I</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.829" end="00:02:03.180" style="s2">think what I would do is maybe try not</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">to second-guess yourself so much if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.180" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">think there&#39;s a thread that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">be paying attention to and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">to make us see it with gorilla artwork</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">then you know explore and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:16.970" style="s2">discover so</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:19.490" style="s2">anyway more power to you all right next</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.970" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">question from last time my mother is 75</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.490" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2">and I&#39;ve tried to further explain unity</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:25.730" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t understand dual governing</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:27.860" style="s2">she keeps saying people don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.730" end="00:02:30.740" style="s2">together tips on what I can say shall be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.860" end="00:02:32.660" style="s2">on board if she gets it it&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.740" end="00:02:34.100" style="s2">yeah it is cool message look I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.660" end="00:02:35.780" style="s2">people do work together I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.100" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">not used to seeing it because we&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.780" end="00:02:40.040" style="s2">to seeing them in zero sum or negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:42.950" style="s2">sum dynamics which brings out the worst</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.040" end="00:02:45.500" style="s2">in people but if you set up a team and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.950" end="00:02:46.760" style="s2">the idea is the success condition looks</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.500" end="00:02:50.240" style="s2">like can you figure out how to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.760" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">together then people don&#39;t want to find</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.240" end="00:02:55.100" style="s2">themselves in failure condition what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.880" end="00:02:58.190" style="s2">more I mean maybe this is the crux of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.100" end="00:03:00.770" style="s2">the matter we are so far away from</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.190" end="00:03:03.890" style="s2">policy that works in the interests of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.770" end="00:03:06.650" style="s2">most people that doing better than we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.890" end="00:03:08.600" style="s2">are doing is actually easy right if all</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.650" end="00:03:11.000" style="s2">you did was sweep away the corrupting</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.600" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">influences then figuring out what would</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.000" end="00:03:15.080" style="s2">be in the interests of the American</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">public is easy at first there comes a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.080" end="00:03:18.860" style="s2">point at which you&#39;ve done all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:20.299" style="s2">that makes sense right and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.860" end="00:03:21.890" style="s2">have disagreements about whether you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.299" end="00:03:24.709" style="s2">want to prioritize this value or that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.890" end="00:03:26.780" style="s2">value but until you get to all the basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.709" end="00:03:29.420" style="s2">stuff that needs to just work then</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.780" end="00:03:32.299" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in arguing right good</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.420" end="00:03:35.269" style="s2">people who have heard the various inputs</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.299" end="00:03:36.680" style="s2">to the decision-making process will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.269" end="00:03:39.590" style="s2">able to reach agreement they may not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.680" end="00:03:41.900" style="s2">nail it right they may pick a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.590" end="00:03:44.780" style="s2">best healthcare solution rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.900" end="00:03:46.430" style="s2">absolute best one because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.780" end="00:03:48.500" style="s2">impossible to know enough to get it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.430" end="00:03:50.900" style="s2">exactly right but the point is a second</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.500" end="00:03:52.459" style="s2">best health care solution would be about</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.900" end="00:03:54.709" style="s2">a billion times better than the cruddy</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.459" end="00:03:56.090" style="s2">one we have now so the point is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.709" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">let&#39;s get to one of the good ones and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.090" end="00:03:59.299" style="s2">then we can argue about whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:01.489" style="s2">we got it exactly right and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.299" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">you know fight about ideology but at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.489" end="00:04:05.420" style="s2">moment the ideology is hey let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:09.590" style="s2">some policy that serves us because</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.420" end="00:04:12.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to do next one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.590" end="00:04:14.840" style="s2">is a comment says Unity 2020 is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.890" end="00:04:16.609" style="s2">politically naive it would elect a wet</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.840" end="00:04:18.169" style="s2">centrist and change nothing as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.609" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">founding member of the first against the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.169" end="00:04:22.490" style="s2">wall&#39; Club I say Bret should run or we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">kick him out of the club it&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.490" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">kind are you trying to get me killed no</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:27.770" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not about centrist</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.940" end="00:04:29.210" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say this very clearly because</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.770" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">I think this is important first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.210" end="00:04:32.810" style="s2">have no patience with centrist and I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:34.670" style="s2">very frequently the person challenging</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.810" end="00:04:38.480" style="s2">the whole idea of centrism because I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.670" end="00:04:40.820" style="s2">think it&#39;s absurd however the center is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.480" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">where we meet all right the Patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.820" end="00:04:44.270" style="s2">center is where we meet to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">the immediate interests of the nation</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.270" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">right we can you know if you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:52.700" style="s2">ship and it is sinking because it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.270" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">taking on water then the point is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.700" end="00:04:57.170" style="s2">put aside your differences about ship</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">design and you deal with the question of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.170" end="00:04:59.990" style="s2">how do we get the water to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">ship faster than its coming in right</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.990" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what the center looks like it</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:06.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that the people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:08.210" style="s2">the bilge mechanism don&#39;t have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.860" end="00:05:09.260" style="s2">about how you might construct a ship</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.210" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2">that would prevent this from happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.260" end="00:05:14.230" style="s2">in the future they might but in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.450" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">meantime the ship is taking on water</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.230" end="00:05:19.460" style="s2">everybody grab a bucket and let&#39;s deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:20.870" style="s2">with the immediate problem right by</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.460" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">putting aside our ideological</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.870" end="00:05:23.450" style="s2">differences which frankly if we talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:28.460" style="s2">about them now they&#39;re gonna get us</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.450" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">killed with struggle sessions emerging</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.460" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">in the workplace this is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:34.250" style="s2">opportunity for actual liberals to</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:36.500" style="s2">resurrect a label organization labor</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.250" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">organization to protect workers I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.500" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">even many conservatives could be brought</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">on board I like this idea I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:48.169" style="s2">how actionable it is it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:50.360" style="s2">resurrection of anything that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.169" end="00:05:54.290" style="s2">traditionally liberal right now is going</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:57.260" style="s2">to be met with some some pretty fierce</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.290" end="00:06:00.040" style="s2">offense from anyone who&#39;s observing</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.260" end="00:06:01.910" style="s2">what&#39;s going on the farm pseudo left and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.040" end="00:06:04.850" style="s2">conflating that with the left more</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.910" end="00:06:07.700" style="s2">broadly yeah I agree and I think in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.850" end="00:06:09.860" style="s2">sense what we&#39;re talking about is a 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.700" end="00:06:12.169" style="s2">version of something that labor unions</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:13.250" style="s2">tried to do and failed to do largely in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.169" end="00:06:15.169" style="s2">this country it&#39;s not that they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.250" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">succeed they accomplished a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.169" end="00:06:20.510" style="s2">but they also became corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:23.480" style="s2">sluggish and an obstacle to to positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.510" end="00:06:25.790" style="s2">change in many cases so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.480" end="00:06:26.870" style="s2">looking for is something I mean look we</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.790" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">offshored</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">the jobs that traditionally go along</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:33.979" style="s2">with labor unions most of them right</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.250" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve still got you know police and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.979" end="00:06:37.250" style="s2">teachers and stuff like that but in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">general the manufacturing jobs that were</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.250" end="00:06:41.960" style="s2">the bulk of the unionized</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:43.819" style="s2">kurz are all gone so in some sense we</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.960" end="00:06:46.370" style="s2">have to figure out what to do to protect</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.819" end="00:06:48.979" style="s2">the people who were once in union</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.370" end="00:06:51.050" style="s2">izybelle jobs who are now in cruddy or</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.979" end="00:06:54.919" style="s2">jobs we have to resurrect some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.050" end="00:06:57.530" style="s2">useful sector for people to to work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.919" end="00:07:00.610" style="s2">if work is even the right model or to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.530" end="00:07:03.530" style="s2">productive in might be better but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:05.539" style="s2">think in some sense all of this stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:07.189" style="s2">mean the problem with Bernie all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.539" end="00:07:10.189" style="s2">the problem with Bernie is that all of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.189" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">his solutions are backward looking right</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.189" end="00:07:15.259" style="s2">the backward is not where we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:17.090" style="s2">find the right solution for the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.259" end="00:07:18.500" style="s2">century so although I mean to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.090" end="00:07:21.740" style="s2">this question doesn&#39;t actually use the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.500" end="00:07:22.849" style="s2">word Union right it says resurrect okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.740" end="00:07:24.289" style="s2">that appears to be thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.849" end="00:07:26.750" style="s2">something that&#39;s already been done but</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.289" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">labor organization and you know the idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.750" end="00:07:31.639" style="s2">of protecting the rights of workers</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:34.189" style="s2">against that of the employers is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.639" end="00:07:36.710" style="s2">inherently a backward facing idea well I</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.189" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">would put it differently I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.710" end="00:07:41.449" style="s2">problem is that we have a system in</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:42.740" style="s2">which corruption advances the interests</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.449" end="00:07:44.930" style="s2">of what once might have been called</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.740" end="00:07:46.659" style="s2">management against the interests of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.930" end="00:07:50.659" style="s2">what once might have been called labor</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.659" end="00:07:53.690" style="s2">so that artificial advantage in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.659" end="00:07:56.360" style="s2">political sphere to management is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.690" end="00:07:57.830" style="s2">hazard to everybody what you really want</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.360" end="00:07:59.629" style="s2">to do is level the playing field so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.830" end="00:08:01.819" style="s2">everybody&#39;s interests as citizens are</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.629" end="00:08:03.889" style="s2">advanced by the system that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.819" end="00:08:06.020" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s in management is also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.889" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">citizen all right they&#39;re interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.020" end="00:08:10.759" style="s2">get taken care of but their interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.430" end="00:08:12.939" style="s2">don&#39;t get priority and so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.759" end="00:08:16.069" style="s2">point is labor is actually the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.939" end="00:08:17.839" style="s2">place for this to exist it was a place</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.069" end="00:08:19.879" style="s2">that it could exist by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.839" end="00:08:21.620" style="s2">fact that it organized people in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.879" end="00:08:24.110" style="s2">way that allowed them to become</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.620" end="00:08:28.159" style="s2">politically affiliated but I think in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.110" end="00:08:29.830" style="s2">some sense it was a partial solution to</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.159" end="00:08:34.099" style="s2">a problem that needs a complete solution</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.830" end="00:08:35.570" style="s2">yep okay so one remaining question from</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.099" end="00:08:38.870" style="s2">last time before we get to today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.570" end="00:08:40.339" style="s2">questions how do you been totally</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:41.959" style="s2">different topic how do you feel about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.339" end="00:08:44.390" style="s2">the legal and ethical hunting of animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.959" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">in North America I have a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.390" end="00:08:48.079" style="s2">for asking this question lol so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:49.550" style="s2">aren&#39;t told what the good reason for</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.079" end="00:08:51.560" style="s2">asking a question is but the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.550" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">how do we feel about the legal and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.560" end="00:08:53.400" style="s2">ethical hunting of animals on earth</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:57.210" style="s2">where of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.400" end="00:08:59.400" style="s2">putting the word ethical there is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.210" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">ants you know it&#39;s a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.400" end="00:09:04.890" style="s2">strange addition but maybe the idea just</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:07.530" style="s2">is hunting that is currently within the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.890" end="00:09:10.350" style="s2">balance of the law and is done in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.530" end="00:09:12.840" style="s2">that say most reasonable people would</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.350" end="00:09:14.730" style="s2">see as ethical yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.840" end="00:09:16.620" style="s2">well I think I think a lot in jizan</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.730" end="00:09:19.710" style="s2">what&#39;s meant by ethical here because on</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.620" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">the one hand in principle I have no</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.710" end="00:09:25.230" style="s2">objection to people hunting in practice</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:26.610" style="s2">there are lots of things about the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.230" end="00:09:30.450" style="s2">hunting is done that I think are very</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.610" end="00:09:33.300" style="s2">objectionable and the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.450" end="00:09:34.940" style="s2">destroyed so much habitat for the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.300" end="00:09:36.960" style="s2">of creatures that are worth hunting</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.940" end="00:09:38.910" style="s2">means that this is a very different</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.960" end="00:09:44.280" style="s2">puzzle because it&#39;s inherently in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.910" end="00:09:45.510" style="s2">sense a sport for the few so yea though</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.280" end="00:09:49.770" style="s2">it&#39;s also true where I thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.510" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">going there is was because we&#39;ve because</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.770" end="00:09:53.790" style="s2">we&#39;ve managed to clear the habitat</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">largely of the carnivores that would be</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.790" end="00:09:57.900" style="s2">eating the kinds of things that we tend</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:10:02.370" style="s2">to hunt not not us but you know deer and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.900" end="00:10:04.380" style="s2">elk and and such that there is calling</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.370" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">that needs to happen because the culling</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.380" end="00:10:08.250" style="s2">that would be happening by the Predators</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">that we&#39;ve already eradicated isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.250" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">happening and so to some degree hunters</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:14.340" style="s2">are doing a job that is mandated by our</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">already poor decisions over the last</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.340" end="00:10:18.960" style="s2">hundred years I do agree with that right</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.800" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s also true you know we I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.960" end="00:10:23.520" style="s2">think you did too but I certainly I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:27.900" style="s2">often had students who were hunters and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.520" end="00:10:29.820" style="s2">would sometimes bring bring meat you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.900" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">know gift gift me meat to get you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.820" end="00:10:35.910" style="s2">gift us meat and it was wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:37.890" style="s2">hearing these guys always guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.910" end="00:10:40.200" style="s2">they often were hunting with with their</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.890" end="00:10:42.960" style="s2">wives or girlfriends or female friends</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.200" end="00:10:46.230" style="s2">but you know I assume that hunting</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.960" end="00:10:48.120" style="s2">excuse very male and as it happens all</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.230" end="00:10:51.060" style="s2">of my students who were hunters who with</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.120" end="00:10:54.020" style="s2">whom I talked about it were male talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.060" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2">to them about their stories of being out</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.020" end="00:11:00.780" style="s2">out in nature of doing regular annual or</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.750" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">seasonal hunts either alone or with</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.780" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">groups of friends that they always did</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">they always did the same that went to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">the same place they had</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:11.999" style="s2">they had this tradition built around it</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.990" end="00:11:16.589" style="s2">was extraordinary from several</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.999" end="00:11:18.720" style="s2">perspectives not just the social aspect</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.589" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">you know the the the bonding between</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.720" end="00:11:22.740" style="s2">human beings that they could look</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:23.730" style="s2">forward to all year and know that it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.740" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">going to happen again</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.730" end="00:11:29.610" style="s2">but also the being out in nature and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:31.499" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s no secret in most</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.610" end="00:11:33.709" style="s2">circles that actually people who hunt</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.499" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">and fish are some of the most ardent</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.709" end="00:11:37.740" style="s2">conservationists because they see what</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:41.220" style="s2">encroaching of development on habitat</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.740" end="00:11:44.040" style="s2">does to habitat in populations and such</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.220" end="00:11:46.949" style="s2">so you know those those two huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.040" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">benefits where the action itself is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.949" end="00:11:56.569" style="s2">hunting was it&#39;s extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.360" end="00:12:00.329" style="s2">and yes so long as the hunting is done</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.569" end="00:12:03.480" style="s2">ethically you know meaning you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.329" end="00:12:05.249" style="s2">meaning a lot of things I guess well I</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.480" end="00:12:07.350" style="s2">mean I think the problem is that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.249" end="00:12:11.399" style="s2">means a lot of things right bow hunting</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.350" end="00:12:13.589" style="s2">in some sense is more organic the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.399" end="00:12:15.959" style="s2">advantage over the animal is less on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.589" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">other hand I&#39;m guessing that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.959" end="00:12:21.839" style="s2">likelihood of a wounded animal running</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:25.579" style="s2">off with an arrow in it and suffering</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.839" end="00:12:27.329" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know perhaps escaping and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.579" end="00:12:29.459" style="s2">suffering you think it might be greater</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.329" end="00:12:30.389" style="s2">with bow hunting done was done I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.459" end="00:12:32.100" style="s2">know I&#39;d be curious I guess we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.389" end="00:12:33.899" style="s2">to find out because I&#39;m out just set it</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.100" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">live on the internet to thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.899" end="00:12:39.089" style="s2">people but but I would say I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:41.999" style="s2">actually a frank conversation needs to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.089" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">happen more much more troubling than bow</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.999" end="00:12:48.120" style="s2">hunting of various kinds of DRL</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">concluded to me would be things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.120" end="00:12:52.829" style="s2">bear baiting which was an issue when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:54.629" style="s2">lived in Michigan so people would bait</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.829" end="00:12:56.459" style="s2">bears and the Bears would come to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.629" end="00:12:58.139" style="s2">bait and people would shoot them and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.459" end="00:13:02.939" style="s2">frankly I find that completely barbaric</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.139" end="00:13:04.790" style="s2">and now I&#39;m told by people no less than</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.939" end="00:13:07.980" style="s2">Joe Rogan that bears are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.790" end="00:13:10.889" style="s2">problematic animals that aren&#39;t so cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.980" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">I disagree with this but nonetheless I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.889" end="00:13:15.270" style="s2">get that there is something deeper here</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:21.090" style="s2">than a desire to you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.270" end="00:13:23.340" style="s2">to just kill cool stuff but but to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.090" end="00:13:26.190" style="s2">honest personally and I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.340" end="00:13:28.670" style="s2">I can defend this completely but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.190" end="00:13:31.020" style="s2">more troubled with the killing of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.670" end="00:13:35.160" style="s2">creatures that are slower to reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.020" end="00:13:39.240" style="s2">and smarter and you know a bear is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.160" end="00:13:42.630" style="s2">highly intelligent animal and so I am</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.240" end="00:13:47.000" style="s2">more troubled by its trauma than I am a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.630" end="00:13:49.470" style="s2">deer probably because deer are built to</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.000" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">live shorter lives and be more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.470" end="00:13:54.180" style="s2">be predated upon it&#39;s convenient and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:57.210" style="s2">maybe no accident that that Maps very</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.180" end="00:13:59.220" style="s2">neatly on to predator versus prey and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.210" end="00:14:00.990" style="s2">that you know the carnivores that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.220" end="00:14:02.820" style="s2">out there that are predators of the more</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.990" end="00:14:05.400" style="s2">usual things that people hunt deer and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.820" end="00:14:06.270" style="s2">elk and rabbits and and such duck I</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.400" end="00:14:11.820" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.270" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">bears don&#39;t hunt duck do they that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.820" end="00:14:18.900" style="s2">also the meat of carnivores also isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:20.340" style="s2">nearly as tasty or or nutritious or safe</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.900" end="00:14:22.140" style="s2">for us to eat in you and something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.340" end="00:14:24.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t eat the liver of a carnivore</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.140" end="00:14:24.660" style="s2">that&#39;s actually like really not good for</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.150" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.660" end="00:14:28.740" style="s2">and so you know eating carnivores are</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:30.600" style="s2">effectively second-order herbivores the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.740" end="00:14:32.250" style="s2">closer to herbivore you get closer to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.600" end="00:14:34.770" style="s2">first order herbivore you get the better</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.250" end="00:14:36.120" style="s2">the meat is for you and and tastier so</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.770" end="00:14:37.530" style="s2">just like you shouldn&#39;t be eating human</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.120" end="00:14:39.660" style="s2">meat you shouldn&#39;t meeting bear meat or</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.530" end="00:14:42.330" style="s2">lion meat or anything and so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.660" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">not eating it what are you doing why why</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.330" end="00:14:46.760" style="s2">are you killing it yeah my guess would</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">be that we need to have a rethink of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.760" end="00:14:53.280" style="s2">hunting that involves a resurrection of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:54.870" style="s2">our appreciation for wilderness and an</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.280" end="00:14:59.790" style="s2">extension of it so that it there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.870" end="00:15:01.350" style="s2">of it and then a question about what to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.790" end="00:15:03.000" style="s2">the extent there is hunting what should</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.350" end="00:15:04.350" style="s2">people be hunting with you know should</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.000" end="00:15:07.860" style="s2">they be firing lead into the wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.350" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">probably not you know high powered</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.860" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">weapons is that a good idea what weapons</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.060" style="s2">are most humane I don&#39;t know but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">should be having that conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.060" end="00:15:21.030" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re not yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">okay first question from the livestream</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.030" end="00:15:24.900" style="s2">that just ended this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:27.570" style="s2">logistical question really is there a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.900" end="00:15:29.520" style="s2">way we can document in writing your</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.570" end="00:15:31.830" style="s2">conversation with a black intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.520" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">roundtable I see it as possibly one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.830" end="00:15:37.350" style="s2">those brainstorming charts with each</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:38.550" style="s2">individual&#39;s response thank you both for</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.350" end="00:15:40.830" style="s2">what you do I&#39;ll support you in any way</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.550" end="00:15:43.260" style="s2">I can so this person is asking for some</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.830" end="00:15:44.340" style="s2">kind of basically a transcript which we</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.260" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">don&#39;t have the ability to do at this</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.340" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">point but it&#39;s possible that YouTube is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:52.020" style="s2">going to do that automatically if</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not perfect but it does a decent</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.020" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">job of subtitling which could easily</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:58.980" style="s2">become a transcript so I don&#39;t frankly I</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:02.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that setting is on or not</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.980" end="00:16:04.620" style="s2">I will say that conversation a lots of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.580" end="00:16:07.620" style="s2">people have loved it which is great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.620" end="00:16:09.270" style="s2">really I&#39;m really excited that people</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.620" end="00:16:10.920" style="s2">dug the conversation and then it went</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.270" end="00:16:12.630" style="s2">well I mean I knew that it would go well</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.920" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">but that group of people how could it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.630" end="00:16:19.410" style="s2">not but I also think that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:21.210" style="s2">just the tip of the iceberg that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.410" end="00:16:23.790" style="s2">is so much to be said on many of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.210" end="00:16:25.380" style="s2">topics and I am looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.790" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">continuing those conversations however</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.380" end="00:16:29.820" style="s2">it happens could be a second round table</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:32.430" style="s2">could be individual conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.820" end="00:16:36.060" style="s2">people present on that podcast or people</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.430" end="00:16:37.800" style="s2">who see it and weren&#39;t present some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.060" end="00:16:39.810" style="s2">whom were invited and didn&#39;t get back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.800" end="00:16:41.400" style="s2">me but anyway there&#39;s lots of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.810" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">lots of room for that conversation to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.400" end="00:16:48.840" style="s2">extended and I hope to do it soon as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.760" style="s2">psych major the inculcation of critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.840" end="00:16:52.710" style="s2">theory and post-modernism is troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.760" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">will it eventually leave an indelible</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.710" end="00:16:57.060" style="s2">mark on the industry&#39;s reputation is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:58.680" style="s2">there hope for social science how should</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.060" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2">we comport ourselves to compat woken us</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.680" end="00:17:03.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of questions to the first one</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.770" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">will it leave an indelible mark on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.210" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">on the industry&#39;s reputation oh it has I</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:09.329" style="s2">think that that ship has sailed</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:12.630" style="s2">is there hope for social science more</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.329" end="00:17:15.540" style="s2">broadly you know I&#39;d say that some sub</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.630" end="00:17:20.010" style="s2">disciplines in psych and an anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.540" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">are doing better than others sociology</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.010" end="00:17:26.370" style="s2">seems to be largely captured cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:29.640" style="s2">anthropology done you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.370" end="00:17:30.540" style="s2">tough I&#39;d say it this way we&#39;ve got lots</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.640" end="00:17:31.920" style="s2">of disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.540" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">that are in various states of</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.920" end="00:17:37.800" style="s2">dysfunction many of them were founded</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:40.560" style="s2">around the right question right ecology</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.800" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">we found it to be not completely a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.560" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2">wasteland but almost a wasteland of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:47.370" style="s2">quality thinking and work right not</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:51.480" style="s2">social science though oh I know but my</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.370" end="00:17:52.770" style="s2">point is ecology is still a home for</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.480" end="00:17:55.170" style="s2">many of the most important questions</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.770" end="00:17:56.670" style="s2">about how creatures interact with each</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.170" end="00:18:00.510" style="s2">other so it&#39;s sort of how evolution</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.670" end="00:18:02.760" style="s2">happens in real time right so so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.510" end="00:18:04.770" style="s2">metaphor that we would use is evolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.760" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">is the movie in ecology is the still</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.770" end="00:18:08.820" style="s2">from the movie that you is is the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:11.490" style="s2">that you have access to inferring what</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.820" end="00:18:13.290" style="s2">the movie says right so there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.490" end="00:18:14.790" style="s2">to do it right and maybe it will</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.290" end="00:18:17.220" style="s2">resurrect itself and the same goes for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.790" end="00:18:18.510" style="s2">many of these social sciences now some</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.220" end="00:18:20.430" style="s2">of them are just phony fields that were</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.510" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">made up right critical theory is a phony</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.430" end="00:18:24.360" style="s2">nonsense field it doesn&#39;t mean there</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a kernel of an idea there but</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.360" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not one that needs vast elaboration</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:33.450" style="s2">on the other hand social psychology for</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:35.130" style="s2">example is a very important set of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.450" end="00:18:37.020" style="s2">questions fundamentally important</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.130" end="00:18:38.700" style="s2">probably necessary to our long-term</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.020" end="00:18:40.500" style="s2">survival that we figure out where the</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.500" end="00:18:44.010" style="s2">and there is historical work that&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:19:13.530" end="00:19:16.560" style="s2">important that we don&#39;t toss the</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.200" end="00:19:44.759" style="s2">seeking is it dangerous to label a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.389" end="00:19:46.729" style="s2">villain class so I think this is going</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.759" end="00:19:50.190" style="s2">to be about the black intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.729" end="00:19:53.009" style="s2">Roundtable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.190" end="00:19:58.279" style="s2">so rent seeking is self defined it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.009" end="00:20:00.749" style="s2">the the earning of profit through</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.279" end="00:20:02.129" style="s2">non-productive activity in other words</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.749" end="00:20:04.830" style="s2">the economy is supposed to pay you for</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.129" end="00:20:07.409" style="s2">producing something useful but there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.830" end="00:20:09.720" style="s2">mechanisms where you can extract rent</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.409" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">you know the way a warlord does for</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.720" end="00:20:13.739" style="s2">example right you can prevent somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:15.869" style="s2">from passing down a road they need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.739" end="00:20:17.759" style="s2">pass down and so you can effectively</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.869" end="00:20:20.249" style="s2">extort money from them and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.759" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">obviously illegal but there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.249" end="00:20:25.229" style="s2">legal ways to block people&#39;s access to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:28.649" style="s2">things and then charge them for access</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.229" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">that you did not add anything to so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.649" end="00:20:33.419" style="s2">reason that I define rent seekers as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:35.999" style="s2">problem is that it&#39;s self defined I am</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.419" end="00:20:37.979" style="s2">NOT saying these people are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.999" end="00:20:39.809" style="s2">rent seekers in fact what I have said is</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.979" end="00:20:41.549" style="s2">in many cases you have somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.809" end="00:20:43.349" style="s2">contributed something important that has</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.549" end="00:20:45.509" style="s2">made them powerful but then having</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.349" end="00:20:46.830" style="s2">become powerful they learned to rent see</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.509" end="00:20:48.809" style="s2">they may not even realize they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.830" end="00:20:50.849" style="s2">it in other words they may have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.809" end="00:20:52.409" style="s2">experience of what I brought important</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.849" end="00:20:54.749" style="s2">things into the world and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.409" end="00:20:56.519" style="s2">handsomely rewarded therefore I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.749" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">productive right the answer is now</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.519" end="00:21:00.899" style="s2">you&#39;re twenty percent productive and 80</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.039" style="s2">percent rent-seeking or vice versa we</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.899" end="00:21:04.409" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s going to be different in</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.039" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">each case but the point is it is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.409" end="00:21:08.460" style="s2">rent seeking behavior that is the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:10.200" style="s2">and to the extent that we leave niches</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.460" end="00:21:12.769" style="s2">open where people learn how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.200" end="00:21:15.539" style="s2">thing we have to shut those down and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.769" end="00:21:17.309" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say we have to zero the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.539" end="00:21:19.349" style="s2">accounts of people who rent seek in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.309" end="00:21:21.179" style="s2">I think the primary thing is to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.349" end="00:21:24.720" style="s2">this behavior from continuing into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.179" end="00:21:26.639" style="s2">future and the better we can get a match</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.720" end="00:21:28.830" style="s2">between producing things that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.639" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">actually useful to the economy you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.830" end="00:21:33.239" style="s2">be they services or goods or innovations</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:35.340" style="s2">or whatever they are that we can get</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.239" end="00:21:38.070" style="s2">those things to match the remuneration</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.340" end="00:21:39.480" style="s2">then the system evolves in the writer</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.070" end="00:21:41.220" style="s2">to the extent that rent-seeking is where</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.480" end="00:21:43.830" style="s2">the money is made it evolves in a bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.220" end="00:21:44.610" style="s2">direction so I would say that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.830" end="00:21:46.800" style="s2">little breach</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.610" end="00:21:50.340" style="s2">okay finish I think that we do have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.800" end="00:21:53.190" style="s2">language problem and I am so ignorant of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.340" end="00:21:54.840" style="s2">economics I do not know where the term</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.190" end="00:21:57.060" style="s2">rent-seeking emerges from and why the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.840" end="00:21:59.460" style="s2">term rent is is in there and what it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.060" end="00:22:01.020" style="s2">to do historically with the common</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.460" end="00:22:03.270" style="s2">parlance use of the term rent when</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.020" end="00:22:07.620" style="s2">people pay rent to a landlord but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.270" end="00:22:10.110" style="s2">fact that defund the police and cancel</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.620" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">rent are two of the really you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.110" end="00:22:14.160" style="s2">primary hashtags right now that are part</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">of this sort of you know Maoist</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.160" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">revolution in the streets that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:20.640" style="s2">experiencing cannot be helping when we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:24.090" style="s2">separately try to talk about rent</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.640" end="00:22:27.900" style="s2">seeking behavior because people who own</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.090" end="00:22:31.980" style="s2">property who are charging rent for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.900" end="00:22:35.400" style="s2">privilege of living on that property is</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.980" end="00:22:37.800" style="s2">you know that is not productive in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.400" end="00:22:40.380" style="s2">way that generating ideas and solving</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.800" end="00:22:43.680" style="s2">societal problems is productive but we</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.380" end="00:22:45.780" style="s2">are also you know when you where we talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.680" end="00:22:47.910" style="s2">about rent seeking we are not saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.780" end="00:22:49.500" style="s2">cancel rent we&#39;re not saying get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.910" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">landlords we&#39;re not saying get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.500" end="00:22:53.910" style="s2">private property and I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know historically why those are -</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.910" end="00:22:56.580" style="s2">why those are the same words it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.170" style="s2">probably the actual same word like I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.580" end="00:23:01.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know logically but it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.170" end="00:23:03.180" style="s2">be confusing so I think think I know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.170" end="00:23:04.350" style="s2">answer to this okay so what I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.180" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">about rent seekers we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.350" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">what&#39;s called economic rent now I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:11.730" style="s2">believe that rent in the sense of pay</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:13.590" style="s2">your rent mm-hmm is actually yes derived</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.730" end="00:23:16.020" style="s2">from the same concept and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.590" end="00:23:18.390" style="s2">this conversation goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.020" end="00:23:21.180" style="s2">georgous the Henry George House of land</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.390" end="00:23:26.310" style="s2">value taxation Fame so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.180" end="00:23:28.560" style="s2">interesting economic philosophy that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.310" end="00:23:31.310" style="s2">basically views everything through a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.560" end="00:23:37.470" style="s2">lens of land which is limited and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.310" end="00:23:41.430" style="s2">basically proposes a I will say a single</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.470" end="00:23:45.570" style="s2">fix for all the ills that we see evolve</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.430" end="00:23:48.270" style="s2">in our our economic structure in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.570" end="00:23:51.560" style="s2">think I am correct in quoting Milton</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.270" end="00:23:55.980" style="s2">Freeman Friedman as</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.560" end="00:23:58.520" style="s2">describing land value taxation as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.980" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">least worst attacks something like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.520" end="00:24:03.750" style="s2">least worst yeah well he wasn&#39;t a fan of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.730" style="s2">taxation yeah point is even Milton</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.750" end="00:24:08.370" style="s2">Friedman recognized that there was</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.730" end="00:24:11.580" style="s2">something attacks worse in the way land</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.370" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">functioned and so anyway I would say I</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.580" end="00:24:15.900" style="s2">am not completely compelled by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:18.060" style="s2">georgians that we have a fix that we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.900" end="00:24:19.980" style="s2">derive from a single shift a massive</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.060" end="00:24:22.860" style="s2">shift in the way we collect revenue but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.980" end="00:24:24.540" style="s2">I would say you will you will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.860" end="00:24:26.130" style="s2">delighted if you are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.540" end="00:24:27.810" style="s2">people who have a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.130" end="00:24:30.780" style="s2">perspective to which there is a great</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.810" end="00:24:33.210" style="s2">deal and you want a a proper argument</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.780" end="00:24:35.460" style="s2">about a simple solution to a set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.210" end="00:24:37.110" style="s2">complex problems this is a place to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.460" end="00:24:42.450" style="s2">check out check out the George&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.110" end="00:24:44.520" style="s2">George&#39;s I&#39;m also closely related and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.450" end="00:24:47.730" style="s2">actually probably closer to my belief</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.520" end="00:24:52.230" style="s2">system are the pigouvian s-- so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.730" end="00:24:54.900" style="s2">pigouvian taxes are taxes that take</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.230" end="00:24:56.970" style="s2">externalities and return them to their</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.900" end="00:24:58.710" style="s2">proper owners so to the extent that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.970" end="00:25:01.050" style="s2">are creating pollution that harms people</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.710" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">the point is your text should return</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.050" end="00:25:04.500" style="s2">those costs to you and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:07.680" style="s2">corrective mechanism that I believe is</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.500" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">as close to a single solution to all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.680" end="00:25:11.430" style="s2">our biggest problems as exists now I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.920" style="s2">don&#39;t vote while not yet being anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.430" end="00:25:16.680" style="s2">close to operational it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.920" end="00:25:18.150" style="s2">operationalize yes but from my new tax</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.680" end="00:25:21.660" style="s2">is inherently something that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.150" end="00:25:23.550" style="s2">be operational right but let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.660" end="00:25:25.230" style="s2">do it as a thought experiment oh you</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.390" end="00:26:56.600" style="s2">Asian women I mean it is a big place but</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.890" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">let&#39;s just say you would expect the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.600" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">valence on the decision-making and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">fact what you find oh no that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.490" end="00:27:05.530" style="s2">that&#39;s an ungenerous interpretation of</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.530" end="00:27:10.850" style="s2">beauty standards does not presume that</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.850" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">it Asia which obviously is not a single</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.289" end="00:27:15.500" style="s2">population has the same beauty snares</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:17.630" style="s2">for men and women has the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.500" end="00:27:19.460" style="s2">expectations of what is beauty and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.630" end="00:27:23.900" style="s2">and such oh that&#39;s not what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.460" end="00:27:28.370" style="s2">what I mean is that you do find</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.900" end="00:27:31.549" style="s2">something like sexual racism less so now</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.370" end="00:27:32.929" style="s2">but sexual racism against let&#39;s say far</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.549" end="00:27:34.460" style="s2">Asian leave you just use that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.929" end="00:27:40.630" style="s2">what sexual racism</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.460" end="00:27:43.190" style="s2">okay well sexual selectivity by</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.630" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">population against men in the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.190" end="00:27:48.340" style="s2">population where women are fetishized</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">yeah okay now that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.340" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">evolutionary phenomenon and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.860" end="00:27:55.880" style="s2">want to know how close what&#39;s the spices</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2">dig there but the fetishization of for</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.880" end="00:28:01.820" style="s2">instance East Asian women yep is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:04.220" style="s2">not mostly by European and European</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.820" end="00:28:07.880" style="s2">descended men or is there a Federation</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.220" end="00:28:10.070" style="s2">of I mean I do dude this is crazy</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.880" end="00:28:13.250" style="s2">conversation but you know do do South</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.070" end="00:28:15.350" style="s2">American men fetish sighs East Asian</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.250" end="00:28:18.049" style="s2">women and you know and if so is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.350" end="00:28:21.320" style="s2">again harkening back to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.049" end="00:28:23.270" style="s2">something that emerges out of European</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.320" end="00:28:26.029" style="s2">ethos that describes something</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.270" end="00:28:27.500" style="s2">underlying I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.029" end="00:28:29.330" style="s2">at all is what I&#39;m getting right I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.500" end="00:28:33.130" style="s2">this is I I see that that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.330" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">arguing yeah so first of all we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.130" end="00:28:39.080" style="s2">confound which is it&#39;s very hard to sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:42.529" style="s2">out what is the organic state of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.080" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">prejudice and what is the result of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.529" end="00:28:48.860" style="s2">fact that you know if Asian women are</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:51.409" style="s2">fetishized for some organic reason then</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.860" end="00:28:54.350" style="s2">advertisers figure this out and they use</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.409" end="00:28:57.080" style="s2">it to sell products and let feedback you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.350" end="00:29:00.140" style="s2">get positive here my point is you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.080" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">as you and I have seen repeatedly in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.140" end="00:29:06.250" style="s2">Central and South America our beauty</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:11.390" style="s2">standards get broadcast by companies</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.250" end="00:29:13.730" style="s2">into Latin America and so you know no</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.390" end="00:29:14.990" style="s2">it&#39;s actually I mean no you could a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.730" end="00:29:16.730" style="s2">of different little rabbit holes here</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.990" end="00:29:18.470" style="s2">but one of the really interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.730" end="00:29:20.570" style="s2">about spending so much time both in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.470" end="00:29:22.309" style="s2">Latin America where you know by the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.570" end="00:29:25.340" style="s2">early 90s when we started going there</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.309" end="00:29:28.429" style="s2">they were already completely immersed</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.340" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">and drenched in in Hollywood and Western</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.429" end="00:29:33.890" style="s2">standards right whereas compare that to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:35.390" style="s2">Madagascar where we both spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.890" end="00:29:38.779" style="s2">time I spent a bit more time than you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.390" end="00:29:40.549" style="s2">did also in the 90s which had almost no</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.779" end="00:29:43.010" style="s2">exposure at all like in fact you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.549" end="00:29:45.110" style="s2">would be if people asked us at all we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.010" end="00:29:46.820" style="s2">were from they would assume we&#39;re French</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.110" end="00:29:50.600" style="s2">because America is just not in their in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.820" end="00:29:53.240" style="s2">their map at all of the world and it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.600" end="00:29:55.610" style="s2">a very very different place to be you</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.240" end="00:29:58.190" style="s2">know the the standards the expectations</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.610" end="00:30:01.490" style="s2">and the beauty standards were very much</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.190" end="00:30:04.399" style="s2">not in in the water in the air there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.490" end="00:30:06.169" style="s2">and so decisions about who was</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.399" end="00:30:10.279" style="s2">attractive and not we&#39;re very different</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.169" end="00:30:12.260" style="s2">yeah they were very different but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.279" end="00:30:13.399" style="s2">confound makes it difficult to know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.260" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">the organic state is in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.399" end="00:30:16.700" style="s2">populations yeah be responding to which</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:18.260" style="s2">prejudices in which populations have</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.700" end="00:30:20.059" style="s2">picked up a prejudice because their</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.260" end="00:30:22.330" style="s2">media is broadcasting and even if they</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.059" end="00:30:25.640" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have arrived there themselves I</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.330" end="00:30:27.620" style="s2">guess I just don&#39;t think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.640" end="00:30:29.870" style="s2">you I think you respond to the question</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.620" end="00:30:31.670" style="s2">by saying absolutely not I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.870" end="00:30:34.460" style="s2">that the idea of Western beauties</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.670" end="00:30:37.700" style="s2">is itself wrong you are just saying you</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.460" end="00:30:40.790" style="s2">okay but those standards are based on</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.700" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">something that is more fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.790" end="00:30:46.220" style="s2">I&#39;m not claiming it&#39;s moral or or nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:48.650" style="s2">but that is based on something that goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.220" end="00:30:50.750" style="s2">deeper than just it&#39;s not arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.650" end="00:30:52.730" style="s2">this you know this again is is the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.750" end="00:30:54.290" style="s2">that we make over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.730" end="00:30:56.930" style="s2">again and this in this book that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.290" end="00:30:58.640" style="s2">working on that you know culture boy</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.930" end="00:31:01.790" style="s2">cultural anthropology went off the rails</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.640" end="00:31:04.400" style="s2">in the mid 20th century in part with</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.790" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">clifford geertz who was arguing in what</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.400" end="00:31:10.100" style="s2">1960 70s that culture is arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:12.140" style="s2">that therefore you can do all of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.100" end="00:31:14.500" style="s2">work in cultural anthropology with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.140" end="00:31:17.240" style="s2">assumption that what one culture does</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.500" end="00:31:19.160" style="s2">could just as easily been what another</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.240" end="00:31:22.270" style="s2">culture does and and no that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.160" end="00:31:25.430" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong culture evolves just like</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.270" end="00:31:27.710" style="s2">just like eye color evolves and no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.430" end="00:31:30.860" style="s2">different mechanisms culture is not</p>

<p begin="00:31:54.020" end="00:31:58.430" style="s2">means we can change stuff in one</p>

<p begin="00:32:15.560" end="00:32:18.380" style="s2">would love advice on how to succeed in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.910" end="00:32:20.540" style="s2">the system that doesn&#39;t work well for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.380" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">and you have any recommendations for</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.540" end="00:32:24.980" style="s2">grad schools to teach in a unique way</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:28.010" style="s2">well to the final question no they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.980" end="00:32:31.400" style="s2">all disappeared unfortunately yeah no we</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.010" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">in some ways even the grad school that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.400" end="00:32:37.340" style="s2">worked for me is largely no more yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:40.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.340" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">well before you answer that first one to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.460" end="00:32:43.809" style="s2">the second question what I used to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:46.149" style="s2">advise our</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.809" end="00:32:48.219" style="s2">my students are students when they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.149" end="00:32:49.450" style="s2">considering going to grad school was at</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.219" end="00:32:52.179" style="s2">least within the scientist I know less</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.450" end="00:32:54.729" style="s2">about what goes on in economics that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.179" end="00:32:56.950" style="s2">most grad schools now you apply</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.729" end="00:32:58.719" style="s2">basically to be working under someone in</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.950" end="00:33:00.369" style="s2">their lab working on their questions so</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.719" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">you end up basically with a degree that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.369" end="00:33:03.429" style="s2">makes you a glorified lab tech you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:04.779" style="s2">you&#39;ve you&#39;ve answered someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.429" end="00:33:06.129" style="s2">questions that they have posed but their</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.779" end="00:33:08.169" style="s2">hypotheses their predictions their</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.129" end="00:33:09.759" style="s2">methods and maybe you get to do a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.169" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">troubleshooting of the methods along the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.759" end="00:33:14.109" style="s2">way but that&#39;s what you get your degree</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.729" style="s2">for that so you get a PhD for my doctor</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.109" end="00:33:18.700" style="s2">and philosophy for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.729" end="00:33:21.789" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous whereas at Michigan at</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.700" end="00:33:24.909" style="s2">least when we were there they had yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.789" end="00:33:26.769" style="s2">and that the the negative version of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.909" end="00:33:28.419" style="s2">what they had was it was sink or swim</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.769" end="00:33:30.489" style="s2">you know I had a tremendous attrition</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.419" end="00:33:32.739" style="s2">right you know half half of many of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.489" end="00:33:34.809" style="s2">entering classes of PhD students at</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.739" end="00:33:37.769" style="s2">Michigan failed out within the first few</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.809" end="00:33:41.409" style="s2">years including I think our cohort</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.769" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">because you didn&#39;t just walk into you</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.409" end="00:33:46.359" style="s2">know you had to you didn&#39;t go in and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:48.249" style="s2">work with someone else who had done the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.359" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">thinking for you you had to generate</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.249" end="00:33:51.789" style="s2">your own ideas your own hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.889" style="s2">figure out your own in our case you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.789" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">fieldwork you know cite and hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.889" end="00:33:57.759" style="s2">and you know everything and that meant</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:33:59.529" style="s2">when you got to the end of it you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.759" end="00:34:02.379" style="s2">actually do in to do science because</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.529" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve done science and compare that to</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.379" end="00:34:07.089" style="s2">a model in which it&#39;s easier it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">predictable given that graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.089" end="00:34:11.230" style="s2">are effectively really cheap labor for</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:13.059" style="s2">these universities and these pis these</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.230" end="00:34:14.529" style="s2">principal investigators it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.059" end="00:34:15.579" style="s2">reliable to make sure that once you let</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.529" end="00:34:17.169" style="s2">them in they&#39;re going to be around for</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.579" end="00:34:19.419" style="s2">five seven nine years however long it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.169" end="00:34:22.029" style="s2">but if what you&#39;re actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.419" end="00:34:24.970" style="s2">is generate free thinking independent</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.029" end="00:34:26.919" style="s2">thinking scientists you want a school</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.970" end="00:34:28.659" style="s2">that does not force you to slot into</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.919" end="00:34:30.700" style="s2">someone else&#39;s lab and stay there no</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.659" end="00:34:33.069" style="s2">matter what you know it&#39;s harder and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.700" end="00:34:35.260" style="s2">harder to find yeah Michigan&#39;s program</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.069" end="00:34:37.510" style="s2">was evolutionary in more ways than one</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:38.980" style="s2">you know it used selection to find the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.510" end="00:34:40.839" style="s2">people who could do the thing and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.980" end="00:34:43.720" style="s2">do them how to do it and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.839" end="00:34:46.539" style="s2">can&#39;t fault it entirely it does work</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.720" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">yeah but but it&#39;s also less like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.539" end="00:34:51.460" style="s2">now you know that you have to do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:52.809" style="s2">have to go in under someone and probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.460" end="00:34:54.069" style="s2">you can switch but then it&#39;s hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.809" end="00:34:56.139" style="s2">so and you sort of have this stigma</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.069" end="00:34:56.720" style="s2">attached but to the to the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.139" end="00:34:59.630" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.720" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">you know advice on how to succeed if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.630" end="00:35:04.339" style="s2">don&#39;t if school doesn&#39;t like you well I</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:06.140" style="s2">mean you know Eric and I had very</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.339" end="00:35:13.430" style="s2">different experiences</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.140" end="00:35:16.670" style="s2">I found an advisor who saw my my work as</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.430" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">valuable and was willing to do what was</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.670" end="00:35:22.280" style="s2">necessary to in the end battle all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:24.020" style="s2">way through am I getting my degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.280" end="00:35:25.670" style="s2">Eric faced something very different so</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.020" end="00:35:27.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I can say oh do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.670" end="00:35:30.170" style="s2">because you may not be able to do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.290" end="00:35:33.349" style="s2">but if you can I would say finding the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.170" end="00:35:35.180" style="s2">people who understand what you&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.349" end="00:35:36.890" style="s2">and why you should be there and are</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.180" end="00:35:41.869" style="s2">willing to go to bat for you is</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.890" end="00:35:43.760" style="s2">important and I would say make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.869" end="00:35:45.140" style="s2">you you&#39;re doing what you need to do if</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.760" end="00:35:46.310" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be there because the thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.140" end="00:35:48.829" style="s2">that you really want to do in life</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.310" end="00:35:53.210" style="s2">requires you to be there then do so but</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.829" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">don&#39;t kid yourself these systems they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.210" end="00:35:57.950" style="s2">not produce people in the expectation</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">that there will be jobs they produce</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.950" end="00:36:01.550" style="s2">people knowing that there will not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:03.109" style="s2">jobs except for a very few and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:06.020" style="s2">decide who&#39;s going to get the jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.109" end="00:36:07.849" style="s2">if you&#39;re not their designated person</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.020" end="00:36:10.339" style="s2">then you&#39;re liable to find that your</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.849" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">degree was in large measure or waste so</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.339" end="00:36:17.329" style="s2">think carefully about what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:19.099" style="s2">next question are you concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.329" end="00:36:21.140" style="s2">reports of bubonic plague in Colorado</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.099" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">and a new virus or illness in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.140" end="00:36:27.589" style="s2">Central Asian states I think we</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:29.900" style="s2">mentioned the plague in the last one or</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.589" end="00:36:31.369" style="s2">two of these I actually have not seen</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.900" end="00:36:35.170" style="s2">anything in the last week or so about</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.369" end="00:36:37.790" style="s2">either of these but you know the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.170" end="00:36:41.240" style="s2">highly transmissible potentially deadly</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.790" end="00:36:43.640" style="s2">disease is obviously not a a small one</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.240" end="00:36:45.890" style="s2">but with regard to plague we actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.640" end="00:36:48.410" style="s2">have treatment for plague you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.890" end="00:36:52.609" style="s2">you have doxycycline is treatment for</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.410" end="00:36:54.290" style="s2">plague and it&#39;s been the treatment for</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.609" end="00:36:57.140" style="s2">plague for a long time plague was in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.290" end="00:36:58.220" style="s2">Madagascar when leave so when I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.140" end="00:37:01.010" style="s2">there I think one of the times you were</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.220" end="00:37:02.540" style="s2">there with me and just having you know a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.010" end="00:37:04.579" style="s2">lot of doxy on hand</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.540" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">in case you got infected was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.579" end="00:37:10.359" style="s2">treatment yeah we never ran into it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">we see no evidence that the that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.359" end="00:37:15.230" style="s2">evolving away from that drug in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:18.619" style="s2">the drugs efficacy so it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.230" end="00:37:21.079" style="s2">terrifying because we all have some</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.619" end="00:37:22.700" style="s2">enough history to know what Europe</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.079" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2">looked like in the in the second</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.700" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">millennium but but it&#39;s that particular</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:29.300" style="s2">thing is probably not a major deal and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:31.310" style="s2">don&#39;t remember exactly what the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.300" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">thing emerging in Central Asia is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.310" end="00:37:36.859" style="s2">think it was a new flu strain of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">troubling kind but I haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.859" end="00:37:44.300" style="s2">anything h1n1 well that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:46.550" style="s2">frightening yep because you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.300" end="00:37:49.880" style="s2">thing about viruses is they reduce their</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.550" end="00:37:51.410" style="s2">machinery to almost nothing and in so</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.880" end="00:37:52.700" style="s2">doing they make it hard to fight them</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.410" end="00:37:53.930" style="s2">because you can&#39;t attack their machinery</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.700" end="00:37:56.990" style="s2">because it&#39;s your machinery they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.930" end="00:37:58.760" style="s2">borrowing it so yeah I&#39;m more concerned</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.990" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">about about the virus on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.760" end="00:38:05.180" style="s2">on the positive side we have now across</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:06.470" style="s2">the entire planet had a proper or at</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.180" end="00:38:09.230" style="s2">least the beginning of a proper</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.470" end="00:38:11.960" style="s2">conversation about epidemiology and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.230" end="00:38:18.260" style="s2">to prevent viruses from being spread hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.960" end="00:38:20.660" style="s2">and so my guess is even if h1n1 takes a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.260" end="00:38:25.910" style="s2">takes hold that we will have an easier</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.660" end="00:38:28.069" style="s2">time fending it off I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.910" end="00:38:30.410" style="s2">understand this question what do you</p>

<p begin="00:38:59.900" end="00:39:03.640" style="s2">a general sense we would be in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.819" end="00:39:08.210" style="s2">this I</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.640" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">I like the ethos that if you can&#39;t open</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.210" end="00:39:13.310" style="s2">it you don&#39;t own it and in lots of ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:15.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t really own our phones you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.310" end="00:39:17.690" style="s2">we rent our phones and they parasitize</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.800" end="00:39:19.550" style="s2">us and it&#39;s not a fair relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.690" end="00:39:20.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not symmetrical and we see this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.550" end="00:39:23.780" style="s2">lots of things that aren&#39;t inherently</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.510" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">phone based you know we we obviously are</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:31.940" style="s2">makes decisions about whether the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:33.650" style="s2">content we are putting out is suitable</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.940" end="00:39:35.780" style="s2">for its advertisers you know what they</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.650" end="00:39:37.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t like the black intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.780" end="00:39:39.710" style="s2">roundtable act you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.010" end="00:39:42.230" style="s2">something ties them because offensive I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.710" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know danger dangerous I would the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.230" end="00:39:47.600" style="s2">dangerous No</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:51.110" style="s2">so anyway the algorithm delivers a but</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.600" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">they have unsafety monetize that since</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.110" end="00:39:54.350" style="s2">you I think so although I&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:57.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen them wobble in the past my</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.350" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">guess is what goes on is an algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.400" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">looks at the language or something and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.900" end="00:40:04.670" style="s2">if you&#39;re in territory that it finds it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:06.350" style="s2">all sensitive it did it punishes you for</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.670" end="00:40:07.940" style="s2">making the content which is insane right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.350" end="00:40:09.170" style="s2">because this is exactly the content you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.940" end="00:40:13.520" style="s2">want in order to make the world less</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.170" end="00:40:15.260" style="s2">dangerous so anyway I am going to policy</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.520" end="00:40:17.570" style="s2">proposal this is not affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.260" end="00:40:18.830" style="s2">unity 2020 I think no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.570" end="00:40:21.470" style="s2">happens there we have to do this other</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.830" end="00:40:23.810" style="s2">thing which is artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.470" end="00:40:25.720" style="s2">that&#39;s the category we&#39;re shooting for</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.810" end="00:40:29.900" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got is artificial stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.720" end="00:40:33.830" style="s2">so Google that&#39;s what you&#39;ve achieved</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.900" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">and thank you for it I guess but could</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.800" end="00:42:01.320" style="s2">oh yeah here&#39;s the thing there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.860" end="00:42:03.330" style="s2">cruddy thing that we call school and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.320" end="00:42:06.750" style="s2">then there&#39;s what school should be and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.330" end="00:42:09.900" style="s2">here&#39;s the key thing right civilization</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.750" end="00:42:12.990" style="s2">is squandering human potential which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.900" end="00:42:15.810" style="s2">despicable right a human is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.990" end="00:42:18.690" style="s2">the most marvelous feats of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.810" end="00:42:21.720" style="s2">and insight and innovation and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.690" end="00:42:24.420" style="s2">take this spectacular creature and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.720" end="00:42:26.490" style="s2">set it to the most mundane garbage right</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.420" end="00:42:28.140" style="s2">we just waste everybody&#39;s time like not</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.490" end="00:42:31.500" style="s2">just most of it all of it we waste</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.140" end="00:42:34.620" style="s2">entire lives we we cripple people by</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.500" end="00:42:36.780" style="s2">exposing them to cruddy lessons that</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.620" end="00:42:39.150" style="s2">don&#39;t cause them to be able to more be</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.780" end="00:42:42.480" style="s2">more capable as adults it causes them to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.150" end="00:42:45.600" style="s2">be only capable of cog like behavior so</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.480" end="00:42:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what school is school should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.600" end="00:42:49.770" style="s2">the thing that figures out what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.310" end="00:42:51.210" style="s2">limits of human capacity are we should</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.770" end="00:42:53.310" style="s2">be moving in that direction we should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.210" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">discovering what school looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.310" end="00:42:57.090" style="s2">so if you hear us ranting and railing</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:59.940" style="s2">against school it&#39;s not because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.090" end="00:43:02.370" style="s2">value what should be in that category</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.940" end="00:43:03.870" style="s2">it&#39;s that we resent the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.370" end="00:43:06.300" style="s2">squandering of human potential that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.870" end="00:43:10.500" style="s2">actually happens which is immense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.300" end="00:43:13.470" style="s2">you know it&#39;s true that school is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.500" end="00:43:15.990" style="s2">Universal in humans but learning is and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.470" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">so one of the things that we speak to is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.990" end="00:43:23.670" style="s2">the idea that we have been handed</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.250" end="00:43:24.869" style="s2">a false equivalency in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.670" end="00:43:26.099" style="s2">basically told don&#39;t you want your</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.869" end="00:43:27.300" style="s2">children to learn well then they have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.099" end="00:43:29.849" style="s2">do it in school because where else could</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.300" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">they possibly learn and that&#39;s school</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.849" end="00:43:33.690" style="s2">and learning aren&#39;t the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:35.430" style="s2">that said school done well is frankly</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.690" end="00:43:36.840" style="s2">what we were doing we were professional</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.430" end="00:43:39.480" style="s2">educators for fifteen years</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.840" end="00:43:42.540" style="s2">never having expected to to go into that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.480" end="00:43:44.010" style="s2">right and to this you know this book</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.540" end="00:43:46.410" style="s2">that I read from the last hour this</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.010" end="00:43:48.810" style="s2">weapons of mass instruction the subtitle</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.410" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">is is school teachers journey through</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.810" end="00:43:54.349" style="s2">the dark world of compulsory schooling</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">so again you know this this author who</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.349" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">again rants and raves about the failures</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:01.890" style="s2">of school himself also dedicated himself</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:05.250" style="s2">for you know at least twice as long</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.890" end="00:44:08.369" style="s2">maybe more than than we did to educating</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.250" end="00:44:11.310" style="s2">Minds younger than his while still</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.369" end="00:44:15.470" style="s2">recognizing exactly where the failings</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.310" end="00:44:18.320" style="s2">in the system were so it&#39;s tough because</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.470" end="00:44:22.140" style="s2">compulsory schooling is pretty broken</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.320" end="00:44:23.970" style="s2">but there it&#39;s it&#39;s also it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.140" end="00:44:25.589" style="s2">difficult to do anything else you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.970" end="00:44:27.990" style="s2">some of our most remarkable and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.589" end="00:44:30.720" style="s2">unexpected and brilliant students had</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.990" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">been homeschooled or unschooled at</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.720" end="00:44:34.890" style="s2">Evergreen but that takes something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">takes a lot actually on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.890" end="00:44:40.020" style="s2">family and the parents and the kid and</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:42.300" style="s2">most families just can&#39;t marriage that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.020" end="00:44:43.980" style="s2">either of those things so every time we</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.300" end="00:44:45.810" style="s2">say this is what we were doing I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.980" end="00:44:47.849" style="s2">it is important to say there were two</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.810" end="00:44:50.369" style="s2">things necessary for us to do what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.849" end="00:44:52.770" style="s2">were doing one was complete freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.369" end="00:44:54.630" style="s2">do whatever we needed to do that freedom</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.770" end="00:44:56.190" style="s2">was a disaster in other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.630" end="00:44:59.849" style="s2">college because it let people do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.190" end="00:45:01.260" style="s2">right so the jobs were too easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.849" end="00:45:02.940" style="s2">they weren&#39;t easy to get but they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.260" end="00:45:04.770" style="s2">too easy to get so we brought in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.940" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">people who were lackluster and then we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.770" end="00:45:08.250" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get rid of them there was no</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:10.380" style="s2">there was no standard by which they</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.250" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">could be judged and so evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.380" end="00:45:16.320" style="s2">accumulated cruddy teachers however if</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:17.910" style="s2">you were there and for your own reasons</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.320" end="00:45:20.550" style="s2">you were motivated to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.910" end="00:45:22.890" style="s2">how best to educate people nobody could</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.550" end="00:45:24.810" style="s2">stop you right there was no compulsory</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.890" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2">education inside of the structure you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.810" end="00:45:28.560" style="s2">could design your own courses and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:32.099" style="s2">could teach them and you had your</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.560" end="00:45:33.660" style="s2">students attention full-time so you had</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.099" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">an incredible</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.660" end="00:45:38.069" style="s2">palette on which to paint and so for</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:40.200" style="s2">those of us like you and me the small</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.069" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">number who were just absolutely driven</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.200" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">to figure out what you could teach given</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:45.720" style="s2">complete freedom it was great</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">and these two things that we separated</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.720" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">but it worked much more effectively for</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:52.170" style="s2">older so not only where we teach in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.029" style="s2">college not k12 but also many of our</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.170" end="00:45:55.470" style="s2">students were older than traditional age</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.029" end="00:45:56.789" style="s2">you know whatever green across the board</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.470" end="00:45:58.740" style="s2">I think the average age of the students</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.789" end="00:46:03.769" style="s2">was 25 or so and we often had students</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.740" end="00:46:06.029" style="s2">our age or older and so we had a palette</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.769" end="00:46:08.339" style="s2">that we could share with our students</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.029" end="00:46:11.400" style="s2">and and paint onto a canvas that was</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.339" end="00:46:14.099" style="s2">open as opposed to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.400" end="00:46:15.809" style="s2">paint-by-numbers top-down authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.099" end="00:46:17.809" style="s2">approach that most modern compulsory</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.809" end="00:46:19.950" style="s2">schooling engages in and part of that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.809" end="00:46:22.380" style="s2">little bit of that probably has to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.950" end="00:46:24.269" style="s2">happen because you do need to know how</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.380" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">to write and you&#39;re not going to know</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.269" end="00:46:27.900" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna learn how to write by</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:28.950" style="s2">just hanging out in the forest that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:33.180" style="s2">not where you&#39;re gonna learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.950" end="00:46:37.019" style="s2">write but the the sort of No Child Left</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.019" end="00:46:41.490" style="s2">and the standardized testing and the</p>

<p begin="00:46:41.490" end="00:46:46.440" style="s2">curriculum - teaching - and then the</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.440" end="00:46:51.420" style="s2">tests that are now taking up so much</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.180" end="00:46:54.210" style="s2">time of children is rendering teachers</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.420" end="00:46:56.910" style="s2">unable to do the kind of work that even</p>

<p begin="00:46:56.910" end="00:47:02.420" style="s2">be able to do had they a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.559" end="00:47:06.329" style="s2">freedom to actually do their jobs yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.420" end="00:47:09.000" style="s2">also as great as it is to do that job at</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.329" end="00:47:10.170" style="s2">the level of college it is really</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.000" end="00:47:14.130" style="s2">important that we start doing the job</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.170" end="00:47:16.049" style="s2">for the youngest kids because the longer</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.130" end="00:47:20.460" style="s2">you wait the harder it is to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.049" end="00:47:22.769" style="s2">resurrect an awake mind yep okay this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.460" end="00:47:26.759" style="s2">question is about biology hash tag</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.920" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">the ideas heresy and results in</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.690" end="00:47:35.759" style="s2">excommunication it appears to the right</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.619" style="s2">to the question asker that invasive</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.759" end="00:47:40.500" style="s2">species are opportunistic species and a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.619" end="00:47:42.779" style="s2">point in time is preferred yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.500" end="00:47:45.539" style="s2">there&#39;s something to this it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.779" end="00:47:47.390" style="s2">kinda yeah sort of kind of let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.539" end="00:47:49.850" style="s2">this way you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.390" end="00:47:52.100" style="s2">take people out of the equation you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.850" end="00:47:54.500" style="s2">got some sort of mechanism that produces</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.100" end="00:47:56.840" style="s2">an equilibrium of species in each</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.500" end="00:48:00.050" style="s2">habitat right so you&#39;ve got a certain</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.840" end="00:48:01.970" style="s2">amount of species migration or a species</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.050" end="00:48:03.950" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t in a habitat finds its way</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.970" end="00:48:05.450" style="s2">into a habitat you&#39;ve got a certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.950" end="00:48:09.050" style="s2">amount of emergence of new species</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.450" end="00:48:11.600" style="s2">through speciation and these things tend</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.050" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">to equilibrate every so often something</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.600" end="00:48:16.070" style="s2">will disperse over a very long distance</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:18.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked about the fact that the only</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.070" end="00:48:21.380" style="s2">mammal that is natively on land in</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.620" end="00:48:23.030" style="s2">Hawaii is a bat okay some point a bat</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.380" end="00:48:25.160" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t in Hawaii got blown off</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.030" end="00:48:26.390" style="s2">course maybe a pregnant bat or maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.160" end="00:48:28.220" style="s2">was a couple bats that were flying</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.390" end="00:48:29.330" style="s2">together that got blown there and it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.220" end="00:48:32.480" style="s2">happened to be a male and a female who</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.330" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">knows but some how about that wasn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.480" end="00:48:36.620" style="s2">Hawaii ended up there is that natural of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:38.420" style="s2">course is it invasive I wouldn&#39;t call it</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.620" end="00:48:41.620" style="s2">that it&#39;s a natural process so when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.420" end="00:48:45.500" style="s2">say invasive what we really mean are</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.620" end="00:48:47.740" style="s2">human transported creatures where we</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.500" end="00:48:49.670" style="s2">have solved a biological problem by</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.740" end="00:48:51.230" style="s2">transporting a creature over a gap that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.670" end="00:48:53.810" style="s2">would not have crossed and that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.230" end="00:48:55.580" style="s2">resulted in it not having to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.810" end="00:48:57.890" style="s2">problem and therefore sometimes being</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.580" end="00:49:00.680" style="s2">competitively superior and driving out</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.890" end="00:49:03.710" style="s2">species that are native so if what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.680" end="00:49:05.510" style="s2">oppose is the human transportation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.710" end="00:49:07.100" style="s2">creatures and therefore solving a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.510" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">problem that they were evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.100" end="00:49:13.160" style="s2">unable to solve on their own then this</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:16.970" style="s2">all makes sense so invasive doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.160" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">migrant it means human driven invasive</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.970" end="00:49:21.110" style="s2">and human driven invasives are often</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.280" end="00:49:23.060" style="s2">competitively superior because they are</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.110" end="00:49:26.300" style="s2">not hamstrung by they need to disperse</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.060" end="00:49:28.100" style="s2">into the habitat and they often don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.300" end="00:49:30.740" style="s2">have competitors or predators or</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.100" end="00:49:33.290" style="s2">parasites within their new habitat that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.740" end="00:49:35.210" style="s2">have millions of years of coevolution</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.290" end="00:49:38.120" style="s2">with them yeah so they are freed from</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.210" end="00:49:40.040" style="s2">any of the constraints of their the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.120" end="00:49:41.600" style="s2">native organisms which they are more</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.040" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">close most closely aligned with niche</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.600" end="00:49:47.120" style="s2">wise so they can move into someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:48.980" style="s2">else&#39;s niche and not suffer the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.120" end="00:49:52.460" style="s2">kind of parasites pathogens competitors</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.980" end="00:49:54.380" style="s2">predators as the native organisms do and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.460" end="00:49:58.220" style="s2">thus have a better chance of taking over</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.380" end="00:50:00.100" style="s2">so the ultimate thing here is if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.220" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">take human transportation</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.100" end="00:50:05.470" style="s2">of creatures out of the equation you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">will get high diversity if humans are</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.470" end="00:50:08.980" style="s2">allowed to transport things willy-nilly</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.030" end="00:50:10.780" style="s2">because we decide invasion it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.980" end="00:50:13.000" style="s2">another natural process you will drive</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.780" end="00:50:14.730" style="s2">diversity through the floor and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.000" end="00:50:17.590" style="s2">reason is because you will find the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.730" end="00:50:19.480" style="s2">superior competitors everywhere and if</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.590" end="00:50:22.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe us look at eucalyptus</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.480" end="00:50:24.670" style="s2">I really wrecking South America in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.360" end="00:50:26.590" style="s2">Portland English ivy English ivy here</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.670" end="00:50:27.970" style="s2">yeah eucalyptus every sack is now</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.590" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">laughing because he knows this is some</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.970" end="00:50:31.930" style="s2">of the beans of my existence yes I go</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:34.030" style="s2">out every week and tear out as much of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.930" end="00:50:36.010" style="s2">the English ivy as I can not because</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.030" end="00:50:38.200" style="s2">when I&#39;m in England I hate ivy but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.010" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">has no business here and it destroys the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.200" end="00:50:41.560" style="s2">huckleberries and the salal and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.030" style="s2">sword ferns and the vine maples and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.560" end="00:50:44.440" style="s2">everything else that would make a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.030" end="00:50:47.050" style="s2">beautiful and productive forest which</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.440" end="00:50:49.360" style="s2">when you take out the ivy you get back</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.050" end="00:50:51.640" style="s2">the creepers and the wrens and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.360" end="00:50:53.770" style="s2">woodpeckers and everything else as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.640" end="00:50:55.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s just the birds yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.770" end="00:50:57.970" style="s2">know English ivy comes in and you end up</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.600" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">with a mono crop that as opposed to an</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.970" end="00:51:06.700" style="s2">actual rich diverse ecosystem okay next</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:08.920" style="s2">so questions now from this live stream</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.700" end="00:51:10.630" style="s2">have you read the critiques of fryers</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.920" end="00:51:12.850" style="s2">and empirical analysis of racial</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.630" end="00:51:14.320" style="s2">differences cited by Harris they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.850" end="00:51:15.640" style="s2">weak but it might be useful to discuss</p>

<p begin="00:54:25.380" end="00:54:32.670" style="s2">oh yeah but I think the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.460" end="00:54:34.830" style="s2">there is no bar to this argument the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.670" end="00:54:35.550" style="s2">reductio ad absurdum is going to be just</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.710" end="00:55:03.260" style="s2">actually I mean there there are some</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.880" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">really horrifying and creepy pedophilia</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.240" end="00:55:20.820" style="s2">what what the heck is this yeah it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.640" end="00:55:25.560" style="s2">yeah reading to you know pre-k kids and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.820" end="00:55:30.990" style="s2">library reading hours sexualized oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.560" end="00:55:32.910" style="s2">oh god yeah okay next up do you think</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.990" end="00:55:34.710" style="s2">that apprenticeship or rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.910" end="00:55:37.410" style="s2">should become more common in the West as</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.710" end="00:55:39.570" style="s2">a lot of men specifically seem to lack</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.410" end="00:55:41.370" style="s2">guidance well I would say a lot of men</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.570" end="00:55:46.380" style="s2">and women seem to lack guidance that</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.370" end="00:55:48.090" style="s2">rites of passage have been not totally</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.380" end="00:55:51.780" style="s2">ubiquitous in every human culture that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.090" end="00:55:53.880" style="s2">has been looked at but nearly so is some</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.780" end="00:55:56.250" style="s2">I mean I I think actually so this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.880" end="00:55:58.020" style="s2">terrific book I kind of I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.250" end="00:56:00.120" style="s2">David last name Brown called human</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.020" end="00:56:02.700" style="s2">universals human universals and which he</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.120" end="00:56:05.430" style="s2">basically tries to assess what are in</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.700" end="00:56:06.960" style="s2">fact some of the many traits that show</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.430" end="00:56:10.680" style="s2">up in every single culture that has been</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.960" end="00:56:12.450" style="s2">looked at and while he says he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.680" end="00:56:13.950" style="s2">quite sure that rites of passage are</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.450" end="00:56:15.630" style="s2">universal I think when I look carefully</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.950" end="00:56:18.720" style="s2">at the data he&#39;s using I would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.630" end="00:56:20.490" style="s2">actually while say you know death ritual</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.720" end="00:56:21.840" style="s2">isn&#39;t totally Universal marriage which</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.490" end="00:56:24.390" style="s2">will doesn&#39;t totally peel birth ritual</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.840" end="00:56:26.220" style="s2">if you if you go across all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.390" end="00:56:28.410" style="s2">rituals coming-of-age being the one that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.220" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">is being alluded to here I think every</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.410" end="00:56:35.100" style="s2">culture does have some kind of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:35.640" style="s2">of ritual for sure but then rites of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.100" end="00:56:38.490" style="s2">passage</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.640" end="00:56:42.060" style="s2">almost all of them do yeah we lost</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.490" end="00:56:44.490" style="s2">something real and graduation from high</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.060" end="00:56:46.740" style="s2">school and for many people going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.490" end="00:56:48.690" style="s2">college and graduating from college used</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.740" end="00:56:49.080" style="s2">to be for you know a couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.690" end="00:56:52.710" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.080" end="00:56:55.980" style="s2">a kind of rite of passage but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.710" end="00:56:58.920" style="s2">not that anymore because it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.980" end="00:57:02.220" style="s2">very much more thing is it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.920" end="00:57:04.680" style="s2">lots in yeah but it has none of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.220" end="00:57:06.360" style="s2">useful characteristics so in any case we</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.680" end="00:57:07.740" style="s2">do make exactly this argument in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.360" end="00:57:10.830" style="s2">book that rites of passage are</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.740" end="00:57:13.530" style="s2">fundamental that their loss breaks an</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.830" end="00:57:16.350" style="s2">important phenomenon and that something</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.530" end="00:57:18.690" style="s2">needs to take its place I mean and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.350" end="00:57:20.640" style="s2">a perfect test in Spence situation where</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.690" end="00:57:22.020" style="s2">you may not be able to pay exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.640" end="00:57:24.750" style="s2">the rite of passage does and you may say</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.020" end="00:57:27.150" style="s2">it&#39;s archaic but if you eliminate it</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.750" end="00:57:29.130" style="s2">then you discover that oh hey why are</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.150" end="00:57:30.540" style="s2">there no adults yeah hey I wonder I</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.130" end="00:57:32.610" style="s2">wonder why I wonder why there are no</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.540" end="00:57:34.140" style="s2">adults and apprenticeship absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.610" end="00:57:36.510" style="s2">mean there there are some kinds of work</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.140" end="00:57:39.390" style="s2">that really just mandate apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.510" end="00:57:41.580" style="s2">and we&#39;re losing it nearly across the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.390" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">board and then you might argue that even</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.580" end="00:57:45.570" style="s2">that kind of work that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.370" style="s2">necessarily require apprenticeship might</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.570" end="00:57:50.100" style="s2">benefit from it both from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.370" end="00:57:51.720" style="s2">perspective of the master and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.100" end="00:57:54.540" style="s2">apprentice yeah it&#39;s great for some</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.720" end="00:57:56.490" style="s2">things carpentry for example not so good</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.540" end="00:57:58.230" style="s2">for sorcerers it can cause a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.490" end="00:58:01.560" style="s2">trouble yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.100" end="00:58:27.210" style="s2">and can be struck down to commit</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:32.430" style="s2">we we mentioned we talked about this a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.990" end="00:58:34.200" style="s2">little bit a few episodes back I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.430" end="00:58:34.950" style="s2">think we identified it by I did by the</p>

<p begin="00:58:34.950" end="00:58:39.840" style="s2">yeah but prop 16 on the California</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.050" end="00:58:41.550" style="s2">ballot so yeah I mean it it should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.840" end="00:58:43.290" style="s2">pretty clear to people who follow us</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.550" end="00:58:46.940" style="s2">what we&#39;re likely to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.290" end="00:58:50.220" style="s2">which is that this is you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.940" end="00:58:51.930" style="s2">very leading edge of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.220" end="00:58:54.300" style="s2">about to overwhelm us which is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.930" end="00:58:56.730" style="s2">these positive discrimination which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.300" end="00:58:59.250" style="s2">of course not positive in any useful</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.730" end="00:59:01.530" style="s2">sense of that term is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.250" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">installed into every system both</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.530" end="00:59:04.940" style="s2">formally and in</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.940" end="00:59:13.640" style="s2">apart as a result so yeah bad really as</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.760" end="00:59:18.830" style="s2">bad as it could be and you know will</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:25.910" style="s2">they do there is a fair amount of work</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.650" end="01:00:27.350" style="s2">now on different types of UV and how</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.910" end="01:00:28.730" style="s2">effective they are but I think even the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.350" end="01:00:32.300" style="s2">ones that are least effective are still</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.730" end="01:00:33.740" style="s2">effective enough to be useful so yes yes</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.330" end="01:00:57.560" style="s2">yeah safety third as I once said to</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.640" end="01:01:01.250" style="s2">students things you could regret saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.560" end="01:01:04.760" style="s2">in court yes yes yes it was a day in</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.250" end="01:01:07.310" style="s2">which no one almost died so I was it</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.760" end="01:01:10.040" style="s2">worked out yeah you guys don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.310" end="01:01:11.780" style="s2">consciousness you know you guys don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.040" end="01:01:14.690" style="s2">think conscious awareness is fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.780" end="01:01:15.890" style="s2">but without it nothing would matter do</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.690" end="01:01:16.850" style="s2">you really think a universe in which</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.890" end="01:01:19.070" style="s2">nothing matters could</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.850" end="01:01:22.490" style="s2">could spontaneously produce the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.070" end="01:01:24.950" style="s2">to matter they think you&#39;ve completely</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.490" end="01:01:28.370" style="s2">must understood our position conscious</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.950" end="01:01:29.570" style="s2">oh well it&#39;s it&#39;s fundamental okay so it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.370" end="01:01:30.440" style="s2">depends on what you mean by fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.570" end="01:01:31.730" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple of different</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.440" end="01:01:36.650" style="s2">meanings in the word fundamental here</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.730" end="01:01:39.650" style="s2">yes it matter humans wouldn&#39;t be humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.650" end="01:01:41.510" style="s2">without consciousness but the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.650" end="01:01:43.850" style="s2">consciousness is fundamental and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.510" end="01:01:48.290" style="s2">item that it came before it matter</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.850" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s primary is is the thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.290" end="01:01:53.000" style="s2">say no yeah that&#39;s pen psychism and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:55.580" style="s2">no that doesn&#39;t work that&#39;s what makes</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.000" end="01:01:58.940" style="s2">sense or even even just before creatures</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.580" end="01:02:01.880" style="s2">would be absurd so I think you have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.940" end="01:02:04.070" style="s2">couple of what Daniel Dennett calls</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.880" end="01:02:06.410" style="s2">deputies in here weird I think this</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.070" end="01:02:08.210" style="s2">actually may be tongue-in-cheek this</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.410" end="01:02:10.310" style="s2">question somebody&#39;s messing with us yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.210" end="01:02:11.570" style="s2">all right well it&#39;s good it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.310" end="01:02:12.560" style="s2">through the green who&#39;s who&#39;s asked</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.570" end="01:02:14.030" style="s2">questions for do you really think</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.560" end="01:02:16.130" style="s2">University much nothing yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.030" end="01:02:18.530" style="s2">he&#39;s exactly playing was a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.130" end="01:02:19.400" style="s2">in matter here alright well he feels me</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.530" end="01:02:22.130" style="s2">and me too</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.400" end="01:02:23.630" style="s2">okay yeah fair enough we&#39;re up though</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.130" end="01:02:25.880" style="s2">why don&#39;t you answer it in good fun I</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.630" end="01:02:28.280" style="s2">was going to argue the panel I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.880" end="01:02:33.320" style="s2">there are two deputies in that statement</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.280" end="01:02:37.880" style="s2">a Dipity being a term that shifts</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.320" end="01:02:45.380" style="s2">meaning inside of a claim that results</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.880" end="01:02:49.220" style="s2">in a false paradox so what is the famous</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.380" end="01:02:51.140" style="s2">example I can&#39;t remember I don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.220" end="01:02:54.050" style="s2">has to do with has to do with love being</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.140" end="01:02:56.030" style="s2">just a word and the idea is that love is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.050" end="01:02:58.190" style="s2">actually a phenomenon but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.030" end="01:03:00.890" style="s2">word and so if you slide between those</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.190" end="01:03:02.540" style="s2">two meanings you can create logical</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.890" end="01:03:04.850" style="s2">problems yeah so anyway I think matter</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.540" end="01:03:07.970" style="s2">and matter mm-hmm is playing that role</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.850" end="01:03:09.800" style="s2">yeah yeah okay and fundamental to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.970" end="01:03:12.710" style="s2">just not sliding actively within this</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.800" end="01:03:15.680" style="s2">framing does the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.710" end="01:03:17.720" style="s2">less Y chromosomes than Metin explained</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.680" end="01:03:19.400" style="s2">behaviors like group rape where Y has</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.720" end="01:03:22.700" style="s2">the probability to be passed even if</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.400" end="01:03:27.080" style="s2">without the rest of the genome is group</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.700" end="01:03:28.470" style="s2">rape more probable if the Y is shared</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.080" end="01:03:30.420" style="s2">within the group</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.470" end="01:03:35.100" style="s2">this is asked by a woman incidentally</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.420" end="01:03:39.750" style="s2">which at least changes my yes last part</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.100" end="01:03:42.090" style="s2">of the question is possible yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.750" end="01:03:46.290" style="s2">never thought of it before but it would</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.090" end="01:03:50.190" style="s2">have to be triggered by the y-chromosome</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.290" end="01:03:53.070" style="s2">carrying sequences that would function</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.190" end="01:03:54.930" style="s2">in their own interest mm-hmm which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.070" end="01:03:56.670" style="s2">unlikely given the nature of Y</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.930" end="01:03:57.780" style="s2">chromosomes that we actually find in</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.670" end="01:03:58.920" style="s2">other words it may be why the Y</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.780" end="01:04:02.490" style="s2">chromosomes have been genetically</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.920" end="01:04:04.940" style="s2">largely shut down but anyway it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.490" end="01:04:10.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not impossible that such a thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.940" end="01:04:13.440" style="s2">could evolve although I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.890" end="01:04:15.540" style="s2">question is why why is the Y crime if</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.440" end="01:04:18.300" style="s2">the Y chromosome is shared then it</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.540" end="01:04:20.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really have an interest in more</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.300" end="01:04:24.300" style="s2">than one male participating and their</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.370" end="01:04:25.530" style="s2">mating unless by the way in order for</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.300" end="01:04:26.790" style="s2">this to be an acceptable thing for us to</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.530" end="01:04:29.610" style="s2">be discussing I think we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.790" end="01:04:29.970" style="s2">discussing insects or something like</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.610" end="01:04:33.660" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.970" end="01:04:35.310" style="s2">okay which of course don&#39;t have yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.660" end="01:04:39.420" style="s2">was almost sex determination yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.310" end="01:04:41.670" style="s2">Duval&#39;s all right voles it is sorry</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.420" end="01:04:44.400" style="s2">voles if there any voles watching</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.670" end="01:04:45.120" style="s2">we apologize I&#39;m not apologizing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.400" end="01:04:47.580" style="s2">voles</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.120" end="01:04:49.470" style="s2">it must be later than the podcast we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.580" end="01:04:50.610" style="s2">gotten to whether or not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.470" end="01:04:53.550" style="s2">apologizing to voles</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.610" end="01:04:55.620" style="s2">yeah so the question is what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.550" end="01:04:57.540" style="s2">advantage to the chromosome of getting</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.620" end="01:05:00.690" style="s2">more than one male involved it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.540" end="01:05:04.410" style="s2">obvious to me that there is one yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.690" end="01:05:06.390" style="s2">could such a thing emerge evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.410" end="01:05:08.700" style="s2">yes if there was a sequence carried on</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.390" end="01:05:09.900" style="s2">the y chromosome that could advance its</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.700" end="01:05:13.050" style="s2">own interest in this way there of course</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.900" end="01:05:15.360" style="s2">lots of other systems that have the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.050" end="01:05:22.440" style="s2">nature but not the same mechanism of</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.280" end="01:05:42.940" style="s2">think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.740" end="01:05:45.340" style="s2">kind of the model for what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.940" end="01:05:51.820" style="s2">looking for here yeah sorry my</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.340" end="01:05:57.310" style="s2">interesting question next okay let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.820" end="01:05:58.990" style="s2">a few more someone is saying again as we</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.310" end="01:06:00.610" style="s2">talked about the end of the last live</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.990" end="01:06:01.990" style="s2">stream Barry Weiss resigned from the New</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.610" end="01:06:02.500" style="s2">York Times because it was a hostile work</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.990" end="01:06:04.869" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.500" end="01:06:07.810" style="s2">owing to political orthodoxy yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.869" end="01:06:09.520" style="s2">that&#39;s very much it next question</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.810" end="01:06:11.590" style="s2">well actually as long as they were on</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.520" end="01:06:13.330" style="s2">that topic here&#39;s the hostile work</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.590" end="01:06:15.010" style="s2">environment that&#39;s illegal</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.330" end="01:06:17.400" style="s2">the employer has an obligation to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.010" end="01:06:19.780" style="s2">correct that now here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.400" end="01:06:21.160" style="s2">would a court be able to hear that</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.780" end="01:06:22.840" style="s2">argument at court is certainly supposed</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.160" end="01:06:25.240" style="s2">to hear that argument but at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.840" end="01:06:27.310" style="s2">it might be impossible to get a court to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.240" end="01:06:28.990" style="s2">give her a judgment that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.310" end="01:06:30.940" style="s2">hostile work environment and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.990" end="01:06:35.619" style="s2">found the rudiments of this as we were</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.940" end="01:06:36.970" style="s2">fixing to to sue the state for allowing</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.619" end="01:06:39.310" style="s2">Evergreen to be a hostile work</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.970" end="01:06:41.050" style="s2">environment and the problem was in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.310" end="01:06:43.390" style="s2">courts there was already this woke</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.050" end="01:06:46.660" style="s2">ideology that you know made them more</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.390" end="01:06:48.700" style="s2">interested in painting us as as racist</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.660" end="01:06:50.710" style="s2">than in engaging the fact that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.700" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">actually had people roving a campus with</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.710" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">baseball bats hunting professors I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:59.980" style="s2">come on yeah so it&#39;s a question mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.000" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">next question in the same vein why do</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.980" end="01:07:07.030" style="s2">human beings enjoy the sound of birdsong</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:08.590" style="s2">mmm I love this question yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.030" end="01:07:12.390" style="s2">think this one is it&#39;s let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.590" end="01:07:17.260" style="s2">way the first order answer is easy we</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.390" end="01:07:20.740" style="s2">look for proxies for productivity why do</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.260" end="01:07:23.830" style="s2">you find a particular valley beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.740" end="01:07:25.480" style="s2">and another one inhospitable that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.830" end="01:07:27.190" style="s2">gonna tend to correlate to how likely</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.480" end="01:07:29.290" style="s2">you are to be able to find things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.190" end="01:07:31.180" style="s2">your ancestors might have eaten there or</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.290" end="01:07:34.450" style="s2">to grow things that your ancestors might</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.180" end="01:07:35.950" style="s2">have grown there so you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.450" end="01:07:38.410" style="s2">we could have all kinds of creatures</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.950" end="01:07:40.750" style="s2">function it&#39;s like an omen that says yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.410" end="01:07:42.190" style="s2">this is the spot and the yes this is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.750" end="01:07:43.690" style="s2">spot creature it&#39;s just one that tends</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.190" end="01:07:44.859" style="s2">to be seen in places that are good and</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.690" end="01:07:49.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tend to be seen in places that</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.859" end="01:07:52.030" style="s2">are bad so this is probably wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.570" end="01:07:54.460" style="s2">one thing that occurs to me is that one</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.030" end="01:07:56.510" style="s2">of the leading hypotheses for why</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.460" end="01:08:00.260" style="s2">primates experienced an adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.510" end="01:08:02.030" style="s2">radiation when they did which is you</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.260" end="01:08:03.829" style="s2">know the earliest primates existed</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.030" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">before the KT boundary before Chicxulub</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.829" end="01:08:08.470" style="s2">hit what&#39;s now the Yucatan about 65</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">million years ago six million years ago</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.470" end="01:08:15.410" style="s2">but that we really expanded quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:17.420" style="s2">afterwards and that this was the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.410" end="01:08:20.150" style="s2">expansion was yes about the opening of</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.420" end="01:08:22.489" style="s2">niches as all the non-avian dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.150" end="01:08:24.170" style="s2">were now out of the way but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.489" end="01:08:26.179" style="s2">hypotheses also has to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.170" end="01:08:30.670" style="s2">coevolution of angiosperms of flowering</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.179" end="01:08:35.779" style="s2">plants and if because primates are</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.670" end="01:08:38.690" style="s2">largely like songbirds frugivores or</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.779" end="01:08:41.630" style="s2">many songbirds are pollinators as well</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.690" end="01:08:44.569" style="s2">but frugivores or insectivorous the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.630" end="01:08:47.540" style="s2">insects themselves being effective</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.569" end="01:08:51.710" style="s2">radiated so if all if all of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.540" end="01:08:52.730" style="s2">things promotes were in part Co evolving</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.710" end="01:08:54.980" style="s2">along with angiosperms or flowering</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.730" end="01:08:57.830" style="s2">plants I suspect although I know much</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.980" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">less about how we&#39;ve mapped songbird</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.830" end="01:09:01.130" style="s2">evolutions of songbirds is a is a real</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.140" style="s2">group it&#39;s passerines it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.130" end="01:09:04.520" style="s2">evolutionary group I suspect that they</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.140" end="01:09:06.469" style="s2">also experienced an adaptive radiation</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.520" end="01:09:08.060" style="s2">with angiosperms and flowering plants</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.469" end="01:09:09.890" style="s2">because how could they not they were</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.060" end="01:09:11.600" style="s2">mostly eating the same stuff so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.890" end="01:09:13.279" style="s2">possibly the primates and songbirds are</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.600" end="01:09:16.489" style="s2">both sort of mapped on to the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.279" end="01:09:19.850" style="s2">moment in plant evolution and that if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.489" end="01:09:22.509" style="s2">were all adaptively radiating at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.850" end="01:09:25.400" style="s2">same time we would have come to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.509" end="01:09:28.190" style="s2">basically have our aesthetic at a most</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.400" end="01:09:30.350" style="s2">fundamental level be that with whom we</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.190" end="01:09:31.910" style="s2">were evolving at the same time although</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.350" end="01:09:33.410" style="s2">not exactly Co evolving because we</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.910" end="01:09:35.029" style="s2">aren&#39;t dependent on songbirds for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.410" end="01:09:37.250" style="s2">most part they aren&#39;t big enough to for</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.029" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">us to be eating them and they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.250" end="01:09:40.429" style="s2">birds and mammals are eating different</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:43.549" style="s2">seeds of different toxins different</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.429" end="01:09:47.029" style="s2">preferences but it could have been a</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.549" end="01:09:50.540" style="s2">sort of emerging life at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.029" end="01:09:55.489" style="s2">and such as such a shared vision of</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.540" end="01:09:58.160" style="s2">beauty yep I mean there was a lot in</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.489" end="01:09:59.300" style="s2">that explanation I like it it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.160" end="01:10:01.480" style="s2">said it&#39;s probably wrong because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.300" end="01:10:04.580" style="s2">two hinges on too much at some level but</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.480" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">I&#39;m cautiously betting in favor of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.580" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">all right and I would say that the you</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.880" end="01:10:13.650" style="s2">we really at the end it&#39;s just basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.640" end="01:10:17.650" style="s2">then songbirds are a proxy for a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.650" end="01:10:19.390" style="s2">productive angiosperm ecosystem in which</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.650" end="01:10:21.640" style="s2">plants are paying to have their seeds</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.390" end="01:10:25.300" style="s2">distributed yeah that&#39;s likely to be a</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.640" end="01:10:27.160" style="s2">good place for people yeah yeah I love</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.300" end="01:10:29.560" style="s2">that question more questions like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.160" end="01:10:31.150" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good one what role has</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.560" end="01:10:32.920" style="s2">postmodernist thinking played in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.150" end="01:10:35.200" style="s2">recent protests and riots is the school</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.920" end="01:10:36.640" style="s2">of thought plus social media what drives</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.200" end="01:10:38.860" style="s2">behavior to engage with only the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.640" end="01:10:41.170" style="s2">periphery of info part of the root cause</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.860" end="01:10:45.010" style="s2">that went a little off the rails at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.170" end="01:10:46.810" style="s2">end but yeah yeah I mean this many of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.010" end="01:10:49.480" style="s2">our most recent live streams have been</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.810" end="01:10:51.700" style="s2">to this question and most of the people</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.480" end="01:10:54.550" style="s2">on the street wouldn&#39;t be able to name</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.700" end="01:10:55.900" style="s2">post modernist thinker probably some of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.550" end="01:10:57.370" style="s2">them could because they&#39;ve been schooled</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.900" end="01:11:00.990" style="s2">in it I schooled</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.370" end="01:11:04.000" style="s2">I used the word schooled intentionally</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.990" end="01:11:06.130" style="s2">but the fact that many people couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.000" end="01:11:09.250" style="s2">tell you about Foucault or Derrida or</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.130" end="01:11:12.070" style="s2">Marcus or whoever doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.250" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s not emerging from this these</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.070" end="01:11:19.420" style="s2">critical theories which is a direct</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:21.220" style="s2">outgrowth of post-modernism yeah I think</p>

<p begin="01:12:48.080" end="01:12:50.960" style="s2">Stonewall you especially since both</p>

<p begin="01:12:53.030" end="01:12:58.280" style="s2">question is one we haven&#39;t heard before</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.890" end="01:12:59.630" style="s2">so you have said we&#39;re not gonna go into</p>

<p begin="01:12:59.630" end="01:13:03.710" style="s2">see us coming wellzyn level let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.550" end="01:13:08.120" style="s2">this way we can talk about the Congress</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.710" end="01:13:11.360" style="s2">issue first of all there are a lot of in</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.120" end="01:13:14.330" style="s2">every place in the system you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.360" end="01:13:16.580" style="s2">people who are going to operate</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.330" end="01:13:19.310" style="s2">according to the corrupt modality of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.580" end="01:13:20.930" style="s2">system because frankly it&#39;s the smart</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.310" end="01:13:23.210" style="s2">thing to do right you can starve</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.930" end="01:13:24.860" style="s2">yourself by not participating you can be</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.210" end="01:13:27.770" style="s2">a jerk and you can be corrupt no matter</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.860" end="01:13:29.330" style="s2">what or you can function according to</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.770" end="01:13:31.550" style="s2">the rules of the system as you find them</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.330" end="01:13:33.890" style="s2">and hope for better rules and so some</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.550" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">fraction of the Congress is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.890" end="01:13:38.870" style="s2">people who would love to be freed but</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing for unity 2020 to work</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.870" end="01:13:44.360" style="s2">we need a groundswell sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:47.450" style="s2">draft these candidates that groundswell</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.360" end="01:13:49.400" style="s2">is a credible threat against people who</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.450" end="01:13:51.890" style="s2">Stonewall in the Congress in other words</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.400" end="01:13:54.620" style="s2">the reason that this can succeed is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.890" end="01:13:56.780" style="s2">people are livid at how they are being</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.620" end="01:13:59.150" style="s2">treated by their government to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.780" end="01:14:02.140" style="s2">extent that you have people in Congress</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.150" end="01:14:05.480" style="s2">who find themselves faced with a</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.140" end="01:14:08.180" style="s2">presidential team that has been elected</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.480" end="01:14:10.070" style="s2">specifically to drain the swamp there is</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.180" end="01:14:13.160" style="s2">an incentive to declare yourself not of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.070" end="01:14:15.260" style="s2">the swamp to take a pledge perhaps that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.160" end="01:14:18.530" style="s2">would prevent you from participating in</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.260" end="01:14:19.970" style="s2">swamp like behavior and I believe there</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.530" end="01:14:24.290" style="s2">are many ways that this could function</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.970" end="01:14:26.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a small issue but</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.290" end="01:14:29.020" style="s2">let&#39;s just say the groundswell that</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.390" end="01:14:31.280" style="s2">tells the apparatus that we are</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.020" end="01:14:33.560" style="s2">completely sick of being treated this</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.280" end="01:14:34.580" style="s2">way and being parasitized is the key not</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.560" end="01:14:37.490" style="s2">only to changing</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.580" end="01:14:40.220" style="s2">the people in the White House but to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.490" end="01:14:44.350" style="s2">change into Congress okay we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.220" end="01:14:46.310" style="s2">make quickly go through these six okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.350" end="01:14:49.790" style="s2">knowing that we&#39;re going well beyond our</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.310" end="01:14:51.710" style="s2">our John mentioned a change in black</p>

<p begin="01:14:51.710" end="01:14:55.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this is my probably</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.340" end="01:15:01.010" style="s2">believe so but ain&#39;t here more okay so</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.430" end="01:15:04.010" style="s2">John this is a reference to the black</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.010" end="01:15:05.900" style="s2">intellectuals roundtable which you</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.010" end="01:15:08.420" style="s2">moderated that was posted on this</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.900" end="01:15:10.310" style="s2">channel yesterday John mentioned and had</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.420" end="01:15:12.770" style="s2">two of the men named John John McWhorter</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.310" end="01:15:14.030" style="s2">and John Wood jr. John mentioned a</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.770" end="01:15:16.250" style="s2">change in black communities between</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.030" end="01:15:18.980" style="s2">nineteen sixty and eighty could this be</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.250" end="01:15:21.110" style="s2">linked to the change in black music from</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.980" end="01:15:23.330" style="s2">the love and peace values of Motown to</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.110" end="01:15:27.590" style="s2">violence money and objectifying women in</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.330" end="01:15:29.720" style="s2">rap especially for young black men yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.590" end="01:15:33.110" style="s2">and no that is very interesting my guess</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.720" end="01:15:40.880" style="s2">is the music is a symptom and that in</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.110" end="01:15:43.730" style="s2">effect what you have is a a pattern in</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:46.910" style="s2">which it is clear that the hope for</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.730" end="01:15:49.400" style="s2">trajectory has been abandoned right that</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.910" end="01:15:52.040" style="s2">something is now in the way right so you</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.400" end="01:15:53.540" style="s2">had the hopeful progress of the civil</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.040" end="01:15:55.490" style="s2">rights movement and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.540" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">something get derailed and I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.490" end="01:16:02.440" style="s2">point is people who find that a system</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:06.380" style="s2">is no longer responsive to their needs</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.440" end="01:16:09.050" style="s2">become cynical about it and rebellious</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.380" end="01:16:11.090" style="s2">against it and they generate their own</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.050" end="01:16:12.800" style="s2">culture that no longer participates so</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.090" end="01:16:14.050" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t want to claim to know</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.800" end="01:16:16.550" style="s2">more about it than I do</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.050" end="01:16:19.790" style="s2">but I do think you have to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.550" end="01:16:21.620" style="s2">the question just the shift in music</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.790" end="01:16:23.390" style="s2">over the same period of time doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.620" end="01:16:25.490" style="s2">tell you whether that is a symptom of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.390" end="01:16:27.560" style="s2">the same phenomenon or whether it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.490" end="01:16:29.780" style="s2">causal and my guess is it isn&#39;t causal</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.560" end="01:16:31.670" style="s2">that the nature of music in human beings</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.780" end="01:16:33.739" style="s2">is that it&#39;s going to track our mindsets</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.670" end="01:16:38.309" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.739" end="01:16:39.389" style="s2">drive them just to get back to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.309" end="01:16:42.059" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.389" end="01:16:45.320" style="s2">they do say linked so that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.059" end="01:16:48.659" style="s2">although I also I read it as you did as</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.320" end="01:16:50.789" style="s2">could it be causal the idea of linkage I</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.659" end="01:16:52.650" style="s2">think is actually almost certain now</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.789" end="01:16:56.099" style="s2">that you say it I mean it does it does</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.650" end="01:16:58.380" style="s2">match the greater cultural change and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.099" end="01:17:02.969" style="s2">you know probably there&#39;s interplay back</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.380" end="01:17:05.489" style="s2">and forth but more likely the music is</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.969" end="01:17:08.570" style="s2">affect there is another factor though</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.489" end="01:17:12.889" style="s2">that we have to cover which is that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.570" end="01:17:15.780" style="s2">Motown era was accompanied by some</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.889" end="01:17:19.199" style="s2">predatory business practices against</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.780" end="01:17:20.909" style="s2">black artists in the extreme so lots of</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.199" end="01:17:22.559" style="s2">black artists who produced really</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.909" end="01:17:25.949" style="s2">important music and had a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.559" end="01:17:29.309" style="s2">influence were just shut out of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.949" end="01:17:33.599" style="s2">benefits of what they had created and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.309" end="01:17:35.849" style="s2">and the music itself was also altered by</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.599" end="01:17:37.739" style="s2">the fact that in some sense part of what</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.849" end="01:17:39.030" style="s2">it did was appeal to black audiences but</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.739" end="01:17:41.940" style="s2">part of what it did was appeal to white</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.030" end="01:17:44.059" style="s2">audiences too and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.940" end="01:17:48.179" style="s2">stuff that might not have been</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.059" end="01:17:50.400" style="s2">organically produced in the black</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.179" end="01:17:53.030" style="s2">community that was nonetheless saleable</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.400" end="01:17:56.820" style="s2">and so there&#39;s kind of a presentation of</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.030" end="01:17:58.949" style="s2">black culture that was more palatable to</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.820" end="01:18:01.380" style="s2">white culture and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.949" end="01:18:03.059" style="s2">black artists rightly got more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.380" end="01:18:05.309" style="s2">got more credit got more of the money</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.059" end="01:18:08.039" style="s2">from the music they produced they also</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.309" end="01:18:10.829" style="s2">became independent of that structure and</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.039" end="01:18:13.289" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know how all those things fit</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.829" end="01:18:15.659" style="s2">together but my guess is that what we</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.289" end="01:18:19.110" style="s2">are seeing partly is constraint in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.659" end="01:18:22.980" style="s2">Motown era and that the removal of some</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.110" end="01:18:25.800" style="s2">of that constraint resulted in a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.980" end="01:18:28.380" style="s2">different presentation okay five more</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.800" end="01:18:29.880" style="s2">dear Heather and Bret I would love to</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.980" end="01:18:59.130" style="s2">our extensive libraries when we left</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.830" end="01:19:01.440" style="s2">Evergreen I think I just I loved being</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.130" end="01:19:03.270" style="s2">able to have the books that we have and</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.440" end="01:19:06.090" style="s2">wish we had even more space for more of</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.270" end="01:19:09.390" style="s2">them not I thought you necessarily often</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.090" end="01:19:13.500" style="s2">experience but but yeah I do I do have</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.390" end="01:19:14.970" style="s2">some up some such lists up next question</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.500" end="01:19:16.830" style="s2">what are your thoughts on the letter</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.970" end="01:19:19.320" style="s2">unjustice and open debate published July</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.830" end="01:19:21.900" style="s2">7th and Harper&#39;s have either of you</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.320" end="01:19:24.660" style="s2">thought about signing it we were not</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.900" end="01:19:26.670" style="s2">asked to sign it I would not have signed</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.660" end="01:19:28.410" style="s2">it would you have signed it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.670" end="01:19:31.170" style="s2">think so but it&#39;s hard to know yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.410" end="01:19:32.940" style="s2">easy to say probably not but I think we</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.170" end="01:19:36.120" style="s2">should cover this I I thought we might</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.940" end="01:19:40.490" style="s2">get to it today and we didn&#39;t but I must</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.120" end="01:19:46.100" style="s2">say I am very troubled by that letter</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.490" end="01:19:50.490" style="s2">not so much for what it does say but how</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.100" end="01:19:53.780" style="s2">it divides people who naturally are not</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.490" end="01:19:56.010" style="s2">to be divided must not be divided and</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.780" end="01:19:58.500" style="s2">anyway so I found the letter very</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.010" end="01:20:00.030" style="s2">troubling that said we have a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.500" end="01:20:03.660" style="s2">number of friends on that list who</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.030" end="01:20:05.760" style="s2">signed that letter and so they in some</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.660" end="01:20:08.190" style="s2">sense have been dragged into something I</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.760" end="01:20:09.480" style="s2">think my guess is they would have the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.190" end="01:20:13.110" style="s2">same complaints about it that we would</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.480" end="01:20:22.110" style="s2">so let&#39;s cover it more in detail next</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.110" end="01:20:24.180" style="s2">time oh this is this is from someone who</p>

<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:43.650" style="s2">very frequently alarmed by the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.889" end="01:21:44.969" style="s2">perspective that he arrives at so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.650" end="01:21:47.790" style="s2">not that I wouldn&#39;t consider talking to</p>
