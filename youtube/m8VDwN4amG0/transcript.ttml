<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:03.990" style="s2">be great but tell me tell me a bit I</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.770" end="00:00:05.730" style="s2">mean you know we can meander through</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.990" end="00:00:08.639" style="s2">everything I think that there will be in</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.730" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">an air of familiarity between us</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">yes just coming from the thought of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">Heidegger and I I&#39;m I did a PhD on</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">Heidegger that&#39;s so that&#39;s in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">I&#39;m a scholar but I don&#39;t have a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.350" end="00:00:28.769" style="s2">scholarly approach to Heidegger yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.689" style="s2">that&#39;s all I think and not to philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.769" end="00:00:32.279" style="s2">I think this is also why academic</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.689" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">philosophy I mean to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.279" end="00:00:37.829" style="s2">it&#39;s a necessary evil because you need</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">to go to a place and study really for</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.829" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">years and some people actually achieve</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">doing that outside of university I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">probably I&#39;m not sure if I could or</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">could have done without an extended</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">period of just focusing on on one topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">but but then it just it circles around</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">itself right it&#39;s just it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:08.549" style="s2">machine that needs functioning it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it it is just you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.549" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">term would be sure on that Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">uses it it&#39;s just like standing reserved</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">yeah oh yeah what what all affected II</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">mean really turns into it is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">producing more for the sake of producing</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:28.380" style="s2">more for it to be ready for use for why</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:31.619" style="s2">because well because just because right</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.380" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">this is keep struggling around it and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.619" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">you know and I think in high to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">especially in hiding it he&#39;s like wanna</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">and stopped me if I talk too much right</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">but I think what do you get with hiding</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:46.920" style="s2">is that he&#39;s born in the 19th century or</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">in a in a small town in southern Germany</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.920" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">and then these machines really moving in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">to where he lives and sisa obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">the destruction right and Brussels or in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:00.799" style="s2">the Second World War so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">why you have to take him quite you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">seriously he&#39;s not just he&#39;s he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:10.950" style="s2">of almost like a memory of the old world</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:12.629" style="s2">and then gets thrown into the the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.950" end="00:02:14.090" style="s2">century in all of its horrors and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.629" end="00:02:18.500" style="s2">certainly not innocent</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.090" end="00:02:21.080" style="s2">Marisha yeah yes kind of have I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.500" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">have a a similar feel because I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.080" end="00:02:25.819" style="s2">think I&#39;m one of the last generations</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:28.940" style="s2">one of them I think that has it as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.819" end="00:02:31.940" style="s2">memory before the internet yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.940" end="00:02:32.390" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a memory is a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.940" end="00:02:35.180" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.390" end="00:02:38.090" style="s2">yeah memories are very important I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.180" end="00:02:40.010" style="s2">that memory or name alternate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.090" end="00:02:44.030" style="s2">Mazzini I think you&#39;d say in proper</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.010" end="00:02:47.180" style="s2">English the Greek word for memory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.030" end="00:02:50.780" style="s2">in a strange way dying as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.180" end="00:02:52.670" style="s2">outsourcing it all to the Internet but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.780" end="00:02:54.500" style="s2">you you have a memory without the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:56.269" style="s2">internet you could even extend that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.500" end="00:03:00.549" style="s2">saying what does it mean to have memory</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.269" end="00:03:04.670" style="s2">without having an actual lived memory</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.549" end="00:03:06.200" style="s2">that&#39;s then passed down but you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.670" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">because now if you don&#39;t know what how</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.200" end="00:03:11.750" style="s2">to do something you just go online you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:18.980" style="s2">type into youtube how to watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.750" end="00:03:25.310" style="s2">machine stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s useful it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.980" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">actually but it&#39;s kind of there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.310" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">strange thing in that I&#39;ve read up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:31.099" style="s2">on what your what do you as you put it</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.480" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve discovered it would you call</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.099" end="00:03:36.410" style="s2">circling an interesting way of putting</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">it is to say if this counted rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.410" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">saying I&#39;ve invented it yeah come up</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:48.769" style="s2">with a very different approach already</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:50.569" style="s2">yes - to - to what do you do yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.769" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a and I think time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.569" end="00:03:54.620" style="s2">temporalities is important and what in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:57.019" style="s2">what do you do right and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.620" end="00:03:58.609" style="s2">trying to get across and what would the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.019" end="00:04:02.060" style="s2">internet does to a certain degree is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.609" end="00:04:05.349" style="s2">eradicate time but in a very strange way</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.060" end="00:04:08.989" style="s2">it because time is still there the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.349" end="00:04:11.419" style="s2">the the time of the internet is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.989" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">unix and it started somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.419" end="00:04:17.349" style="s2">nineteen sometime in the 1970s and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:20.750" style="s2">reason we can use this tool right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.349" end="00:04:27.060" style="s2">you know line nine thirty here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.750" end="00:04:28.410" style="s2">what one thirty Berkeley is because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.060" end="00:04:32.460" style="s2">the Internet is actually completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.410" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">homogeneous yeah yeah it&#39;s and that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.460" end="00:04:39.330" style="s2">far as my understanding of that goes it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">is it&#39;s too abstract for me but it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.330" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">the manipulation that takes place online</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:47.210" style="s2">or on screen is actually - certainly we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:50.669" style="s2">also related to time but it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.210" end="00:04:52.050" style="s2">human time or earthly time or anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.669" end="00:04:55.860" style="s2">like it so there is something eerie</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.050" end="00:04:59.970" style="s2">about yeah like hot like honking like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.860" end="00:05:03.480" style="s2">that sense of but but haunting in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.970" end="00:05:07.140" style="s2">way that where I just notice where I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.480" end="00:05:12.120" style="s2">still be scared of it yeah a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.140" end="00:05:15.300" style="s2">people that are younger than me who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.120" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">quite strange characters right like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.300" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">really like literally like classic</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:24.300" style="s2">autism good I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:27.380" style="s2">optimistic or not but what I think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.300" end="00:05:30.360" style="s2">it yeah yeah where they when they speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.380" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">they&#39;re all they&#39;re all they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.360" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">values are very articulated and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:39.000" style="s2">irrational and altruistic and explicit</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:40.919" style="s2">and then they they speak literally in</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:44.490" style="s2">like a screen opens up and they get</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.919" end="00:05:49.020" style="s2">lines of information and analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.490" end="00:05:50.220" style="s2">they&#39;re really bright but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.020" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">interesting is they have done they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.220" end="00:05:58.229" style="s2">have they don&#39;t have any temporal</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:06:00.660" style="s2">coordination in the relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.229" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing I think you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.660" end="00:06:05.880" style="s2">the things I think I&#39;m understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:08.789" style="s2">where part of my understanding or how I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">am able to see like encircling or have</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.789" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">the particular way is house actually has</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">to do with Heidegger right yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:19.640" style="s2">understanding like because to read</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:22.200" style="s2">Heidegger it&#39;s interesting for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.640" end="00:06:25.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a real different kind of reading in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.200" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">my experience because it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.470" end="00:06:32.430" style="s2">about I know this like it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:36.030" style="s2">about understanding what he&#39;s saying but</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.430" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">it&#39;s more oxime to be a what it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.030" end="00:06:40.830" style="s2">attempt to understand him</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:46.770" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.830" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">I think for me that yoga stretch or that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.770" end="00:06:53.729" style="s2">stepping so up outside or actually not</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">outside but so into the background right</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.729" end="00:06:59.669" style="s2">to then look and to try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">that motion over and over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.669" end="00:07:03.659" style="s2">over again all of a sudden I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:06.539" style="s2">started to like see backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.659" end="00:07:09.150" style="s2">foregrounds and were temporalities and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.539" end="00:07:11.610" style="s2">like and then language would just come</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.150" end="00:07:13.979" style="s2">out of that right yeah yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.610" end="00:07:15.569" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s being in time that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.979" end="00:07:19.169" style="s2">experience of reading being in time or</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.569" end="00:07:21.090" style="s2">is it yeah and I being in time in an end</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:23.610" style="s2">and his other work too and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.090" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">people I&#39;ve read a lot of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.610" end="00:07:29.550" style="s2">written about his work as well hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:33.900" style="s2">now I&#39;m like diving into the young</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.550" end="00:07:35.909" style="s2">Heidegger which who&#39;s that but all day</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.900" end="00:08:04.289" style="s2">young Heidegger it&#39;s um office right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.909" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">here but I but it&#39;s well I just think</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.289" end="00:08:08.690" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating how deeply he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:14.190" style="s2">looking at is in his younger years like</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.819" end="00:08:16.740" style="s2">this is the lately I&#39;ve gotten kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.190" end="00:08:22.279" style="s2">infected by his younger when he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.740" end="00:08:28.590" style="s2">younger yeah how deeply he was in to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.279" end="00:08:33.140" style="s2">like the Christian mystics you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.590" end="00:08:36.510" style="s2">Ekans and and a lot of these like deeply</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.140" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">theological thinkers and how he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.510" end="00:08:43.169" style="s2">took a lot of them and ontology it in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.810" end="00:08:45.029" style="s2">certain sense and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.169" end="00:08:47.579" style="s2">because it was in its in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.029" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">understanding that more right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.579" end="00:08:52.829" style="s2">mean instead I just bought a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">his ol is his actual earlier works I</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.829" end="00:08:58.470" style="s2">haven&#39;t told them to him yet</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:09:00.370" style="s2">but that&#39;s reading that it&#39;s funny I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.470" end="00:09:03.070" style="s2">understanding I think a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.370" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">especially around temporality and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.070" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">primordial it is yeah yeah that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:14.530" style="s2">that sense of the future kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:18.010" style="s2">could say kind of the future going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.530" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">the past and into the present right like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.010" end="00:09:25.810" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t go future present past it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:28.630" style="s2">like it&#39;s the sense of yeah it&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:31.740" style="s2">is why hee hee hee in in in the Chairman</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.630" end="00:09:36.400" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t speak of a garden hide on</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.740" end="00:09:38.200" style="s2">his ends and too closed he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.400" end="00:09:41.410" style="s2">garden had would be in English past he</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.200" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">speaks of it as having been given height</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.410" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">and I think the English grammatical form</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:50.830" style="s2">he brings it out quite well but what has</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:53.230" style="s2">been still lingers on yeah like I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.830" end="00:09:55.180" style="s2">been doing this forever have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.230" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">this I&#39;ve been reading Heidegger for so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.180" end="00:09:59.110" style="s2">many years now that means there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">something that lingers from the past and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.110" end="00:10:03.250" style="s2">it isn&#39;t and and then the there is there</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:07.030" style="s2">is a sense of presence in high ticket</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.250" end="00:10:11.880" style="s2">but it is not not this presence of say</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.030" end="00:10:14.200" style="s2">often of the perfect consumption</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.880" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">consumer society we live in where we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.200" end="00:10:17.800" style="s2">and they always trapped in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:19.390" style="s2">presence but that presence is you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.800" end="00:10:21.700" style="s2">presence with immediacy in that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.390" end="00:10:24.090" style="s2">just react to certain things but that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.700" end="00:10:28.810" style="s2">good presence comes about as he</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.090" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">ecstatically so it&#39;s a standing out into</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.810" end="00:10:34.960" style="s2">at the same time of standing back into</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:38.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s so and the future true</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.960" end="00:10:41.020" style="s2">cold in German you can you know he reads</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.230" end="00:10:44.680" style="s2">this as saying it&#39;s coming towards ya</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.020" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">so there&#39;s design is in a dozen in terms</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.680" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">just means presence and existence and be</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:51.730" style="s2">there being right being there design and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">design is not some kind of a homunculus</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.730" end="00:10:55.990" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s not properly you or I or</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">any kind of an abstract way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.990" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">describing the human being design just</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">means that the way we are and so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:08.080" style="s2">that&#39;s why me means by by being right</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:11.019" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s always it&#39;s this activity that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.080" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">then we are right like what seems they</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.019" end="00:11:14.649" style="s2">really say something way way and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:18.160" style="s2">always I mean this is why the hands come</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.649" end="00:11:20.680" style="s2">in because words themselves don&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.160" end="00:11:25.110" style="s2">express it but that which comes towards</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:28.089" style="s2">us from that which has been right</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.110" end="00:11:29.860" style="s2">properly then if doesn&#39;t but death is</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.089" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">very important is we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.860" end="00:11:34.899" style="s2">at some point but surely in purely</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.410" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">structural terms that which has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.899" end="00:11:43.450" style="s2">it&#39;s coming towards us from that which</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:46.089" style="s2">will be and that forms the presence but</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.450" end="00:11:48.579" style="s2">at the same time that which is to come</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.089" end="00:11:51.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t just you know coming from behind</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.579" end="00:11:53.709" style="s2">as it were just from what has been there</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.310" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">are always also so you could say bubbles</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.709" end="00:12:01.779" style="s2">and being a new hujrat new horizons yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:06.490" style="s2">being torn open and and heard I mean for</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.779" end="00:12:11.260" style="s2">example one of hiding his most beloved</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.490" end="00:12:12.910" style="s2">poets speaks also of time tearing open</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.260" end="00:12:16.420" style="s2">new horizons so in that sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.910" end="00:12:19.270" style="s2">as you put it time is primordial yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.420" end="00:12:21.459" style="s2">miss oddly primordial but the way we</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.270" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">been before Heidegger it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.459" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">in the in being in time I think you put</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">it well when you said you know I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:34.120" style="s2">paraphrase you that it isn&#39;t Theory it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.910" end="00:12:35.290" style="s2">is he&#39;s not trying to have any test in</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.120" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">several times that I&#39;m not producing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.290" end="00:12:40.060" style="s2">anything he&#39;s actually just ask when</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:41.890" style="s2">there are these hints that he gives</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.060" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">there&#39;s always footnotes and all of his</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.890" end="00:12:47.100" style="s2">text for example in being in times very</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:50.279" style="s2">interesting footnote when he says that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.100" end="00:12:54.760" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s what it what&#39;s it what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.279" end="00:12:56.199" style="s2">translated as I think the oratory off</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.760" end="00:12:59.260" style="s2">you know which is usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.199" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">considered to be a book about speaking</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.260" end="00:13:03.970" style="s2">about how to give a speech how to give a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:05.589" style="s2">talk so it&#39;s a theory about how you give</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.970" end="00:13:10.149" style="s2">a talk in hiding he says that&#39;s nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.589" end="00:13:13.649" style="s2">it is actually an hermeneutical analytic</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.149" end="00:13:18.070" style="s2">or diagnosis of the air of everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.649" end="00:13:20.350" style="s2">so he reads all of philosophy about how</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.070" end="00:13:21.370" style="s2">do we mean he doesn&#39;t use the word but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:24.430" style="s2">how do we live how</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.370" end="00:13:27.880" style="s2">we exist and then it becomes encrusted</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.430" end="00:13:30.100" style="s2">over time and taken to be timeless the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.880" end="00:13:35.320" style="s2">truth truthful propositions of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.100" end="00:13:37.930" style="s2">tested against the logical necessity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.320" end="00:13:39.430" style="s2">coherence etc when he&#39;s trying to break</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.930" end="00:13:40.660" style="s2">free from all of that and saying look</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.430" end="00:13:42.790" style="s2">what but they were trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.660" end="00:13:45.930" style="s2">something else entirely he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.790" end="00:13:48.460" style="s2">back to that from within a master</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.930" end="00:13:50.470" style="s2">Western framework which of course always</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.460" end="00:13:53.339" style="s2">already falls back into that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.470" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">philosophy being institutionalized and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.339" end="00:13:57.610" style="s2">scholarly etc especially with the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:00.010" style="s2">century that&#39;s coming up but so</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.610" end="00:14:01.690" style="s2">structurally you have all of this and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.010" end="00:14:04.960" style="s2">a certain degree you know you can also</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.690" end="00:14:09.160" style="s2">read then design in that sense not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.960" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">you yourself in your own memories and an</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.160" end="00:14:16.779" style="s2">origin and birth and thoroughness but</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.230" end="00:14:20.589" style="s2">history in its entirety yeah it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.779" end="00:14:25.089" style="s2">already sweeping back slowly like in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.589" end="00:14:26.950" style="s2">coming back in waves and crashing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.089" end="00:14:29.890" style="s2">because before Heidegger he said we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.950" end="00:14:32.170" style="s2">the locust of history but that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.890" end="00:14:34.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that we are like so a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.170" end="00:14:37.630" style="s2">humanist to speak very properly a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.660" end="00:14:38.680" style="s2">humanistic or humanist understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.630" end="00:14:40.810" style="s2">history would mean that we are the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.680" end="00:14:42.850" style="s2">ancients of history right we make</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.810" end="00:14:45.100" style="s2">everything like we can hack the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.850" end="00:14:46.150" style="s2">and then just put a new app in it bla</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.100" end="00:14:48.220" style="s2">bla bla</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.150" end="00:14:51.310" style="s2">no that&#39;s not what he means it means</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.220" end="00:14:55.660" style="s2">that we are you know extremely fragile</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.310" end="00:14:58.060" style="s2">and qua finite beings we are the place</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.660" end="00:15:03.970" style="s2">of history because it breaks out within</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.060" end="00:15:06.550" style="s2">our temporalities in memory and but but</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.970" end="00:15:08.830" style="s2">for being in time what what the book is</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.550" end="00:15:10.660" style="s2">I think trying to say is that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.830" end="00:15:14.680" style="s2">have one without the other and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:16.510" style="s2">means you cannot have the authentic way</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.680" end="00:15:18.520" style="s2">of being which is in this state it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.510" end="00:15:21.130" style="s2">way of being again without the unit</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.520" end="00:15:25.510" style="s2">entik one is never without the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.130" end="00:15:29.260" style="s2">just like disclosure or um concealment</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.510" end="00:15:34.579" style="s2">or openness more nearness cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.260" end="00:15:36.949" style="s2">without absconded absalom needle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.579" end="00:15:39.889" style="s2">Andy that&#39;s a good one isn&#39;t it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.949" end="00:15:41.329" style="s2">yeah yeah being absconds I think for</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.889" end="00:15:45.980" style="s2">high together that&#39;s what it does and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.329" end="00:15:47.239" style="s2">then it comes back so oh and that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.980" end="00:15:49.819" style="s2">cannot have one without the other you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.239" end="00:15:51.439" style="s2">cannot have total concealment sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.819" end="00:15:54.589" style="s2">can&#39;t have total unconsumed</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.439" end="00:15:56.660" style="s2">you can have total disclosure because</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.589" end="00:15:58.970" style="s2">every every disclosure every moment of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.660" end="00:16:01.629" style="s2">disclosure is structured fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.970" end="00:16:04.790" style="s2">by concealment hiding actually in it my</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.629" end="00:16:06.529" style="s2">hope hope hope I hope I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.790" end="00:16:10.689" style="s2">paraphrasing him too much for that in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.529" end="00:16:13.879" style="s2">letter to father Richardson he says time</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.689" end="00:16:16.999" style="s2">if being is you know being that means</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.879" end="00:16:20.709" style="s2">presence unreason that that which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.999" end="00:16:26.360" style="s2">there and open but time is that which</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.709" end="00:16:28.519" style="s2">okay the time is that which by time is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.360" end="00:16:30.589" style="s2">that which self conceals and structures</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.519" end="00:16:33.319" style="s2">that very presence yeah this is why the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.589" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">title being and time is not an additive</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.319" end="00:16:38.389" style="s2">is not being here in time here it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:40.160" style="s2">almost like one word right being time</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.389" end="00:16:43.249" style="s2">it&#39;s one word it but it but it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:48.589" style="s2">have the end because the end is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.249" end="00:16:50.689" style="s2">you know 1+1 yes but it&#39;s it&#39;s you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.589" end="00:16:53.269" style="s2">you cannot think what he means by being</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.689" end="00:16:55.939" style="s2">without what he calls time how he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.269" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">time works and the way I think within</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.939" end="00:17:01.970" style="s2">being in time you you enter you can and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:03.679" style="s2">send this sounded like this was your</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.970" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">experience over the years of reading</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.679" end="00:17:08.149" style="s2">this so then opens something up right</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:10.639" style="s2">there it isn&#39;t about okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.149" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">memorize this right then I&#39;m gonna argue</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.639" end="00:17:14.839" style="s2">oh this is actually wrong um because</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:17.929" style="s2">it&#39;s developmental and it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.839" end="00:17:21.110" style="s2">something open yes like it frees</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.929" end="00:17:23.480" style="s2">something yes and I think in historical</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.110" end="00:17:26.990" style="s2">terms of hiding it either consciously or</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.480" end="00:17:28.610" style="s2">not I wouldn&#39;t care he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.990" end="00:17:30.769" style="s2">freeing us from the matrix of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.610" end="00:17:33.019" style="s2">cartesianism we&#39;re retracting our brains</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.769" end="00:17:35.899" style="s2">and within our own minds you know yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.019" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">hacked the brain and then I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.899" end="00:17:40.549" style="s2">literally where the idea of I think off</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:42.470" style="s2">the cloud which is a neo Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.549" end="00:17:44.179" style="s2">right I just all I have to do is get rid</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.470" end="00:17:45.980" style="s2">of the prison of the flash and then I</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.179" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">can think about myself and live forever</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.980" end="00:17:49.910" style="s2">freely in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:53.710" style="s2">out which is Google&#39;s plan ultimately so</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.910" end="00:17:56.780" style="s2">that there has to took Gnosticism into</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.710" end="00:18:00.590" style="s2">Descartes and so hiding is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.780" end="00:18:02.450" style="s2">free us from that subject object economy</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.590" end="00:18:04.460" style="s2">where the world is just an object to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.450" end="00:18:06.050" style="s2">right an object of use of manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.460" end="00:18:08.440" style="s2">something that&#39;s present at hand as he</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.050" end="00:18:10.790" style="s2">calls it for hunting but I can relate</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.440" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">which is modern subjectivity or</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.790" end="00:18:14.930" style="s2">subjectivism in a nutshell yes he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:17.990" style="s2">trying to say no what you are is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.930" end="00:18:20.210" style="s2">finite being thrown into the world there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.990" end="00:18:22.910" style="s2">is no distinction between you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.210" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">eye and the foul in that sense yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.910" end="00:18:28.190" style="s2">and and I think what ultimately the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">book is doing because hiding is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.190" end="00:18:33.380" style="s2">approaching is the transformation of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:37.040" style="s2">human being if I&#39;m and alone was</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.380" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">mentioned is to be pushed you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.040" end="00:18:43.000" style="s2">you&#39;re pushed towards death yeah being</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">in time what you&#39;re ultimately always</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.000" end="00:18:48.770" style="s2">facing is your own death and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:52.970" style="s2">he calls it as a very strange way of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.770" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">putting it your own most possibility it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.970" end="00:18:58.310" style="s2">gives you nothing to actualize and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:18:59.870" style="s2">that&#39;s painful for the modern subject</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.310" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">because the modern subject the modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.870" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">human being must actually wear you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.690" end="00:19:07.240" style="s2">look at look at like any kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.690" end="00:19:14.990" style="s2">any advertisement as pretty to say any</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.410" end="00:19:18.200" style="s2">advertisement right will be for fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.990" end="00:19:19.730" style="s2">your potential or we are unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.200" end="00:19:21.170" style="s2">potential that&#39;s all metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.730" end="00:19:23.060" style="s2">language for Heidegger yes to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.170" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2">degree we are potential and we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.060" end="00:19:30.380" style="s2">possibility move this fight but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:33.110" style="s2">also ultimately bound up and limited by</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.380" end="00:19:36.170" style="s2">a possibility that that is our most</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.110" end="00:19:38.900" style="s2">authentic possibility that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.170" end="00:19:42.890" style="s2">nothing to actualize and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.900" end="00:19:45.680" style="s2">tension that is all it is nearly</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.890" end="00:19:48.830" style="s2">unbearable for the mother subject but he</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.680" end="00:19:51.230" style="s2">says this is what we have to push the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.830" end="00:19:53.540" style="s2">human being towards in modernity because</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.230" end="00:19:55.880" style="s2">this is what&#39;s lacking and this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.540" end="00:19:57.530" style="s2">think you know not only not that this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.880" end="00:19:59.780" style="s2">why but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.530" end="00:20:02.120" style="s2">you could look at in more detail at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.780" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">structural reasons for example why is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.120" end="00:20:09.530" style="s2">that Silicon Valley is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">eradicate death great because it gives</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.530" end="00:20:14.300" style="s2">them nothing to actualize because death</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:16.940" style="s2">is the last realm that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.300" end="00:20:18.440" style="s2">measured it&#39;s a round thing once you</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.940" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">think of death has a realm and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.440" end="00:20:24.980" style="s2">saying a lot now I know once you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:29.420" style="s2">of it as a realm as I mention it always</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.980" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">already into a certain degree but but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.420" end="00:20:36.260" style="s2">gives us nothing to this just nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:38.180" style="s2">right and that nothingness though is of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.260" end="00:20:41.020" style="s2">course as Heidegger puts it very active</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.180" end="00:20:45.040" style="s2">but the nothing neither lace yes totally</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.020" end="00:20:49.460" style="s2">and nothing to actualize isn&#39;t like an</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.040" end="00:20:52.250" style="s2">necessarily like an absence like but</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.460" end="00:20:55.060" style="s2">it&#39;s an actual quote it&#39;s a terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.250" end="00:20:58.940" style="s2">quality or it&#39;s the way things presents</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.060" end="00:21:01.550" style="s2">like so like to act to actualize nothing</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.940" end="00:21:05.030" style="s2">is is actually not just negative right</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.550" end="00:21:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah what in I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.030" end="00:21:11.720" style="s2">question is in actual izing nothing what</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:14.830" style="s2">is what is it that gets actualized when</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.720" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">I actualize the nothing is there but</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.830" end="00:21:19.670" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:21.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t actualize the nothing because</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.670" end="00:21:24.050" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing it&#39;s like there there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.680" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">this utter limit yeah been pushed</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.050" end="00:21:28.730" style="s2">against oh yeah right there like I could</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:30.260" style="s2">just feel in myself</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.730" end="00:21:34.790" style="s2">I don&#39;t want there to be a limit you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.260" end="00:21:37.850" style="s2">know think of modern subjectivity as</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.790" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">always right so I&#39;m gonna make this you</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.850" end="00:21:42.500" style="s2">mean no offense but you&#39;re an American</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:44.990" style="s2">Americans are all about making the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.500" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">impossible possible yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.990" end="00:21:51.110" style="s2">making America great again going to the</p>

<p begin="00:21:56.750" end="00:22:00.110" style="s2">like we you know the frontiers there it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.460" end="00:22:02.900" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.110" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s very manic to be honest it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.900" end="00:22:07.309" style="s2">there&#39;s something admirable about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:12.179" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.309" end="00:22:15.179" style="s2">there is this limit that there is death</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.179" end="00:22:18.360" style="s2">that that always already is as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.179" end="00:22:20.130" style="s2">we are four Heidegger the end and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.360" end="00:22:23.850" style="s2">there is nothing there you can access by</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.130" end="00:22:26.520" style="s2">but but to leave you know a bit around</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.850" end="00:22:28.910" style="s2">the nothing itself without you having to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.520" end="00:22:30.750" style="s2">do anything is active</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.910" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">that&#39;s what how do you guess it does</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.750" end="00:22:34.830" style="s2">nice nice tit</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:37.980" style="s2">there&#39;s the nothing nine lights and the</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.100" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">can think of the human being is always</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.210" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">walking on the edge between the nothing</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:20.910" style="s2">perceive so say say for example think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.380" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">a thing thing with very practical</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.910" end="00:23:28.410" style="s2">example maybe you choose to to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:31.559" style="s2">follow a certain path in your life that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.410" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">is only possible by in that sense then</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:43.350" style="s2">also a great destroyer yeah that then is</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.250" end="00:23:46.160" style="s2">the utter responsibility that you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.350" end="00:23:47.280" style="s2">as a human being is not to become an</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">itself that&#39;s wrong with that but we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.480" end="00:24:34.800" style="s2">become extremely destructive forces if</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:38.420" style="s2">you like right so and and for Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.800" end="00:24:42.210" style="s2">I think we are is even more destructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.420" end="00:24:44.910" style="s2">if we don&#39;t face up to death I said it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.210" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">gives us nothing to actualize which</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.910" end="00:24:51.780" style="s2">means that that&#39;s just this you you hit</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">a brick wall you hit a wall that you but</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.780" end="00:24:56.070" style="s2">once I think what what he calls running</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:24:59.400" style="s2">forth towards death</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">pushing or anticipating death is</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.400" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">ultimately and in in reading being in</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:11.060" style="s2">time for example and exercise if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:13.590" style="s2">like a spiritual exercise where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.060" end="00:25:15.960" style="s2">experience of ecstatic temporalities</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.590" end="00:25:19.140" style="s2">becomes possible and that&#39;s a totally</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.960" end="00:25:22.710" style="s2">different way of being with and in time</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.140" end="00:25:24.810" style="s2">then the way we are you know I will</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.710" end="00:25:26.910" style="s2">usually and think of time yes and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.810" end="00:25:29.340" style="s2">have to and we have to think of time to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.910" end="00:25:32.790" style="s2">go about our day which is its whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.340" end="00:25:36.950" style="s2">time now and it&#39;s all linear time passes</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.790" end="00:25:41.130" style="s2">right but fatigue I think ecstatic time</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.950" end="00:25:45.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t pass it arises right and as it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.130" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">arises it gives way so it&#39;s a constant</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.450" end="00:25:51.000" style="s2">gifting and giving anybody giving it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:55.170" style="s2">like is it because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.000" end="00:25:57.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed about about just just when</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.170" end="00:26:00.530" style="s2">you go and just find yourself like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.630" end="00:26:03.560" style="s2">look down and you&#39;re already begun like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.530" end="00:26:07.500" style="s2">like when I go and kind of go alright so</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.560" end="00:26:09.590" style="s2">where am I the where has already begun</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.500" end="00:26:14.130" style="s2">and everything like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.590" end="00:26:18.200" style="s2">the ecstatic awareness of it is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.130" end="00:26:22.680" style="s2">or already has arisen and I&#39;m somehow I</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.200" end="00:26:26.130" style="s2">think that this this sense of the one</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.680" end="00:26:28.890" style="s2">the one who does become aware yeah has</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.130" end="00:26:30.780" style="s2">this quality of illness already it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.890" end="00:26:32.820" style="s2">already begun like I can&#39;t get behind</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.780" end="00:26:34.409" style="s2">myself and push myself forward which i</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.820" end="00:26:38.009" style="s2">think is like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.409" end="00:26:41.370" style="s2">it seems like a lot of American kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.009" end="00:26:42.990" style="s2">psychological stuff is has this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.370" end="00:26:45.929" style="s2">presupposition that like you can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.990" end="00:26:48.000" style="s2">create yourself you can see and push</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.929" end="00:26:50.820" style="s2">yourself out yeah there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.000" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">embeddedness is that is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.820" end="00:26:54.539" style="s2">talking about is that the core is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:57.630" style="s2">kind of an aspect or starts to get in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.539" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">the way of the quality of time is is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.630" end="00:27:04.409" style="s2">it it comes kind of from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:07.470" style="s2">yeah the bottom up yeah it works through</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.409" end="00:27:10.799" style="s2">you to a certain degree it is you my god</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.470" end="00:27:14.009" style="s2">is this like death that&#39;s why he says</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.799" end="00:27:16.620" style="s2">you know original time is finite yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.009" end="00:27:19.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no times designs temporality</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.620" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that we are the center</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.230" end="00:27:24.440" style="s2">of the universe it just means that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">way we are is so fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.440" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">ecstatically temporal right he could not</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:33.929" style="s2">have abstract from it and the example</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:35.610" style="s2">you just gave is you know is although is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.929" end="00:27:38.610" style="s2">frightening on the one hand but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.610" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">also just on point because what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.610" end="00:27:49.470" style="s2">assumes like create yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">know everyday with it you know to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.470" end="00:27:56.220" style="s2">certain degree it&#39;s quite French if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:28:00.750" style="s2">want to throw and Sean Paul you call him</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.220" end="00:28:03.419" style="s2">saath saath wit from Paul right to a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.750" end="00:28:05.850" style="s2">certain degree says exactly that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.419" end="00:28:09.330" style="s2">right he says that existence comes</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.850" end="00:28:12.059" style="s2">before essence and that means that Ness</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.330" end="00:28:14.279" style="s2">comes before Watson as&#39; and almost from</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.059" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">a nominal to speak in the content term</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.279" end="00:28:20.879" style="s2">what Roman numerals fear which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:25.019" style="s2">timeless and only accessible to certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.879" end="00:28:27.779" style="s2">part of human reason can you then posit</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.019" end="00:28:30.929" style="s2">yourself your own that that you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.779" end="00:28:34.379" style="s2">which is existence and from that move on</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.929" end="00:28:36.059" style="s2">to whatever you want to be right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.379" end="00:28:40.620" style="s2">so it&#39;s even it&#39;s even worse it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.059" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">you you you make yourself um not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.620" end="00:28:44.100" style="s2">mean this is why I start the scientist</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:47.620" style="s2">reading of hiding it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.100" end="00:28:50.590" style="s2">completely misguided because he</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.620" end="00:28:53.020" style="s2">that leads Heidegger and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.590" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">one of the most brilliant mistakes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.020" end="00:29:00.250" style="s2">philosophy it seeks yes you know and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">very modern so he is very modern reading</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.250" end="00:29:07.570" style="s2">of Heidegger and hiding it just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:09.460" style="s2">to something else entirely</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.570" end="00:29:11.470" style="s2">we just you were thrown this is why he</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.460" end="00:29:14.470" style="s2">speaks of give orphan high right balance</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.470" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">thrown into the world yes and that means</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.470" end="00:29:20.170" style="s2">you haven&#39;t decided to be here yes you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.559" end="00:29:22.900" style="s2">know what no one asks you to be born</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.170" end="00:29:25.690" style="s2">no one asked me to be born and we were</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.900" end="00:29:29.380" style="s2">never asked do you want to have these</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.690" end="00:29:33.240" style="s2">parents these are they okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.380" end="00:29:33.240" style="s2">most most people some people might say</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:38.650" style="s2">you know but so you have so you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:41.350" style="s2">choose that he didn&#39;t choose what he</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.650" end="00:29:43.000" style="s2">look like you didn&#39;t choose anything to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.350" end="00:29:44.770" style="s2">certain degree yeah you didn&#39;t choose</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.000" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">some language he were born into and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.770" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">language makes up the way the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:52.870" style="s2">opens up to you yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:53.920" style="s2">you didn&#39;t chose the epoch you literally</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.870" end="00:29:56.400" style="s2">throw in through the world and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.920" end="00:29:59.350" style="s2">trying to make sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.400" end="00:30:01.630" style="s2">but the the modern way of going about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.350" end="00:30:06.150" style="s2">is in the one hand we are in charge</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.630" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">anyways yeah and we&#39;re like I&#39;m like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.150" end="00:30:12.040" style="s2">lab Ninian monad that&#39;s just all</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:13.510" style="s2">consuming and devouring I mean it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.040" end="00:30:15.370" style="s2">interesting that in modernity you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.510" end="00:30:17.800" style="s2">you know the will is very important the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.370" end="00:30:19.540" style="s2">cannot vez that&#39;s what the Latin word</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.800" end="00:30:23.610" style="s2">for it and Spinoza&#39;s like a never</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.540" end="00:30:27.070" style="s2">devouring will the the monad which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.610" end="00:30:29.920" style="s2">almost like a you know a single</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.070" end="00:30:31.480" style="s2">substance just to itself there&#39;s many of</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.090" end="00:32:55.780" style="s2">just has a very good critique of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.830" end="00:32:58.450" style="s2">neoliberalism so yes and Foucault does</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.400" end="00:33:03.370" style="s2">about modernity as well is everyone&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.370" end="00:33:09.910" style="s2">I mean look there&#39;s structural reasons</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.340" end="00:33:12.280" style="s2">why these critical systems like you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.910" end="00:33:13.040" style="s2">Google evaluations and TripAdvisor</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.280" end="00:33:16.070" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.040" end="00:33:18.170" style="s2">everyone&#39;s a food critic now but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.070" end="00:33:19.610" style="s2">nothing psychological about that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.170" end="00:33:22.100" style="s2">something structural about that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.610" end="00:33:24.260" style="s2">reason is that modernity itself or post</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.100" end="00:33:26.210" style="s2">learn see it&#39;s just criticism for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.260" end="00:33:27.950" style="s2">sake of criticism of batik was a routine</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.210" end="00:33:29.660" style="s2">and when hiding it does is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.950" end="00:33:31.640" style="s2">else where he doesn&#39;t keep - certainly</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.660" end="00:33:33.980" style="s2">yes he critiques modernity if you like</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.640" end="00:33:37.310" style="s2">yes but he gives you a solution I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.980" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">not not a solution one fits all but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.310" end="00:33:43.430" style="s2">it&#39;s uh it&#39;s exits like there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:47.480" style="s2">out and those aren&#39;t exactly in time</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.430" end="00:33:49.700" style="s2">like exactly in yes as you put it I once</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.480" end="00:33:52.340" style="s2">when you read this you realize oh I can</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.700" end="00:33:54.980" style="s2">actually like I can&#39;t actually abstract</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.340" end="00:33:56.990" style="s2">from everything that is I and then leap</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.980" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">back into whatever I want but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.990" end="00:34:02.780" style="s2">always already working through me coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.270" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">yeah you know what washing up against</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.780" end="00:34:08.270" style="s2">Smith however you want to put it itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:11.810" style="s2">yeah like I can&#39;t ever get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.270" end="00:34:14.929" style="s2">background to the floor like like no</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.810" end="00:34:17.690" style="s2">yeah yeah I get the back be rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.929" end="00:34:19.520" style="s2">background right which whatever because</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.690" end="00:34:21.530" style="s2">without background no foreground</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.520" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">exactly and that&#39;s kind of ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.530" end="00:34:25.250" style="s2">structure right if you will I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:28.880" style="s2">if the structure is the right word but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.250" end="00:34:31.850" style="s2">like yeah that said I mean look I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.880" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">of it as a I you have to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.850" end="00:34:33.890" style="s2">sense of things in your own words right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:35.780" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.890" end="00:34:37.130" style="s2">so the structure is I think fine you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.780" end="00:34:40.700" style="s2">could think of it as a structure ring</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.130" end="00:34:41.390" style="s2">yes it&#39;s always red all always already</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:43.310" style="s2">in motion</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.390" end="00:34:47.179" style="s2">yeah yeesh on that that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.310" end="00:34:49.010" style="s2">always already means that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.179" end="00:34:51.830" style="s2">chosen yourself because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.010" end="00:34:53.780" style="s2">something always already working through</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.830" end="00:34:55.610" style="s2">it&#39;s always already you are always</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.780" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">already thrown you&#39;re always already</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.610" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">being towards death and you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:05.870" style="s2">thing is you&#39;re weird towards death</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:08.360" style="s2">anyways yeah yeah um and then but then</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.870" end="00:35:11.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not a willful choice to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.360" end="00:35:12.950" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be running first towards my</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.090" end="00:35:19.580" style="s2">death and just accepted well I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.950" end="00:35:26.600" style="s2">there&#39;s this something it&#39;s it is a so</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.580" end="00:35:30.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not morbid or or or a reduction</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.600" end="00:35:33.340" style="s2">to death but or to immortality but what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.200" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">Heidegger wants or wishes that once</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.340" end="00:35:42.470" style="s2">which is us to do asks us to maybe ask</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:44.870" style="s2">us to do is to let go and to let go</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.470" end="00:35:47.330" style="s2">means that you and that so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.870" end="00:35:50.060" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s not a leap in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.330" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">you walk towards a certain cliff then</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.060" end="00:35:56.570" style="s2">you see the necessity to leap down into</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:36:00.020" style="s2">something yeah he he lets I asked him</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.570" end="00:36:02.180" style="s2">the leap that happens in his in that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.020" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">must happen in this thinking is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.180" end="00:36:08.120" style="s2">letting go of anything familiar and once</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:10.130" style="s2">that happens you let go of with you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.120" end="00:36:12.920" style="s2">beings that signs of everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.130" end="00:36:15.320" style="s2">graspable right don&#39;t you don&#39;t you you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.920" end="00:36:18.200" style="s2">cannot fall back to these metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.320" end="00:36:20.590" style="s2">expertise also being is just reality OB</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.200" end="00:36:25.370" style="s2">is just an ultimate Oh being is just God</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.590" end="00:36:29.240" style="s2">no being is and that that&#39;s the later</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.370" end="00:36:32.090" style="s2">Heidegger to leap into the Terek text</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.240" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s being is what he calls a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.090" end="00:36:37.730" style="s2">vagueness to a certain degrees is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:41.630" style="s2">that which that that which as it comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.730" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">into its own withdraws and absconds and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.630" end="00:36:46.700" style="s2">but but that&#39;s at one simultaneous and</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:49.150" style="s2">this is something that you might not</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.700" end="00:36:51.500" style="s2">have heard yet because these are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.150" end="00:36:55.640" style="s2">obscure tax I&#39;m just going to mention it</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.500" end="00:37:01.220" style="s2">Heidegger begins to call death the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.640" end="00:37:02.990" style="s2">mountain range of being and the way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.220" end="00:37:05.090" style="s2">so in the Trevon word and this is is</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.990" end="00:37:09.410" style="s2">gonna make little little sense to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.090" end="00:37:11.960" style="s2">is for for mountain ranges get big which</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.410" end="00:37:14.570" style="s2">which hiding understands and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.960" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">etymologically correct or anything but</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.570" end="00:37:20.900" style="s2">he understands that as the concentration</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">or gathering of sheltering harboring</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.900" end="00:37:26.780" style="s2">concealment so because there&#39;s the verb</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:28.760" style="s2">balgan in hippie like if you he hears</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.780" end="00:37:32.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s probably not really there but</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.760" end="00:37:35.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what he hears in it anyway and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.870" end="00:37:37.730" style="s2">you can think of if death is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.390" end="00:37:40.420" style="s2">mountain range of being and we are</p>

<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:48.010" style="s2">being and the history of being if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.150" end="00:41:49.860" style="s2">think of us as mortals I think what</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.010" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">hiding is trying to say is if we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.860" end="00:41:55.600" style="s2">then it took me years to say understand</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.250" end="00:42:22.900" style="s2">occur in and off itself so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.230" end="00:42:25.750" style="s2">find a plateau way to live on and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.900" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">move on etc and and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.750" end="00:42:30.760" style="s2">experience of what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:33.700" style="s2">and respond to that I think for</p>

<p begin="00:45:06.990" end="00:45:11.640" style="s2">different feeling in the older cities</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.369" end="00:45:19.800" style="s2">then yeah like then like say you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.640" end="00:45:22.980" style="s2">Phoenix is like Phoenix La La&#39;s yeah its</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.800" end="00:45:24.750" style="s2">own universe but yeah like well because</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.980" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">one of the things that in older cities</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.750" end="00:45:29.430" style="s2">in America you know you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:31.230" style="s2">you know they&#39;re not even old compared</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.430" end="00:45:35.160" style="s2">to Europe I mean I don&#39;t even think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.230" end="00:45:37.109" style="s2">have any sense of like idea I know what</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.160" end="00:45:40.380" style="s2">I went to when I went and started</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.109" end="00:45:42.180" style="s2">leading courses in Europe yeah walking</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.380" end="00:45:44.580" style="s2">bah I was just like driving down the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.180" end="00:45:47.790" style="s2">road and looking at you know there&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.580" end="00:45:51.180" style="s2">this look like a thousand years old or</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.790" end="00:45:53.190" style="s2">something right of just this built-up</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.180" end="00:45:55.349" style="s2">building that&#39;s been there forever with</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.190" end="00:45:57.599" style="s2">like a maybe an addition built on to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.349" end="00:46:00.690" style="s2">and people are just walking by as if</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:46:06.260" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not into me it was just like I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.690" end="00:46:10.830" style="s2">had no Drock that you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.260" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">greenhouses are like ancient yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.830" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">the but there&#39;s such a different feeling</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.339" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s kind of probably what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">what Heidegger and what you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.339" end="00:46:23.070" style="s2">getting at I think as in there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:25.800" style="s2">of place where because the the old</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.070" end="00:46:27.990" style="s2">because a city would converge with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.800" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">railroads so it&#39;s like as the railroads</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.990" end="00:46:32.940" style="s2">would all converge it would get</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">more concentrated right and then right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.940" end="00:46:37.230" style="s2">where it converged was like the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:40.140" style="s2">concentrated part of the city in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.230" end="00:46:41.910" style="s2">sense of time right where everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.140" end="00:46:43.619" style="s2">kind of built on top of each other and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.910" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">you have these layers of different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.619" end="00:46:47.310" style="s2">of buildings and they&#39;re like they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:49.950" style="s2">to adjust to themselves and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.310" end="00:46:51.690" style="s2">it&#39;d be a the city of merges right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.950" end="00:46:53.250" style="s2">then that there&#39;s a sensibility with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.690" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">lot of them others like a town square</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.250" end="00:47:00.300" style="s2">there&#39;s like a center right with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:02.460" style="s2">church or like a park around it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.300" end="00:47:07.430" style="s2">like everything you can get this quality</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.460" end="00:47:10.859" style="s2">of like emergence out of yeah yeah where</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.430" end="00:47:14.250" style="s2">my son my son lives in Plano Texas which</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.859" end="00:47:15.660" style="s2">is just absolutely the worst I could be</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.250" end="00:47:17.609" style="s2">there for about three days and after</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.660" end="00:47:20.460" style="s2">that I like I either need to take like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.609" end="00:47:25.770" style="s2">lots of prozac or I gotta get out of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.460" end="00:47:31.140" style="s2">there um but they literally they they</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.770" end="00:47:34.020" style="s2">built a town yeah is and it was you</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.140" end="00:47:37.290" style="s2">could tell it was for a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.020" end="00:47:40.560" style="s2">consumer so everything right is built</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.290" end="00:47:42.900" style="s2">for the consumer yep and it is come it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.560" end="00:47:45.869" style="s2">like a completely different place to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.900" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">yeah and everything&#39;s ina like is</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.869" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">ordered right is accessible huh but but</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:58.349" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s not you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:48:00.300" style="s2">not I mean that&#39;s you know sad yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.349" end="00:48:03.420" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t an American problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.300" end="00:48:05.310" style="s2">I would not you know all that a world</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.420" end="00:48:10.770" style="s2">problem because I think what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.310" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">and I mean yes you have because you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.770" end="00:48:15.300" style="s2">cities start somewhere they have a heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:17.490" style="s2">right there usually so for example my</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.300" end="00:48:20.130" style="s2">city is called my hometown is called</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.490" end="00:48:23.550" style="s2">Alex book which means the castle of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.130" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">Augustus Augustus was a Roman Empire mmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.550" end="00:48:31.020" style="s2">Emperor who seventeen before Christ</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:34.020" style="s2">fifteen before Christ when ever camped</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.020" end="00:48:36.270" style="s2">where we now have Augsburg up on a hill</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.020" end="00:48:39.470" style="s2">obviously because that makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.270" end="00:48:44.540" style="s2">the Opera Hills you can get attacked</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.470" end="00:48:49.700" style="s2">that around that original camp and he</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.540" end="00:48:53.060" style="s2">tried to breach into jimana further and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.700" end="00:48:55.640" style="s2">take the rest of the the region</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.060" end="00:48:59.770" style="s2">therefore for the Roman Empire which</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.640" end="00:49:02.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t really happen that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.770" end="00:49:05.410" style="s2">became a focal point and then slowly</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.780" end="00:49:08.420" style="s2">developed and it develops organically</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.410" end="00:49:11.990" style="s2">but it takes time again we&#39;re back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.420" end="00:49:14.300" style="s2">time right in our age we don&#39;t take time</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.990" end="00:49:17.540" style="s2">it&#39;s just as you say you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.300" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">that place in Texas is built for its</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.540" end="00:49:24.260" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s but it&#39;s built for what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:28.760" style="s2">not built for you could say so the camp</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.260" end="00:49:31.580" style="s2">was set up by Augustus to have a base</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.760" end="00:49:35.080" style="s2">from where he could branch out into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.580" end="00:49:38.660" style="s2">woods and then take the lands from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.080" end="00:49:40.369" style="s2">originally too tramatic tribes then it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.660" end="00:49:44.330" style="s2">became something else it became it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.369" end="00:49:46.550" style="s2">attracts tradesmen it attracts craftsmen</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.330" end="00:49:49.700" style="s2">because wherever there&#39;s power and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.550" end="00:49:52.490" style="s2">political power that&#39;s money as of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.700" end="00:49:54.440" style="s2">attracts and then it free</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.490" end="00:49:57.250" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t know the reasons because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.440" end="00:50:00.170" style="s2">not a historian but the camp remained</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.250" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">and it was built up and it became a city</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.170" end="00:50:06.140" style="s2">but that takes time maybe 50 years maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:08.300" style="s2">a hundred years and then slowly it grows</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.140" end="00:50:12.680" style="s2">over now it&#39;s a two thousand-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.300" end="00:50:14.390" style="s2">settlement right where and there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.680" end="00:50:16.130" style="s2">of the sensations I had when I lived in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.390" end="00:50:19.369" style="s2">Seattle eight years ago for about six</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.130" end="00:50:21.380" style="s2">months was that this is the I had the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.369" end="00:50:23.330" style="s2">very clear feeling this is and I lived</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.380" end="00:50:25.310" style="s2">in Capitol Hill which is very very</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.330" end="00:50:29.000" style="s2">central you know I thought that this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.310" end="00:50:31.609" style="s2">the this is wilderness and the trees</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.000" end="00:50:35.690" style="s2">look wild to compare to the trees in</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.609" end="00:50:40.220" style="s2">Europe I felt like animals like foxes</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.690" end="00:50:41.450" style="s2">and one hurling around at night yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.220" end="00:50:43.250" style="s2">I saw them and they looked at me like</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.450" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">you have no idea what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.250" end="00:50:51.190" style="s2">because it is all so new it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:53.140" style="s2">that&#39;s how I felt when I to Europe I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.190" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">thought okay now I&#39;m walking on ground</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.140" end="00:50:56.920" style="s2">again huh</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.270" style="s2">walking I have this substance I mean Oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.920" end="00:51:01.300" style="s2">Heidegger and shouldn&#39;t speak of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.270" end="00:51:02.920" style="s2">substance but anyway so there was there</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.300" end="00:51:04.870" style="s2">was a ground again but I will say this</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.920" end="00:51:10.260" style="s2">about you know the American experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.870" end="00:51:13.510" style="s2">is that you are free from metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.260" end="00:51:18.430" style="s2">and that you know it leads to these</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.510" end="00:51:21.010" style="s2">hideous like McDonald&#39;s KFC gas station</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.430" end="00:51:22.690" style="s2">shopping mall Walmart and then you drive</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.010" end="00:51:24.820" style="s2">into town and everything&#39;s dead you</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.690" end="00:51:28.810" style="s2">drive out again but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.820" end="00:51:31.540" style="s2">that freedom also has a certain hat is</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.810" end="00:51:33.490" style="s2">is a freedom also in a you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.540" end="00:51:36.370" style="s2">positive sense it gives you an openness</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.490" end="00:51:39.250" style="s2">to ways of thinking you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.370" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">then hiding it might be after as well so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.250" end="00:51:44.290" style="s2">it isn&#39;t you know it always comes in</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:47.080" style="s2">there&#39;s not it&#39;s never just but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.290" end="00:51:48.700" style="s2">cannot have peace without or like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.080" end="00:51:50.590" style="s2">cannot have just as well and just as</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.700" end="00:51:52.870" style="s2">variety gets always freedom is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.590" end="00:51:56.800" style="s2">unfreedom and just to mention this in</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.870" end="00:52:00.010" style="s2">our age I think and this epoch the task</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.800" end="00:52:03.070" style="s2">of the human being is to withold</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.010" end="00:52:05.740" style="s2">withstand live the freedom that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.070" end="00:52:08.140" style="s2">experience in terms of technology coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.740" end="00:52:10.510" style="s2">in and things being extremely weird and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.140" end="00:52:13.110" style="s2">strange to anyone who&#39;s awake everyone</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.510" end="00:52:15.250" style="s2">else is you know kind of lost anyways</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.110" end="00:52:17.140" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in Europe though is</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.250" end="00:52:19.150" style="s2">it&#39;s not so what you&#39;re describing there</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.140" end="00:52:20.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not just something American and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.150" end="00:52:22.840" style="s2">not going to make a political point of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.710" end="00:52:24.340" style="s2">saying oh oh the American Empire is just</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.840" end="00:52:28.210" style="s2">reaching out therefore it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.340" end="00:52:31.960" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s everywhere yeah but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.210" end="00:52:33.880" style="s2">there must be an openness to in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.960" end="00:52:36.250" style="s2">to want something like that because we</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.880" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">have these suburbs as well that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.250" end="00:52:42.100" style="s2">faceless right they don&#39;t even have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.400" end="00:52:44.230" style="s2">proper facade there&#39;s just there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.100" end="00:52:47.110" style="s2">places in like Venice Beach works of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.230" end="00:52:51.010" style="s2">limit and then in LA that have much more</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.110" end="00:52:53.620" style="s2">of a feel of place than many of the new</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.620" end="00:52:59.320" style="s2">40 years or so in Germany for example of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.130" end="00:53:01.390" style="s2">suburbs that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.320" end="00:53:05.560" style="s2">really dead and they&#39;re all just there</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.390" end="00:53:08.590" style="s2">to park people when they come back from</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.560" end="00:53:10.870" style="s2">their nine-to-five and and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.590" end="00:53:13.500" style="s2">do the routine of television or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.870" end="00:53:16.600" style="s2">else you have to do it to be the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.500" end="00:53:18.910" style="s2">you know the consumer yes that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.600" end="00:53:20.920" style="s2">what we are obviously we recalled</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.910" end="00:53:22.900" style="s2">consumers right I mean fabric alpha is</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.920" end="00:53:26.820" style="s2">like a normal which is consumer is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.900" end="00:53:29.530" style="s2">normal regular term used by politicians</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.820" end="00:53:31.390" style="s2">right listen row and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.530" end="00:53:34.120" style="s2">else look at look at a place like London</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.390" end="00:53:38.650" style="s2">London is another 2,000 year old Roman</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.120" end="00:53:40.600" style="s2">settlement and of course it&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.650" end="00:53:44.350" style="s2">real history there was a huge fire and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.600" end="00:53:46.870" style="s2">some time in early modern times and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.350" end="00:53:51.490" style="s2">was destroyed by Nazi bombings in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.870" end="00:53:56.350" style="s2">Second World War but it it always sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.490" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">of maintained its its uniqueness but</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.350" end="00:54:00.660" style="s2">what&#39;s happening now I said there are</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:04.120" style="s2">skyscrapers going up everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.660" end="00:54:05.980" style="s2">there are they&#39;re not beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.120" end="00:54:08.530" style="s2">buildings like the Empire State Building</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.980" end="00:54:10.240" style="s2">because the Empire State Building is you</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.530" end="00:54:14.200" style="s2">know classical it&#39;s a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.240" end="00:54:17.620" style="s2">architecture yeah but it&#39;s just these</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.200" end="00:54:19.180" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.620" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">taste it&#39;s that there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.180" end="00:54:23.260" style="s2">happening here there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:26.770" style="s2">showing itself it&#39;s just glass and steel</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.260" end="00:54:29.370" style="s2">and concrete right so and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.770" end="00:54:32.280" style="s2">and I&#39;ve mentioned this in another</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.370" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">conversation event with Justin Murphy</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.280" end="00:54:36.460" style="s2">it&#39;s also up on YouTube so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:39.550" style="s2">repeating myself but I&#39;m just gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.460" end="00:54:40.870" style="s2">anyway is that there&#39;s one building</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.550" end="00:54:45.790" style="s2">called maybe you&#39;ve heard of it called</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.870" end="00:54:47.620" style="s2">the shard yeah a shard so it&#39;s a shot</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.790" end="00:54:50.620" style="s2">it&#39;s literally a shard that you break</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.620" end="00:54:52.090" style="s2">glass and you have a chance right and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.620" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">looks unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.090" end="00:54:57.700" style="s2">it looks like a dystopian techno version</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:54:58.210" style="s2">of the evil eye that Sargon or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.700" end="00:55:01.240" style="s2">it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.210" end="00:55:03.910" style="s2">Sauron alone I think it is yeah for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.240" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">Rings yes Mike because it&#39;s got these</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.910" end="00:55:08.680" style="s2">hideous red lights so the you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:12.339" style="s2">airplane some crash crash into it right</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.680" end="00:55:15.670" style="s2">but it is a shard it cuts so it&#39;s unfit</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.339" end="00:55:18.999" style="s2">looks like it&#39;s unfinished yes and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.670" end="00:55:21.039" style="s2">cuts into the sky cuts into the sky</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.999" end="00:55:22.779" style="s2">that&#39;s how I interpreted you know I look</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.039" end="00:55:26.619" style="s2">at it and it just literally cuts into</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.779" end="00:55:29.859" style="s2">the sky but who lives who inhabits the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.619" end="00:55:33.009" style="s2">sky its gods its immortals yeah right so</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.859" end="00:55:35.170" style="s2">it&#39;s all its it why is this I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.009" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">know you could always say it&#39;s just some</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.170" end="00:55:43.960" style="s2">idiot architect but if it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:46.599" style="s2">about subjective psychological it made</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.960" end="00:55:49.569" style="s2">sense yeah there there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.599" end="00:55:52.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something that in a terrible in</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.569" end="00:55:54.729" style="s2">a in a very terrible way makes sense for</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.119" end="00:55:57.430" style="s2">this epoch yes then it would happen now</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.729" end="00:56:01.719" style="s2">that you would that build a temple in</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.430" end="00:56:03.609" style="s2">honor of Apollo or a church right in</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.719" end="00:56:07.589" style="s2">honor of the Christian God or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.609" end="00:56:09.880" style="s2">synagogue an order of honor of Yahoo</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.589" end="00:56:13.119" style="s2">mosque in that sense but no you build</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.880" end="00:56:15.160" style="s2">the building called the shard that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:19.059" style="s2">the tallest building up until this day</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.160" end="00:56:23.579" style="s2">in Western Europe and that cuts into for</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.059" end="00:56:26.259" style="s2">the sky and in that sense is you know is</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.579" end="00:56:28.180" style="s2">meaningfully destructive but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.259" end="00:56:31.869" style="s2">what&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s what the purpose is</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.180" end="00:56:34.900" style="s2">right and it has that there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.869" end="00:56:39.489" style="s2">beautiful about it except that all it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.900" end="00:56:42.309" style="s2">it&#39;s tall it&#39;s really tall so it did</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.489" end="00:56:46.539" style="s2">this there&#39;s this yeah and I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.309" end="00:56:50.200" style="s2">think you know if that strangeness can</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.539" end="00:56:51.789" style="s2">you imagine another epoch where where</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.200" end="00:56:54.309" style="s2">anyone would have built a building</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.789" end="00:56:57.130" style="s2">that&#39;s called the shard cutting into</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.309" end="00:57:00.460" style="s2">something into yeah what why is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.130" end="00:57:03.969" style="s2">yes that&#39;s hideous it&#39;s just absurd but</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.460" end="00:57:15.339" style="s2">you know pointing this out to people</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.969" end="00:57:17.380" style="s2">will get you looks can I can I ask you</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.339" end="00:57:21.369" style="s2">something so like a little bit I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.380" end="00:57:23.559" style="s2">to hear um so just first of all like I</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.369" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">really appreciate it like appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.559" end="00:57:25.990" style="s2">really appreciated all your videos and</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:27.880" style="s2">in there</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.990" end="00:57:29.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a something and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.880" end="00:57:32.380" style="s2">I can describe it but there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.470" end="00:57:35.980" style="s2">a way in which you speak about these</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.380" end="00:57:39.310" style="s2">things and in it it reveals of a being</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.980" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">deeply touched by it like there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.310" end="00:57:44.200" style="s2">wait as you&#39;re talking these you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:45.910" style="s2">get the sense of high level of</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.200" end="00:57:46.540" style="s2">abstractions although they are in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.910" end="00:57:49.960" style="s2">respect</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.540" end="00:57:52.030" style="s2">there&#39;s your like grappling with it</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.960" end="00:57:53.860" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s coming from deep in you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.030" end="00:57:55.030" style="s2">like it&#39;s almost like I asked you a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.860" end="00:57:56.710" style="s2">question and we&#39;re just like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.030" end="00:57:58.119" style="s2">already been thinking about you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.710" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">just thinking about it or something</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.119" end="00:58:03.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something a sense of wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:06.250" style="s2">with something and being touched by it</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.190" end="00:58:08.860" style="s2">or moved by it like what what is your</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.250" end="00:58:12.580" style="s2">experience of what&#39;s your personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.860" end="00:58:17.110" style="s2">experience of the philosophy and how do</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.580" end="00:58:22.210" style="s2">you you if it does and like what what</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.110" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">about it at reduce would deeply like</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.210" end="00:58:25.540" style="s2">before like when did you start for</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:28.690" style="s2">example like when did you start reading</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.540" end="00:58:33.910" style="s2">Heidegger yeah like what was life like</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.690" end="00:58:37.090" style="s2">before that and after that I it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.910" end="00:58:40.780" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a very important question</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.090" end="00:58:43.060" style="s2">I guess I couldn&#39;t let me answer with</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.780" end="00:58:45.790" style="s2">Hegel and then I&#39;ll I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.060" end="00:58:47.710" style="s2">myself Hegel somewhere says in him</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.790" end="00:58:51.790" style="s2">paraphrasing him then the the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.710" end="00:58:55.060" style="s2">philosopher dies every day from worry we</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.790" end="00:59:00.580" style="s2">could the philosopher worries about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.060" end="00:59:04.570" style="s2">about the world and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.580" end="00:59:08.560" style="s2">something if I could have distanced</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.570" end="00:59:10.510" style="s2">myself from myself for a minute there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.560" end="00:59:15.430" style="s2">something I&#39;m very aware of myself I</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.510" end="00:59:18.340" style="s2">have I think an extreme self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.430" end="00:59:20.710" style="s2">in terms of what my thinking is some of</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.340" end="00:59:23.350" style="s2">my experiences the philosophy for me</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.710" end="00:59:24.820" style="s2">isn&#39;t intellectual I can get into all</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.350" end="00:59:27.130" style="s2">this intellectual douchebaggery and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.820" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">very good at you know look I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.130" end="00:59:32.440" style="s2">at this argument taking it apart but yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:35.109" style="s2">that there&#39;s something that that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.440" end="00:59:39.160" style="s2">don&#39;t come across as an intellect you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.109" end="00:59:41.350" style="s2">come across as the living it or</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.160" end="00:59:45.700" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s close to you you&#39;re grappling</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.350" end="00:59:49.720" style="s2">yeah it is closing its it that&#39;s yes and</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.700" end="00:59:53.230" style="s2">it&#39;s always been close I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.720" end="00:59:59.250" style="s2">things I yeah I was not very good at</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.230" end="00:59:59.250" style="s2">school reason being what&#39;s cool is like</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.290" end="01:00:07.660" style="s2">supportive that&#39;s whatever you know in</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.010" end="01:00:09.040" style="s2">Germany you go to elementary school</p>

<p begin="01:00:48.270" end="01:00:54.310" style="s2">would think the the British call grammar</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.850" end="01:00:57.490" style="s2">school so we you&#39;ll learn Latin and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.310" end="01:01:04.540" style="s2">ancient Greek rather than something you</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.490" end="01:01:07.840" style="s2">can use right Spanish spending today</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.540" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">it&#39;s Spanish and Chinese yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.840" end="01:01:13.240" style="s2">something you can use like language is</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:15.370" style="s2">not something you use right it&#39;s that oh</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.240" end="01:01:21.190" style="s2">look I&#39;m just gonna look this is why you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.370" end="01:01:24.220" style="s2">get this is language is where we live</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.190" end="01:01:25.990" style="s2">and now it&#39;s not a tool you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.220" end="01:01:30.010" style="s2">just gonna learn some English tonight no</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.990" end="01:01:32.830" style="s2">I mean if the language and get a feeling</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.010" end="01:01:35.590" style="s2">for it and I think this is why I can get</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.830" end="01:01:38.620" style="s2">across all of this in a foreign non</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.590" end="01:01:42.820" style="s2">native language because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.620" end="01:01:45.670" style="s2">enter that house that is the English</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.820" end="01:01:51.300" style="s2">language so I&#39;m trying to speak from</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.670" end="01:01:53.460" style="s2">within the language itself and and I had</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.300" end="01:01:56.579" style="s2">it was mine or so I had</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.460" end="01:02:00.480" style="s2">very clear idea that if I learn Latin</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.579" end="01:02:04.050" style="s2">and ancient Greek and I would gain</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.480" end="01:02:06.710" style="s2">access to the mysteries of the world I</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.050" end="01:02:09.270" style="s2">have no idea where this is coming from</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.710" end="01:02:11.309" style="s2">why I had this idea because there was</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.270" end="01:02:15.089" style="s2">certainly I mean yes my parents you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.309" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">read a lot and I have to I have four</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.089" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">Greek names</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.750" end="01:02:24.780" style="s2">yeah Johannes and Leah&#39;s hemicycle Yanis</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.210" end="01:02:28.770" style="s2">is like a Greek version of I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.780" end="01:02:33.859" style="s2">a great version of a Hebrew name but I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.770" end="01:02:36.660" style="s2">don&#39;t know why but that that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.859" end="01:02:39.119" style="s2">that idea was with me when I was very</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.660" end="01:02:41.040" style="s2">young and I I went to this school and it</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.119" end="01:02:43.380" style="s2">was the exact opposite right it was just</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.040" end="01:02:45.990" style="s2">learning the grammar by heart aloha and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.380" end="01:02:50.579" style="s2">it took me years of suffering until I</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.990" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">had one good teacher who actually lost</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.579" end="01:02:56.099" style="s2">the ancient Greek language so much that</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:03:00.900" style="s2">I turned from a really bad student of</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.099" end="01:03:04.770" style="s2">pupil to really good understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.900" end="01:03:06.630" style="s2">the language and so I read all of the I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.770" end="01:03:08.250" style="s2">you know the pre-socratics as we</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.630" end="01:03:14.220" style="s2">categorize him now in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.250" end="01:03:17.609" style="s2">dialogues and homers a great great works</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.220" end="01:03:19.349" style="s2">and and and and Aristotle to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.609" end="01:03:22.079" style="s2">degree as well so I read all of this in</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.349" end="01:03:25.349" style="s2">the original there&#39;s there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:27.869" style="s2">there was always and and I always had</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.349" end="01:03:30.210" style="s2">the best understanding of Plato and of</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.869" end="01:03:32.730" style="s2">Heraclitus those were closest you had a</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.210" end="01:03:35.940" style="s2">very hard time translating everything so</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.730" end="01:03:37.619" style="s2">I I couldn&#39;t translate but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.940" end="01:03:42.420" style="s2">understand Riesling</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.619" end="01:03:44.099" style="s2">but in and then it but it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.420" end="01:03:45.809" style="s2">like you know I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.099" end="01:03:47.940" style="s2">about the Philosopher&#39;s that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.809" end="01:03:50.609" style="s2">always a certain feeling of a strange</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.940" end="01:03:55.849" style="s2">meant with everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.609" end="01:04:01.880" style="s2">yeah and I&#39;ve always had that right but</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.849" end="01:04:01.880" style="s2">it&#39;s and then I came to to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:06.579" style="s2">two pods on where I studied philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.359" end="01:04:10.209" style="s2">politics and economics and a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.579" end="01:04:14.140" style="s2">teacher who is also not you know an</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.209" end="01:04:15.910" style="s2">intellectual but he lives he lives this</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.140" end="01:04:22.569" style="s2">way of thinking because that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.910" end="01:04:23.890" style="s2">it is and then it all came back that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.569" end="01:04:25.539" style="s2">this kind of thing they do because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.890" end="01:04:27.910" style="s2">covered you know it was kind of it was</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.539" end="01:04:30.369" style="s2">gone for a while man I had left school</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.910" end="01:04:32.259" style="s2">and but it came back and ever since then</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.369" end="01:04:36.099" style="s2">which is now ten years ago I&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.259" end="01:04:38.890" style="s2">this very clear trajectory of having to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.099" end="01:04:40.539" style="s2">go deeper and deeper and deeper there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.890" end="01:04:43.929" style="s2">a there&#39;s something pulling me you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.539" end="01:04:48.729" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not exhausted</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.929" end="01:04:55.419" style="s2">yeah right it&#39;s very late it&#39;s very late</p>

<p begin="01:04:55.419" end="01:04:58.569" style="s2">a pole if you like that&#39;s how people</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.189" end="01:05:01.660" style="s2">describe it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.569" end="01:05:06.779" style="s2">that just it opens up anyway so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.660" end="01:05:09.549" style="s2">have to left yeah it&#39;s there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.779" end="01:05:11.130" style="s2">fully there I don&#39;t know why but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.549" end="01:05:14.439" style="s2">there and it&#39;s always been there and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.130" end="01:05:15.309" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s now it&#39;s thanks to Heidegger I</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.439" end="01:05:17.339" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.309" end="01:05:20.049" style="s2">thanks to Eva this novel was the</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.390" end="01:05:35.739" style="s2">come about right but it but it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.380" end="01:05:37.419" style="s2">but it feels like in in that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.739" end="01:05:40.839" style="s2">amor fati that it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.419" end="01:05:45.569" style="s2">necessary so I bet that&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.839" end="01:05:49.119" style="s2">not it&#39;s not work I&#39;m not this is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.569" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">excruciating or painful or get me off I</p>

<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:57.909" style="s2">looking up and everything else is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.429" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">mundane and and and kind of painful but</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.909" end="01:06:04.539" style="s2">this isn&#39;t and and and I had to and this</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:07.390" style="s2">is this I mean I have this is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.539" end="01:06:09.369" style="s2">sound extremely strange I was in mess</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.390" end="01:06:12.360" style="s2">kill two years ago for the first time</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.369" end="01:06:15.030" style="s2">which is hyda cos hometown</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.360" end="01:06:17.670" style="s2">and I think one of his and he&#39;s got two</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.030" end="01:06:20.130" style="s2">sons and one of them is his actual son</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.670" end="01:06:23.160" style="s2">Northam it&#39;s not his son he just raised</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.130" end="01:06:25.470" style="s2">him as his son yeah and his actual son I</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.160" end="01:06:27.390" style="s2">think was there or maybe the son of his</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.470" end="01:06:29.220" style="s2">son I&#39;m not sure but one of his</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.390" end="01:06:32.370" style="s2">relatives was there who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.220" end="01:06:35.880" style="s2">related siding her properly and if when</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.370" end="01:06:39.230" style="s2">I talk to him he&#39;s very old he it seemed</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.880" end="01:06:41.880" style="s2">like he knew me he thought he knew me</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.230" end="01:06:45.270" style="s2">because it was not because it was his</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.880" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">Terrace is familiarity right there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.270" end="01:06:51.540" style="s2">Ameli arity that that that&#39;s beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:52.980" style="s2">time that could probably also happen but</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.540" end="01:06:54.990" style="s2">if you met some other hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.980" end="01:06:58.200" style="s2">who have that kind of thinking as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.990" end="01:07:00.300" style="s2">yeah yeah that makes any sense but there</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.200" end="01:07:02.490" style="s2">is there&#39;s often the feeling yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.300" end="01:07:04.700" style="s2">familiar and I think this is why it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.490" end="01:07:23.190" style="s2">this weird world we live in where you</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.700" end="01:07:30.570" style="s2">stumble on some obscure video yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.190" end="01:07:32.700" style="s2">and and yeah but it&#39;s not theory that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.570" end="01:07:36.210" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean it is theory proper</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.700" end="01:07:39.150" style="s2">because the areia means to live to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.210" end="01:07:44.580" style="s2">actually try and live it and make sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.150" end="01:07:46.290" style="s2">of the world not in this it yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.580" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">abstract to a certain degree and you</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.290" end="01:07:50.940" style="s2">need to actually be very very strict and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:57.810" style="s2">need to be able to think in abstract</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.940" end="01:08:03.110" style="s2">terms and prevent it like I think what</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.810" end="01:08:05.430" style="s2">what my talent may be is is to make it</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.110" end="01:08:09.960" style="s2">understandable accessible without</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.430" end="01:08:12.870" style="s2">turning it into not not too accessible</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.960" end="01:08:14.610" style="s2">right it shouldn&#39;t be too clear or too</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.870" end="01:08:21.570" style="s2">easy because then it just becomes</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.610" end="01:08:23.940" style="s2">nothing again but I but but what it is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.570" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">and why there is this pull I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.940" end="01:08:32.060" style="s2">but I can&#39;t if if I would I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:35.640" style="s2">stop yeah I&#39;m looking back it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.060" end="01:08:38.490" style="s2">been like this I go to bold sound for no</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.640" end="01:08:43.890" style="s2">reason like literally I mean I met a guy</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.490" end="01:08:45.480" style="s2">who was in Augsburg accidentally right</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.890" end="01:08:47.940" style="s2">he tells me that there&#39;s the study</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.480" end="01:08:50.760" style="s2">program at this obscure you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.940" end="01:08:54.330" style="s2">ten-year-old University in bored sauna</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.760" end="01:08:56.130" style="s2">but that no one ever goes to yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.330" end="01:08:58.410" style="s2">not a special now it&#39;s a special place</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.130" end="01:09:01.200" style="s2">back then no one knew about it and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.410" end="01:09:04.200" style="s2">there&#39;s this gentleman you would hnr for</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.200" end="01:09:06.359" style="s2">who is teaches Heidegger the way he</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.200" end="01:09:07.740" style="s2">wants he doesn&#39;t care what other people</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.359" end="01:09:12.510" style="s2">say he doesn&#39;t care about anything and</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.740" end="01:09:16.080" style="s2">and for for some reason it all left me</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.510" end="01:09:17.550" style="s2">there and so he said I mean it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.080" end="01:09:20.280" style="s2">know if you have the time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.550" end="01:09:22.200" style="s2">video of of me and him on the channel oh</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.280" end="01:09:24.900" style="s2">is that the guy that we&#39;re he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.200" end="01:09:28.260" style="s2">about the essence of Technology yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.900" end="01:09:31.859" style="s2">yeah oh yeah he was something it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.260" end="01:09:36.630" style="s2">what about like three times yeah cuz he</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.859" end="01:09:38.970" style="s2">yeah he said he he made Joe for me like</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.630" end="01:09:41.070" style="s2">a bunny yeah the whole thing about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.970" end="01:09:45.180" style="s2">hit I think I finally understood what</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.070" end="01:09:48.420" style="s2">Heidegger meant by history history yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.180" end="01:09:50.100" style="s2">and in the new beginning that&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.420" end="01:09:52.470" style="s2">was always like a stop strange weather</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.100" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">is so elusive like a new beginning but</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.470" end="01:09:57.930" style="s2">that&#39;s that sense of going back and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:10:00.180" style="s2">looking at content and looking at</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.930" end="01:10:02.430" style="s2">Aristotle and this sense of the way that</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.180" end="01:10:06.300" style="s2">he described I really appreciated it</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.430" end="01:10:08.070" style="s2">like that there were terms that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.300" end="01:10:11.310" style="s2">took but they didn&#39;t take these other</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.070" end="01:10:15.330" style="s2">terms and you can they&#39;re in there in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.310" end="01:10:16.680" style="s2">the kind of the atmosphere right of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.330" end="01:10:20.400" style="s2">terms that they took but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.680" end="01:10:22.860" style="s2">background there yeah listens into the</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.400" end="01:10:27.030" style="s2">concealment and then and then tries to</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.860" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">tries to let let it show right and I was</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.030" end="01:10:31.710" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s what he okay okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:33.600" style="s2">what he means by new beginning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.710" end="01:10:37.519" style="s2">Jenny Heidegger says these things where</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.600" end="01:10:39.860" style="s2">like Ivan like um</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.519" end="01:10:42.170" style="s2">clicks it doesn&#39;t click like you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.860" end="01:10:44.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit like uh trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.170" end="01:10:47.269" style="s2">remember remember a dream play yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.570" end="01:10:49.519" style="s2">where you&#39;re like it&#39;s so clear but then</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.269" end="01:10:51.469" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna describe it and it seems so</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.519" end="01:10:53.150" style="s2">clear that it be you&#39;d think that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.469" end="01:10:56.210" style="s2">would remember it all the time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.150" end="01:10:59.739" style="s2">got this yeah beating people but you see</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.210" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">you&#39;re coming back to memory yeah huh oh</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.739" end="01:11:09.710" style="s2">yeah but but obviously you have to come</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:13.610" style="s2">back to memory because that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.710" end="01:11:15.710" style="s2">and and that that&#39;s how Debbie died and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.610" end="01:11:16.820" style="s2">others misunderstand purposefully you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.710" end="01:11:18.920" style="s2">not hiding it</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.820" end="01:11:21.019" style="s2">um because hiding it is not about</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.920" end="01:11:21.800" style="s2">destroying and a grand narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.019" end="01:11:24.289" style="s2">blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.800" end="01:11:26.690" style="s2">it&#39;s if you destroy the grand narrative</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.289" end="01:11:29.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no memory then you were just you</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.690" end="01:11:32.539" style="s2">know cutting off there is no future</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.960" end="01:11:34.489" style="s2">without origin for Heidegger the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.539" end="01:11:37.400" style="s2">beginning has always already been</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.489" end="01:11:39.260" style="s2">possible is always already there the</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.400" end="01:11:42.579" style="s2">arrival of being in all of that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.260" end="01:11:46.070" style="s2">that&#39;s just a way of again ecstatically</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.579" end="01:11:50.690" style="s2">let him go of that which is familiar but</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.070" end="01:11:53.929" style="s2">then out of that arises new if you like</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.690" end="01:11:56.030" style="s2">is everyone you horizons a torn open</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.929" end="01:11:58.130" style="s2">but those new horizons are never this</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.030" end="01:11:59.719" style="s2">kind of you know progressive idea of</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.130" end="01:12:01.999" style="s2">everything just getting better every</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.719" end="01:12:03.590" style="s2">year or or the dystopian and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.999" end="01:12:05.630" style="s2">everything&#39;s gonna get terrible no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.590" end="01:12:07.429" style="s2">it&#39;s coming out of something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.630" end="01:12:09.650" style="s2">there the other beginning you speak of</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.429" end="01:12:12.829" style="s2">an other beginning the other beginning</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.650" end="01:12:14.539" style="s2">is is related to the first beginning you</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.829" end="01:12:17.269" style="s2">can&#39;t have one without the other</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.539" end="01:12:19.639" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why he has to go through all</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.269" end="01:12:21.889" style="s2">of it again but he&#39;s not going through</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.639" end="01:12:23.900" style="s2">it and in the sense of you notice</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.889" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">describing it as Hegel would do as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.900" end="01:12:30.050" style="s2">dialectical process of and this is very</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:32.059" style="s2">very crudely put so you know all</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.050" end="01:12:34.219" style="s2">Hegelians please forgive me but that</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.059" end="01:12:36.170" style="s2">there is a thesis and antithesis and it</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.219" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">all comes together in synthesis and we</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.170" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">are marching towards freedom know</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.480" end="01:12:42.860" style="s2">there&#39;s something else at stake it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:45.860" style="s2">that hiding is this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.860" end="01:12:48.260" style="s2">strangest notes he says that the history</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.860" end="01:12:50.810" style="s2">of metaphysics or metaphysics itself but</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.260" end="01:12:54.770" style="s2">not Isis and I&#39;m not a sphere reason</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.810" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">as abstract ideas or so that&#39;s now upon</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.770" end="01:13:01.460" style="s2">us this is what we now have to face up</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:13:04.130" style="s2">to and if you think of it as for example</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.460" end="01:13:07.280" style="s2">why is it that we speak of ideas the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.130" end="01:13:08.660" style="s2">word there just means appearance the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.280" end="01:13:11.000" style="s2">Greek word idea where we get the word</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.660" end="01:13:14.600" style="s2">idea from just means appearance but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.000" end="01:13:17.750" style="s2">become over the centuries this you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.600" end="01:13:20.540" style="s2">the word idea is the the economy is</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.750" end="01:13:22.420" style="s2">driven by ideas or we live in a and idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.540" end="01:13:24.410" style="s2">economy we live in a knowledge economy</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.420" end="01:13:26.870" style="s2">everything everything is actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.410" end="01:13:29.860" style="s2">extremely abstract idea is a much more</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.870" end="01:13:33.560" style="s2">concrete than everyday worlds we live in</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.860" end="01:13:36.230" style="s2">which are legalistic and you know very</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.560" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">technical and for Heidegger to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.230" end="01:13:42.500" style="s2">understand technology and find exits</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:45.500" style="s2">from it it&#39;s a actually technology comes</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.500" end="01:13:50.840" style="s2">from a certain way that in which</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.500" end="01:13:56.060" style="s2">metaphysics has responded to that which</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.840" end="01:14:00.050" style="s2">is yes and and what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.060" end="01:14:03.340" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to in betraying to hold</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.050" end="01:14:07.390" style="s2">you can look bring this back to death</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.340" end="01:14:10.610" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to hold on to that which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.390" end="01:14:11.590" style="s2">because we devour it we desire it sorry</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.610" end="01:14:15.560" style="s2">want to devour it</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.590" end="01:14:20.090" style="s2">the will is very strong right and ask</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.560" end="01:14:23.480" style="s2">but as you know time officially at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.090" end="01:14:26.240" style="s2">is only passing it&#39;s happened as it</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.480" end="01:14:28.190" style="s2">needs to be brought back again and be</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.240" end="01:14:30.680" style="s2">brought back back again and back into</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.190" end="01:14:32.780" style="s2">presence and back into presence and how</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.680" end="01:14:36.050" style="s2">do you do that well you do that by</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.780" end="01:14:39.320" style="s2">producing hash denim denim placing</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.050" end="01:14:40.550" style="s2">positioning the ever same all the time</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.320" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">all over again</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.550" end="01:14:47.540" style="s2">yeah so how do you get to consumer goods</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:51.230" style="s2">perfectly into an exchangeable because</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.540" end="01:14:54.320" style="s2">the will wants to have full presence and</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.230" end="01:14:58.610" style="s2">control of that which is so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.320" end="01:15:00.650" style="s2">producing exchangeable goods right if</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.610" end="01:15:02.419" style="s2">they&#39;re not really good seni more</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.650" end="01:15:05.539" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing good about the but that</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.419" end="01:15:08.719" style="s2">just see she&#39;s here yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.539" end="01:15:10.399" style="s2">I mean this this is finding what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.719" end="01:15:12.590" style="s2">happening in modernity this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.399" end="01:15:18.979" style="s2">ultimately what technology is after is</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.590" end="01:15:23.749" style="s2">that it produces it must produce things</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.979" end="01:15:25.610" style="s2">at will that that are always already the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.749" end="01:15:27.530" style="s2">same as something else they&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.610" end="01:15:29.929" style="s2">there perfectly ever same turning</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.530" end="01:15:32.260" style="s2">circling around themselves right yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.929" end="01:15:32.260" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.489" end="01:15:39.919" style="s2">do you remember and they&#39;re sorry that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.260" end="01:15:42.619" style="s2">the shadows in the cave yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.919" end="01:15:45.649" style="s2">you if someone reads the cave with some</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.619" end="01:15:48.649" style="s2">you know some mental capacity and does</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.649" end="01:15:51.829" style="s2">it and it doesn&#39;t hit them right that</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.649" end="01:15:54.499" style="s2">what what&#39;s being described there is our</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.829" end="01:15:57.709" style="s2">world it&#39;s not you know some educational</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.499" end="01:16:02.869" style="s2">tool to explain the theory of forms</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.709" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s it is we are trapped in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.869" end="01:16:09.749" style="s2">cave yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:13.329" style="s2">how do we what&#39;s what&#39;s the exit yes</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.749" end="01:16:15.459" style="s2">indicate the exit isn&#39;t a leaving of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.329" end="01:16:19.090" style="s2">cave at least you always have to go back</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.459" end="01:16:21.070" style="s2">exactly yes yeah it is it&#39;s exactly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.090" end="01:16:22.780" style="s2">exactly not leaving the case right</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.070" end="01:16:25.179" style="s2">that&#39;s the strangest thing is that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.780" end="01:16:27.939" style="s2">shadows that I keep telling my students</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.179" end="01:16:30.130" style="s2">you know yours they&#39;re usually your</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.939" end="01:16:32.769" style="s2">students being duty do you teach like in</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.130" end="01:16:36.130" style="s2">a class are you like what do you got</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.769" end="01:16:37.689" style="s2">yeah yeah private students and I have I</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.130" end="01:16:39.749" style="s2">teach in the class and everything yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.689" end="01:16:44.619" style="s2">no it&#39;s a look at the shadows are real</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.749" end="01:16:46.510" style="s2">yeah right look they&#39;re not not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.619" end="01:16:48.429" style="s2">just nothing later doesn&#39;t say the</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.510" end="01:16:50.979" style="s2">shadows aren&#39;t real yeah he doesn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.429" end="01:16:53.199" style="s2">the cave isn&#39;t real sheds are real</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.979" end="01:16:56.949" style="s2">they&#39;re really there and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.199" end="01:16:59.949" style="s2">just there they&#39;re also structuring the</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.949" end="01:17:05.709" style="s2">world of the of the people in the cave</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.949" end="01:17:07.959" style="s2">of the prisoners yeah so and get that so</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.709" end="01:17:10.929" style="s2">a couple things there&#39;s one experience I</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.959" end="01:17:15.189" style="s2">had with you where what did by the way</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.929" end="01:17:17.229" style="s2">the thing that when you said ah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.189" end="01:17:20.709" style="s2">using memory again and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.229" end="01:17:23.469" style="s2">muffin what like it that whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.709" end="01:17:26.729" style="s2">feeling is I had of like oh yeah was</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.469" end="01:17:32.249" style="s2">just using memory there that except that</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.729" end="01:17:32.249" style="s2">experience that&#39;s that is that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.340" end="01:17:38.590" style="s2">what we call circling is etching that</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.099" end="01:17:42.130" style="s2">fat like part of getting someone&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.590" end="01:17:43.809" style="s2">is catching that background but but</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.130" end="01:17:45.510" style="s2">because background for me and you called</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.809" end="01:17:48.489" style="s2">it out there&#39;s that moment of like</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.510" end="01:17:51.249" style="s2">ecstatic kind of doom to do to engine</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.489" end="01:17:54.400" style="s2">jet totally the same after that you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.249" end="01:17:59.019" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering if in a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.400" end="01:18:02.639" style="s2">like for me the memory was like the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.019" end="01:18:07.329" style="s2">shadow in the cave and then you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.639" end="01:18:10.269" style="s2">shined you brought me into the light and</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.329" end="01:18:12.849" style="s2">then and then when I saw it I was back</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.269" end="01:18:14.979" style="s2">like shadow with the print is that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.849" end="01:18:17.110" style="s2">that a good well that&#39;s that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.979" end="01:18:19.300" style="s2">Heidegger says you know you you have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.110" end="01:18:19.540" style="s2">leave the cave yeah because only when</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.300" end="01:18:21.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.540" end="01:18:23.620" style="s2">left the cave you can see the shadows as</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.640" end="01:18:27.070" style="s2">shadows that they don&#39;t light up as</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.620" end="01:18:29.620" style="s2">shadows before yeah so bye-bye always</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.070" end="01:18:32.530" style="s2">being in that you know continuous</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.620" end="01:18:34.840" style="s2">struggle and strife between that which</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.530" end="01:18:37.300" style="s2">is down there that which is out there</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.840" end="01:18:40.330" style="s2">and coming back down into it then</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.300" end="01:18:42.970" style="s2">there&#39;s and I this is why you know that</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.330" end="01:18:45.880" style="s2">this conversation is as any good</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.970" end="01:18:47.830" style="s2">conversation it is a continuum would you</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.880" end="01:18:51.010" style="s2">call us Reckling which is a hermeneutic</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.830" end="01:18:54.100" style="s2">circle which is almost like a spiral but</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.010" end="01:18:55.830" style="s2">it&#39;s yes statically working through us</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.100" end="01:19:00.040" style="s2">and then bringing something back that</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.830" end="01:19:03.370" style="s2">that that&#39;s that then because you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.040" end="01:19:03.880" style="s2">if you are on a time line then it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.370" end="01:19:06.280" style="s2">the past</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.880" end="01:19:08.860" style="s2">anyways we&#39;re in ideaa an hour ago you</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.280" end="01:19:12.280" style="s2">said this but it&#39;s actually it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.860" end="01:19:14.980" style="s2">it&#39;s if there&#39;s anything to expand</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.280" end="01:19:18.330" style="s2">equality in non you know theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.980" end="01:19:21.310" style="s2">terms it&#39;s been working it&#39;s at that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.330" end="01:19:23.350" style="s2">mentioning of memory at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.310" end="01:19:28.270" style="s2">this conversation it had to begin</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.350" end="01:19:29.950" style="s2">somewhere work itself through what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.270" end="01:19:32.790" style="s2">talking about so because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.950" end="01:19:35.070" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re always memorizing</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.790" end="01:19:37.660" style="s2">memorizing so we can be memory</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.070" end="01:19:40.330" style="s2">remembering we are remembering what</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.660" end="01:19:43.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about and making leaves to</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.330" end="01:19:46.270" style="s2">the next topic or feel or ground that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.930" end="01:19:47.860" style="s2">occurring and showing itself and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.270" end="01:19:50.440" style="s2">trying to make sense of what&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.860" end="01:19:52.900" style="s2">shown itself to us and that sense but</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.440" end="01:19:56.290" style="s2">with that that only works by by real</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.900" end="01:19:58.450" style="s2">like genuine memory which isn&#39;t which</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.290" end="01:20:00.310" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly what how we think of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.450" end="01:20:03.220" style="s2">now which is you know storing data</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.310" end="01:20:06.940" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re information on some on some</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.220" end="01:20:10.000" style="s2">computer or a cloud or whatever it stays</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.940" end="01:20:14.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually it&#39;s working itself</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.000" end="01:20:18.070" style="s2">through us and through the medium of</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.920" end="01:20:19.660" style="s2">language and and this is also why we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.070" end="01:20:24.150" style="s2">we&#39;ve given example you&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.660" end="01:20:26.710" style="s2">examples off of your childhood the</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.150" end="01:20:29.110" style="s2">suburbs and I&#39;ve talked about where I</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.710" end="01:20:31.720" style="s2">come from I&#39;ve talked about my</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.110" end="01:20:32.870" style="s2">experience in in the US but look these</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.720" end="01:20:35.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t just data</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.870" end="01:20:38.120" style="s2">points right these are not like oh look</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.600" end="01:20:40.340" style="s2">here&#39;s a here&#39;s a piece of data that can</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.120" end="01:20:42.680" style="s2">just throw this it&#39;s like if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.340" end="01:20:45.140" style="s2">data&#39;s just a given Asst then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.680" end="01:20:47.030" style="s2">meaningless yeah it needs to be it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.140" end="01:20:49.910" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the data just literally</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.030" end="01:20:52.970" style="s2">literally just means given right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.910" end="01:20:55.370" style="s2">data battle but it isn&#39;t it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.970" end="01:20:58.820" style="s2">not given it needs to be rested from</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.370" end="01:21:01.010" style="s2">some some place and then being brought</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.820" end="01:21:03.590" style="s2">back to light and then you have a proper</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.010" end="01:21:05.720" style="s2">conversation or dialogue or something</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.590" end="01:21:08.450" style="s2">lights up that then maybe even you</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.720" end="01:21:14.570" style="s2">didn&#39;t see yourself before right right</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.450" end="01:21:18.710" style="s2">exactly exactly at lining up</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.570" end="01:21:21.230" style="s2">is it there&#39;s this there&#39;s a I think in</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.710" end="01:21:24.679" style="s2">taco not being in time but time and</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.230" end="01:21:29.989" style="s2">being like is a later work yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.679" end="01:21:32.210" style="s2">inning where he talks about I I read</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.989" end="01:21:34.219" style="s2">this a lot it&#39;s in the beginning of some</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.210" end="01:21:36.590" style="s2">of the courses that I do where he talks</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.219" end="01:21:38.840" style="s2">about like perhaps it&#39;s a good idea if</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.590" end="01:21:41.329" style="s2">we not like demand immediate</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.840" end="01:21:44.449" style="s2">intelligibility and he says it about you</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.329" end="01:21:47.920" style="s2">know yep the artist and then the poet</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.449" end="01:21:51.380" style="s2">and then like Heisenberg&#39;s formula and</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.920" end="01:21:53.719" style="s2">then he says something about like you</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.380" end="01:21:59.809" style="s2">know and perhaps it&#39;d be a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.719" end="01:22:03.380" style="s2">well he says like this he says I think</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.809" end="01:22:05.510" style="s2">it&#39;s this one like sentence and I have</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.380" end="01:22:09.889" style="s2">been thinking about for 20 years</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.510" end="01:22:12.469" style="s2">literally and I I don&#39;t it like a it</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.889" end="01:22:14.059" style="s2">eludes my grasp but if it keeps calling</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.469" end="01:22:15.650" style="s2">to me right and I still don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.059" end="01:22:18.050" style="s2">understand it but I think I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.650" end="01:22:20.599" style="s2">little hint of it as we&#39;re talking where</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.050" end="01:22:24.050" style="s2">he says let me give you a hint on how to</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.599" end="01:22:26.389" style="s2">listen right and for first of all just</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.050" end="01:22:28.789" style="s2">that part right which is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.389" end="01:22:31.130" style="s2">not just listening there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.789" end="01:22:33.710" style="s2">listen right yeah yeah exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.130" end="01:22:37.880" style="s2">no because is interesting right because</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.710" end="01:22:42.710" style="s2">ears aren&#39;t just on take you know tools</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.880" end="01:22:46.099" style="s2">to accept and receive sound waves yes</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.710" end="01:22:48.530" style="s2">but this is how we think of them on</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.099" end="01:22:50.360" style="s2">Tisha I have a friend from Vienna mo</p>

<p begin="01:22:56.179" end="01:23:03.440" style="s2">hearing their ways of listening yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.869" end="01:23:06.760" style="s2">there are ways of seeing and and you</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.440" end="01:23:08.900" style="s2">know it&#39;s always disliked being eclectic</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.760" end="01:23:12.489" style="s2">multi-dimensional if you like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.900" end="01:23:17.829" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean that kind of that that</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.730" end="01:23:29.570" style="s2">lecture yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.949" end="01:23:33.050" style="s2">exactly what is something like um</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.570" end="01:23:38.480" style="s2">instead of listening the lecture of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.050" end="01:23:41.620" style="s2">series of propositions yes dad we can</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.480" end="01:23:46.219" style="s2">begin to follow the movement of showing</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.620" end="01:23:48.830" style="s2">yeah to follow the movement of showing</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.219" end="01:23:52.250" style="s2">if we refrain and how I how I understand</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.830" end="01:23:55.010" style="s2">that is it&#39;s like so to listen to you in</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.250" end="01:23:58.130" style="s2">a suit like it to translate you or to</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.010" end="01:23:59.810" style="s2">hear you with the series as a series of</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.130" end="01:24:02.810" style="s2">is is you delivering a series of</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.810" end="01:24:06.500" style="s2">propositions on some level I already</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.810" end="01:24:09.380" style="s2">have to have the proposition right to</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.500" end="01:24:12.500" style="s2">then line it up or not line it up like</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.380" end="01:24:15.469" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of quality of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.500" end="01:24:17.810" style="s2">a box of intelligibility that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.469" end="01:24:20.600" style="s2">maintain and I can either agree or</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.810" end="01:24:22.520" style="s2">disagree yeah well I think what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.600" end="01:24:24.949" style="s2">saying is what I&#39;m hearing is like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.520" end="01:24:28.010" style="s2">if there&#39;s first of all this is not easy</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.949" end="01:24:31.640" style="s2">but if you can basically refrain from</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.010" end="01:24:34.670" style="s2">that right something else begins to show</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.640" end="01:24:36.320" style="s2">itself right and here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.670" end="01:24:38.300" style="s2">this is what I think I want to like</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.320" end="01:24:41.179" style="s2">understand because I&#39;m summable I feel</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.300" end="01:24:42.500" style="s2">like this is what I&#39;ve been the only</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.179" end="01:24:44.690" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve been interested in but I</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.500" end="01:24:47.719" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it totally it will get</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.690" end="01:24:53.150" style="s2">a little it eludes my grasp follow the</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.719" end="01:24:57.100" style="s2">movement of showing like what do you</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.150" end="01:24:59.780" style="s2">I just curious what are you hearing that</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.100" end="01:25:02.420" style="s2">then some level this conversation feels</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.780" end="01:25:06.050" style="s2">like things are showing themselves right</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.420" end="01:25:08.060" style="s2">and it does well it were yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.050" end="01:25:09.620" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right you&#39;re exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.060" end="01:25:11.210" style="s2">what you presents before there was that</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.620" end="01:25:14.110" style="s2">sense of if you even said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.210" end="01:25:18.650" style="s2">interesting you did it in in explaining</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.110" end="01:25:21.650" style="s2">it right that&#39;s right what I read it</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.650" end="01:25:24.650" style="s2">back and remembering this and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.650" end="01:25:28.640" style="s2">remembering that I said remembering it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.650" end="01:25:31.699" style="s2">like this these lingering things that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.640" end="01:25:34.790" style="s2">then kind of bit then something opens up</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.699" end="01:25:36.679" style="s2">it shows this I&#39;m like oh that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.790" end="01:25:38.830" style="s2">and then you pour more wine and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.679" end="01:25:38.830" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.800" end="01:25:45.130" style="s2">imagine are we doing that right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.269" end="01:25:47.920" style="s2">just they were doing it but but look</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.130" end="01:25:55.329" style="s2">this this is imagined the hell I live in</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.920" end="01:25:59.289" style="s2">okay but uh it&#39;s it&#39;s I think just it is</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.329" end="01:26:05.610" style="s2">ecstatic in that sense that it it takes</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.289" end="01:26:11.079" style="s2">you out off what is ordinarily there and</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.610" end="01:26:13.539" style="s2">into that that which properly is and</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.079" end="01:26:16.210" style="s2">when hiding assesses in time and being I</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.539" end="01:26:18.820" style="s2">mean he just isn&#39;t in most of his public</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.210" end="01:26:24.789" style="s2">talks are you could think of for example</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.820" end="01:26:29.019" style="s2">the the technology si but the question</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.789" end="01:26:31.719" style="s2">for technology where he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.019" end="01:26:33.760" style="s2">repetitive to yeah he&#39;s very repetitive</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.719" end="01:26:36.400" style="s2">but he&#39;s always coming at it from a</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.760" end="01:26:38.619" style="s2">different angle and then bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.400" end="01:26:44.739" style="s2">back out again and it isn&#39;t so much</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.619" end="01:26:48.880" style="s2">about a propositional there are no</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.739" end="01:26:50.409" style="s2">claims there are no arguments if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.880" end="01:26:54.730" style="s2">like you right</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.409" end="01:26:57.880" style="s2">I mean hiding has a a short note that it</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.730" end="01:26:59.769" style="s2">will not be published that was sent out</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.880" end="01:27:03.519" style="s2">from the Heidegger Society a couple</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.769" end="01:27:06.309" style="s2">years ago on algo mental and I think he</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.519" end="01:27:08.710" style="s2">understands argument in in a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.309" end="01:27:12.940" style="s2">lighting up of lighting something up of</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.710" end="01:27:16.750" style="s2">showing um and so what what he does I</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.940" end="01:27:19.179" style="s2">think you cannot formalize it so I can</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.750" end="01:27:23.079" style="s2">only give you another hint at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.179" end="01:27:28.179" style="s2">happening it&#39;s that Heidegger is I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.079" end="01:27:31.800" style="s2">very aware of of what&#39;s going on of</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.179" end="01:27:35.320" style="s2">where it might be coming from of</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.800" end="01:27:39.579" style="s2">concealments in history and if you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.320" end="01:27:42.030" style="s2">aware of concealments you are in and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.579" end="01:27:45.369" style="s2">sometimes have to stop myself you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.030" end="01:27:47.619" style="s2">because then you see well this sounds</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.369" end="01:27:49.580" style="s2">almost like a cliche but you you see</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.619" end="01:27:53.310" style="s2">where others wouldn&#39;t even look</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.580" end="01:27:55.650" style="s2">but in its a and it isn&#39;t as because I</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.310" end="01:27:58.230" style="s2">said before there is this good presence</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.650" end="01:28:02.010" style="s2">that comes about from ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.230" end="01:28:04.290" style="s2">temporality that then you can enter by</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.010" end="01:28:09.240" style="s2">reading and rereading these texts for</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.290" end="01:28:12.750" style="s2">example so that the this showing is</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.240" end="01:28:15.080" style="s2">exactly you know it&#39;s it&#39;s bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.750" end="01:28:21.180" style="s2">back out what&#39;s there anyways</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.080" end="01:28:22.920" style="s2">but hidden this is why I&#39;m you can think</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.180" end="01:28:24.650" style="s2">of it as and this is not my idea this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.920" end="01:28:28.950" style="s2">my supervisor let me get the statement</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.650" end="01:28:32.310" style="s2">was written you know in in in spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.950" end="01:28:34.800" style="s2">Heidegger a book on aesthetics where he</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.310" end="01:28:37.260" style="s2">says that metaphor is misunderstood by</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:39.750" style="s2">us in the West we think of metaphors you</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.260" end="01:28:42.360" style="s2">know just just an image did you give to</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.750" end="01:28:44.640" style="s2">illustrate something yeah yeah Lisa&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.360" end="01:28:47.670" style="s2">metaphor I&#39;m the Greek literally just</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.640" end="01:28:50.550" style="s2">means to to bring some metaphor rain I</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.670" end="01:28:56.070" style="s2">think means to bring to bring something</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.550" end="01:29:01.020" style="s2">out and about and up which is there but</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.070" end="01:29:04.470" style="s2">hidden covered over absconding absent</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.020" end="01:29:06.240" style="s2">right but and this is what Heidi</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.470" end="01:29:08.490" style="s2">goodness but he sees and this is why you</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.240" end="01:29:10.230" style="s2">know I said in the beginning also that</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.490" end="01:29:14.940" style="s2">what Heidegger I think is always doing</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.230" end="01:29:18.360" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to liberate or not liberate</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.940" end="01:29:20.760" style="s2">but show access from the Cartesian</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.360" end="01:29:22.530" style="s2">matrix that which is that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.760" end="01:29:24.270" style="s2">subject object that caught to me where</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.530" end="01:29:28.110" style="s2">we are divided from the world and from</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.270" end="01:29:30.120" style="s2">not explain to show no because look if</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.110" end="01:29:32.100" style="s2">you explain then you are literally I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.120" end="01:29:35.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s a short story by Ian</p>

<p begin="01:30:26.380" end="01:30:30.100" style="s2">know the best is strange that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.420" end="01:30:33.670" style="s2">strange thing about abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.100" end="01:30:35.920" style="s2">rationality is that it can trap you and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.670" end="01:30:37.480" style="s2">you have it you know you got it all</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.920" end="01:30:40.300" style="s2">figured out intellectually but it</p>

<p begin="01:31:18.340" end="01:31:28.300" style="s2">that should be possible it is actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.620" end="01:31:31.420" style="s2">for him an experience that that that if</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.300" end="01:31:33.760" style="s2">you listen and then let it be like let</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.420" end="01:31:36.190" style="s2">something be shown to you not from him</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.760" end="01:31:37.690" style="s2">as an authority figure but something</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.190" end="01:31:40.660" style="s2">that&#39;s phenomenology right something</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.690" end="01:31:47.190" style="s2">that shows itself from itself as but all</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.660" end="01:31:48.580" style="s2">she needs or what does or is then then</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.190" end="01:31:51.550" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.580" end="01:31:54.340" style="s2">lights out were shows itself that to a</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.550" end="01:31:56.650" style="s2">certain degree was there but not not</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.340" end="01:32:00.100" style="s2">given but was there in the sense that in</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.650" end="01:32:01.900" style="s2">the moment of of it lighting up it</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.100" end="01:32:05.340" style="s2">becomes it&#39;s it&#39;s really there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.900" end="01:32:08.440" style="s2">really present and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.340" end="01:32:11.920" style="s2">possible and also in the sense of in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.440" end="01:32:13.540" style="s2">tremana means moved moogly that means</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.920" end="01:32:15.660" style="s2">and that comes for Heidegger at least</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.540" end="01:32:17.490" style="s2">understands it as coming from Moo</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.660" end="01:32:21.540" style="s2">which means to like to love so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.490" end="01:32:24.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a new new way opening up for for</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.540" end="01:32:26.250" style="s2">loving a certain way of being that it</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.510" end="01:32:28.710" style="s2">wasn&#39;t there before so if you just</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.250" end="01:32:31.820" style="s2">engaged in it intellectually or you know</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.710" end="01:32:33.800" style="s2">in that sense how we think of it as</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.820" end="01:32:36.780" style="s2">philosophy has become institutionalized</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.800" end="01:32:40.100" style="s2">everything&#39;s become institutionalized um</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.780" end="01:32:42.060" style="s2">then you&#39;re just trapped again and in</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.100" end="01:32:46.170" style="s2">because so much of thinking now is</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.060" end="01:32:48.840" style="s2">thinking is schemas and representations</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.170" end="01:32:51.180" style="s2">and associations you know you know this</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.840" end="01:32:54.480" style="s2">reminds me of innocence good like that</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.180" end="01:32:56.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s going nowhere right you you</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.480" end="01:33:00.150" style="s2">mentioned the word autism before I mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.220" end="01:33:02.910" style="s2">it is a literal autism huh yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.150" end="01:33:05.550" style="s2">mean or or to speak in the Greek sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.910" end="01:33:09.180" style="s2">it&#39;s idiocy here&#39;s the idiot</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.550" end="01:33:11.580" style="s2">that&#39;s idiot or why it means someone</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.180" end="01:33:15.210" style="s2">just for himself circling around himself</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.580" end="01:33:17.040" style="s2">yeah but but not but but precisely not</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.210" end="01:33:20.820" style="s2">coming out into the world this is where</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.040" end="01:33:22.920" style="s2">you yes this is what we have to do you</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.820" end="01:33:29.900" style="s2">know it&#39;s interesting because I I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.920" end="01:33:33.750" style="s2">this is what I&#39;m it seems it seems that</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.900" end="01:33:37.500" style="s2">it seems to me that I get it when when I</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.750" end="01:33:40.260" style="s2">can see it like in it there&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.500" end="01:33:42.330" style="s2">you&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been spend is my hands</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.260" end="01:33:44.130" style="s2">that you really use your hands so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.330" end="01:33:47.520" style="s2">like here it&#39;s like you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.130" end="01:33:49.950" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s not in your head</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.520" end="01:33:54.330" style="s2">you&#39;re I could feel as I&#39;m listening to</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.950" end="01:33:56.370" style="s2">you I can feel my my sense of embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.330" end="01:33:59.010" style="s2">and my guess like there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.370" end="01:34:01.410" style="s2">leaning forward and I just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.010" end="01:34:05.070" style="s2">something going on in the body and a</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.410" end="01:34:09.000" style="s2">very visceral right yeah what I think is</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.070" end="01:34:10.950" style="s2">so exciting for me or ecstatic is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.000" end="01:34:14.280" style="s2">and this is why I have a question about</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.950" end="01:34:18.480" style="s2">this about yeah Alethea right</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.280" end="01:34:20.700" style="s2">Alethea so I always thought that like</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.480" end="01:34:23.120" style="s2">Alethea when I first started reading</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.700" end="01:34:26.100" style="s2">Heidegger I thought ilithyia was the</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.120" end="01:34:29.099" style="s2">like is the event of on concealment</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.100" end="01:34:32.190" style="s2">right yeah and I thought that it was a</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.099" end="01:34:34.710" style="s2">what was the the what was unconcealed</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.190" end="01:34:37.860" style="s2">what was lit up yeah I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.710" end="01:34:41.250" style="s2">about it like my if I look at my</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.860" end="01:34:45.320" style="s2">experience of it it&#39;s actually I I it</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.250" end="01:34:51.420" style="s2">seems to be less about what was revealed</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.320" end="01:34:54.079" style="s2">but in some way more about I don&#39;t mores</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.420" end="01:34:58.590" style="s2">the right way um but more about</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.079" end="01:35:01.409" style="s2">concealed miss was revealed like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.590" end="01:35:03.030" style="s2">like yeah like a good example of this is</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.409" end="01:35:06.570" style="s2">like if you watch the movie The Sixth</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.030" end="01:35:08.219" style="s2">Sense right where you know it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.570" end="01:35:09.659" style="s2">movie of it is Bruce Willis and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.219" end="01:35:11.639" style="s2">dead the whole time but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.659" end="01:35:13.619" style="s2">it&#39;s alright the end neither does he and</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.639" end="01:35:15.420" style="s2">of course you know when I went to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.619" end="01:35:16.619" style="s2">movie my ex my ex-wife knew it she</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.420" end="01:35:18.510" style="s2">always knows that stuff but like</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.619" end="01:35:21.449" style="s2">everybody else in the theater including</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.510" end="01:35:23.790" style="s2">me didn&#39;t know it and he&#39;s dead and you</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.449" end="01:35:27.810" style="s2">at first the movies odd but then the odd</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.790" end="01:35:29.579" style="s2">disappears right like and then and then</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.810" end="01:35:32.099" style="s2">as the movie unfolds right at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.579" end="01:35:34.980" style="s2">the movie he doesn&#39;t realize he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.099" end="01:35:36.630" style="s2">right like yeah you don&#39;t realize he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.980" end="01:35:39.449" style="s2">dead and then just out of the corner of</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.630" end="01:35:41.159" style="s2">his eye something all of a sudden he</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.449" end="01:35:42.619" style="s2">recognizes it and you had this sight</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.159" end="01:35:45.570" style="s2">like everybody in theaters</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.619" end="01:35:48.630" style="s2">simultaneously recognizing oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.570" end="01:35:50.610" style="s2">he&#39;s dead he&#39;s and you get this</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.630" end="01:35:53.429" style="s2">experience of he&#39;s dead so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.610" end="01:35:55.380" style="s2">revealed but oh god here here comes the</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.429" end="01:35:58.860" style="s2">memory part but then what happens is the</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.380" end="01:36:01.560" style="s2">moment he realizes as he&#39;s dead everyone</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.860" end="01:36:05.040" style="s2">else does it goes back to the very</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.560" end="01:36:08.489" style="s2">beginning of the movie and it shows core</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.040" end="01:36:11.070" style="s2">frames in it and you see he was it was</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.489" end="01:36:14.909" style="s2">obvious the little time but the mood</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.070" end="01:36:17.099" style="s2">right the mood that was a vote it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.909" end="01:36:19.260" style="s2">it couldn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.099" end="01:36:21.239" style="s2">reduced to that like oh I didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.260" end="01:36:22.800" style="s2">he was dead and now I see he&#39;s dead and</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.239" end="01:36:25.409" style="s2">now I can see that he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.800" end="01:36:28.670" style="s2">no what you actually see is that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.409" end="01:36:34.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t see it right and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.670" end="01:36:36.480" style="s2">ecstatic I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.679" end="01:36:38.130" style="s2">quite quite how to put it but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.480" end="01:36:39.809" style="s2">always I&#39;ve noticed because like a lot</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.130" end="01:36:41.969" style="s2">of times like in my work and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.809" end="01:36:42.430" style="s2">that there&#39;s those moments of where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.969" end="01:36:47.620" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.430" end="01:36:51.850" style="s2">people it&#39;s not people it&#39;s not funny</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.620" end="01:36:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s these these these deep</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.850" end="01:36:58.240" style="s2">experiences that people have of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.680" end="01:37:02.260" style="s2">whoa like seeing everything the content</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.240" end="01:37:03.850" style="s2">of what seemed seems like in fact in</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.260" end="01:37:07.030" style="s2">fact oftentimes the content of what</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.850" end="01:37:10.390" style="s2">seems content like the cook is usually</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.030" end="01:37:12.280" style="s2">awful it&#39;s like oh my god I&#39;ve like turn</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.390" end="01:37:13.900" style="s2">the whole world into my mother and been</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.280" end="01:37:15.040" style="s2">trying to save her he&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.900" end="01:37:18.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not good news</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.040" end="01:37:23.020" style="s2">but yeah healing is one of like almost</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.160" end="01:37:25.300" style="s2">like a like an ecstatic like a hot like</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.020" end="01:37:28.000" style="s2">an ecstatic countenance of some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.300" end="01:37:30.190" style="s2">like a and I&#39;ve been thinking about that</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.000" end="01:37:33.070" style="s2">was like I I&#39;m wondering about is is</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.190" end="01:37:38.110" style="s2">that what Heidegger means right when he</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.070" end="01:37:40.630" style="s2">means the event of truth right like that</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.110" end="01:37:42.220" style="s2">that the the thing about concealment</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.630" end="01:37:44.170" style="s2">like it just feels like it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.220" end="01:37:49.420" style="s2">more about concealment and that</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.170" end="01:37:52.570" style="s2">precisely maybe post modernity it like</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.420" end="01:37:54.340" style="s2">was like just to completely forgot about</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.570" end="01:37:58.000" style="s2">the concealment on some level they made</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.340" end="01:38:03.130" style="s2">it in a project right and then and it</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.000" end="01:38:05.800" style="s2">became all about the revealed right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.130" end="01:38:10.780" style="s2">no sense of the mystery of it or the</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.800" end="01:38:13.810" style="s2">mood of yeah there to show itself to us</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.780" end="01:38:18.100" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s there hidden and we can</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.810" end="01:38:19.990" style="s2">be aware of that hiddenness is and had</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.100" end="01:38:25.150" style="s2">that guide us it might am I making sense</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.990" end="01:38:27.010" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah no I did this is to bring</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.150" end="01:38:32.740" style="s2">this back to when we talked about for</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.010" end="01:38:35.910" style="s2">example technology and it&#39;s I mean just</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.740" end="01:38:38.680" style="s2">just I forgot the name of the the</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.910" end="01:38:40.840" style="s2">director of the sick of the sixth sense</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.680" end="01:38:41.710" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s a Bruce Willis is that I</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.840" end="01:38:43.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:38:43.600" end="01:38:48.180" style="s2">the director made a lot of movies that</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.250" end="01:38:51.160" style="s2">are quite a few movies that are you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.180" end="01:38:52.720" style="s2">playing with what&#39;s there and what&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:38:55.870" end="01:39:01.860" style="s2">and it also shows you that film is in</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.450" end="01:39:11.650" style="s2">hiding google disagree is an ecstatic</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.860" end="01:39:16.050" style="s2">art form yes but what over behind a gap</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.650" end="01:39:18.610" style="s2">what&#39;s always already been forgotten is</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.050" end="01:39:22.510" style="s2">Fabio and concealment but also the</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.610" end="01:39:24.520" style="s2">absconded of being and in the epoch of</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.510" end="01:39:27.520" style="s2">technology and this is so this is not</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.520" end="01:39:29.950" style="s2">just a pure model problem for him this</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.520" end="01:39:33.160" style="s2">is also problem of or something that</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.950" end="01:39:36.310" style="s2">that we inherit from Greek what Greek</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.160" end="01:39:41.200" style="s2">thinking and so we stick with the</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.310" end="01:39:45.550" style="s2">present as that which is perfectly given</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.200" end="01:39:48.280" style="s2">and this plays out in in the sciences</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.550" end="01:39:52.810" style="s2">are in the Natural Sciences especially</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.280" end="01:39:55.570" style="s2">as you know you find something you have</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.810" end="01:39:58.300" style="s2">you have a certain data set and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.570" end="01:39:59.920" style="s2">it that&#39;s nature we find we found the</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.300" end="01:40:02.440" style="s2">gene I mean they&#39;ve moved the strange</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.920" end="01:40:04.600" style="s2">thing is also though that the scientists</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.440" end="01:40:07.030" style="s2">keep moving away from their own findings</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.600" end="01:40:10.600" style="s2">right once they found something this is</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.030" end="01:40:12.520" style="s2">it we this is the human genome that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.600" end="01:40:15.250" style="s2">but they&#39;re kind of moving away from the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.520" end="01:40:17.140" style="s2">gene theory now yeah that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.250" end="01:40:18.880" style="s2">like movie Auto we can&#39;t really find the</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.140" end="01:40:23.380" style="s2">the gene that makes you stupid because</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.880" end="01:40:25.780" style="s2">there isn&#39;t yes so it&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.380" end="01:40:28.660" style="s2">somewhere else i mean i you know unleash</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.780" end="01:40:30.400" style="s2">it this is just very maybe not a good</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.660" end="01:40:33.040" style="s2">example but nietzsche was supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.400" end="01:40:35.350" style="s2">have had syphilis and that&#39;s why he</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.040" end="01:40:37.450" style="s2">collapsed right and now they found</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.350" end="01:40:39.150" style="s2">something else is the reason and i said</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.450" end="01:40:42.550" style="s2">to someone who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.150" end="01:40:43.810" style="s2">Anitra scala i said same zone ten twenty</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.550" end="01:40:46.240" style="s2">years ago thirty years ago everyone</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.810" end="01:40:49.750" style="s2">believed it was syphilis that got him</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.240" end="01:40:52.480" style="s2">that made him collapse and Torino back</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.750" end="01:40:53.740" style="s2">then and and I said now it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.480" end="01:40:55.390" style="s2">else right and it sounds something in</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.740" end="01:40:57.340" style="s2">his brain or whatever and he said yes</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.390" end="01:40:59.350" style="s2">this is where science stands down I said</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.340" end="01:41:01.630" style="s2">stem so what are you gonna say to me in</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.350" end="01:41:03.370" style="s2">ten years time when they think you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.630" end="01:41:05.020" style="s2">when they find out it was something else</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.370" end="01:41:07.420" style="s2">and he said you know this is just how</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.020" end="01:41:09.369" style="s2">science has moved on and found something</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.420" end="01:41:10.899" style="s2">new so this is literally how you know</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.369" end="01:41:13.090" style="s2">it&#39;s just always finding something new</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.899" end="01:41:15.309" style="s2">than you oh we found something you were</p>
<p begin="01:41:13.090" end="01:41:17.320" style="s2">it&#39;s completely and forgetting that</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.309" end="01:41:19.840" style="s2">which has been concealed by that new</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.320" end="01:41:22.119" style="s2">finding it&#39;s just programmed into the</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.840" end="01:41:24.489" style="s2">entire story right right</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.119" end="01:41:26.559" style="s2">so what hiding is as in the let&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.489" end="01:41:29.379" style="s2">humanism for example is he said it might</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.559" end="01:41:34.479" style="s2">just be that nature does not show</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.379" end="01:41:40.419" style="s2">herself to the modern or our machines or</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.479" end="01:41:43.479" style="s2">apparent Paris to our tools have used in</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.419" end="01:41:46.030" style="s2">order to to bring out the wrists the</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.479" end="01:41:48.159" style="s2">results of design from from nature and</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.030" end="01:41:50.619" style="s2">to a certain degree you know we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.159" end="01:41:53.820" style="s2">transcendental idealists or all contents</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.619" end="01:41:57.849" style="s2">because we find something that we hip</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.820" end="01:41:59.379" style="s2">hypothesize yes but it&#39;s it&#39;s not just I</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.849" end="01:42:02.769" style="s2">mean when it comes a thing of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.379" end="01:42:08.439" style="s2">also mind-blowing least range the epoch</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.769" end="01:42:10.539" style="s2">we live in imagine there are Greek</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.439" end="01:42:11.889" style="s2">thinkers thousands of years ago will</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.539" end="01:42:16.179" style="s2">talk about the optimist</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.889" end="01:42:18.070" style="s2">I&#39;m the indivisible particle and then we</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.179" end="01:42:21.090" style="s2">go about all just let&#39;s just split the</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.070" end="01:42:23.590" style="s2">atom and set free vast amounts of energy</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.090" end="01:42:26.349" style="s2">were there there&#39;s a gentleman called</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.590" end="01:42:31.539" style="s2">Hicks who who was at my alma mater at</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.349" end="01:42:34.929" style="s2">King&#39;s College London who dreamt up the</p>

<p begin="01:42:34.929" end="01:42:41.409" style="s2">the mountains of Switzerland in the</p>

<p begin="01:42:41.409" end="01:42:46.840" style="s2">honest I mean hint it and what might be</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.229" end="01:42:48.610" style="s2">happening yeah and you know what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.840" end="01:42:51.909" style="s2">described about concealment is that</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.610" end="01:42:54.669" style="s2">concealment is forgotten but but but but</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.909" end="01:42:56.499" style="s2">forgetting is forgotten as well so</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.669" end="01:42:58.719" style="s2">they&#39;re always double concealments</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.499" end="01:43:00.550" style="s2">happening this is why I gave this you</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.719" end="01:43:02.499" style="s2">know strange example of Nietzsche and</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.550" end="01:43:04.840" style="s2">Nietzsche is a beautiful example here</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.499" end="01:43:06.489" style="s2">because you know first it syphilis now</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.840" end="01:43:08.139" style="s2">it&#39;s a brain tumor and ten years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.489" end="01:43:10.510" style="s2">something else but then we&#39;ll be fine</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.139" end="01:43:12.039" style="s2">because we&#39;ve moved on so we can forget</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.510" end="01:43:15.309" style="s2">about what we didn&#39;t understand their</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.039" end="01:43:17.999" style="s2">first place and the simplest truth about</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.309" end="01:43:21.070" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s collapse would just be to</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.999" end="01:43:23.170" style="s2">exact and that&#39;s unbearable for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.070" end="01:43:26.410" style="s2">modern subject but to accept that needs</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.170" end="01:43:29.820" style="s2">collapses why because it you collapse is</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.410" end="01:43:33.040" style="s2">because of thinking he collapses because</p>

<p begin="01:43:33.040" end="01:43:38.469" style="s2">that&#39;s worked itself through and in</p>

<p begin="01:43:38.469" end="01:43:44.710" style="s2">like of metaphysics broke out within him</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.469" end="01:43:46.719" style="s2">that&#39;s why he collapses he doesn&#39;t yes</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.710" end="01:43:49.360" style="s2">he Colette the cause you could say is</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.719" end="01:43:51.850" style="s2">that a horse is being beat but then he</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.360" end="01:43:55.840" style="s2">he didn&#39;t come back to life for eleven</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.850" end="01:43:57.580" style="s2">years and then he died in in he was you</p>

<p begin="01:43:57.580" end="01:44:01.570" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.989" end="01:44:03.610" style="s2">he many read his notes at the end of it</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.570" end="01:44:06.370" style="s2">he was just in a frenzy because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.610" end="01:44:11.199" style="s2">also the seismograph of modernity he</p>

<p begin="01:44:11.199" end="01:44:15.880" style="s2">that that to say that makes you it is</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.870" end="01:44:18.190" style="s2">officially something that&#39;s considered</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.880" end="01:44:21.790" style="s2">madness right if I say that then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.190" end="01:44:23.850" style="s2">considered idiotic and mad and someone</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.790" end="01:44:27.730" style="s2">who you kind of possibly mean that</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.850" end="01:44:29.920" style="s2">because we we know it was syphilis no it</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.730" end="01:44:32.080" style="s2">was the brain tumor but what&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.920" end="01:44:33.820" style="s2">through all of this is trying to reveal</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.080" end="01:44:35.920" style="s2">something is that this is really it look</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.820" end="01:44:38.710" style="s2">we can we can latch onto this we can</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.920" end="01:44:42.880" style="s2">grasp it we can categorize we can define</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.710" end="01:44:46.570" style="s2">and we can we can have it in our hands</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.880" end="01:44:50.679" style="s2">and hold it tight but once it slips away</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.570" end="01:44:53.980" style="s2">we forget that it slipped away conceived</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.679" end="01:44:55.449" style="s2">we conceal the we forget the concealment</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.980" end="01:44:59.710" style="s2">and come up with something new and</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.449" end="01:45:05.530" style="s2">something else and so the the way that</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.710" end="01:45:10.900" style="s2">Alethea ilithyia is is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.530" end="01:45:13.210" style="s2">the fundamental thought of Heidi&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:45:23.500" end="01:45:29.890" style="s2">self conceals and absconds and</p>

<p begin="01:46:17.469" end="01:46:21.579" style="s2">enough that&#39;s when something lights up</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.179" end="01:46:23.769" style="s2">but that&#39;s when the world begins to</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.579" end="01:46:25.899" style="s2">light up in a very different way but it</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.769" end="01:46:27.879" style="s2">but it but it lights up in a way that it</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.899" end="01:46:33.189" style="s2">makes sense right</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.879" end="01:46:35.229" style="s2">tired so yeah and has this strangeness</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.189" end="01:46:38.050" style="s2">to it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.229" end="01:46:41.079" style="s2">yes but it&#39;s all about you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.050" end="01:46:45.269" style="s2">meister eckhart right before was a</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.079" end="01:46:47.949" style="s2">beautiful quote by a cut where he says</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.269" end="01:46:51.969" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say in German first I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.949" end="01:46:55.869" style="s2">get house behind here why do you go out</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.969" end="01:46:58.689" style="s2">to return home yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.869" end="01:47:01.300" style="s2">it that&#39;s what we do this is we have to</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.689" end="01:47:05.109" style="s2">go out into the world and into the</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.300" end="01:47:08.459" style="s2">uncanny into strangeness but but but why</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.109" end="01:47:13.030" style="s2">not not to stay there but right I&#39;m back</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.459" end="01:47:17.999" style="s2">because a sense of home and arriving you</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.030" end="01:47:21.489" style="s2">can only have that sense or no sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.999" end="01:47:25.629" style="s2">by by knowing what what it means to not</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.489" end="01:47:28.300" style="s2">be home these moments there everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.629" end="01:47:31.059" style="s2">whether you&#39;re thrown into the world you</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.300" end="01:47:33.550" style="s2">didn&#39;t choose yourself it&#39;s flying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.059" end="01:47:35.789" style="s2">a come home because you&#39;re not home yet</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.550" end="01:47:40.019" style="s2">right totally</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.789" end="01:47:40.019" style="s2">yeh couldn&#39;t have even have earned it</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.569" end="01:47:51.970" style="s2">yes Wow</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.690" end="01:47:53.470" style="s2">and I think maybe no the sixth sense I</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.970" end="01:47:55.660" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen it in a long time I I</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.470" end="01:47:58.390" style="s2">probably should what I&#39;d probably saw it</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.660" end="01:48:00.370" style="s2">before I started reading idea properties</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.390" end="01:48:03.160" style="s2">I should probably watch it again it</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.370" end="01:48:08.910" style="s2">might be that we know knowingly or not</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.160" end="01:48:13.960" style="s2">that what he&#39;s trying to do there is to</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.910" end="01:48:16.420" style="s2">to to show that in a you know in a story</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.960" end="01:48:19.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not about Bruce Willis being dead</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.420" end="01:48:21.430" style="s2">or not it&#39;s about how does concealment</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.090" end="01:48:24.490" style="s2">work that something&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.430" end="01:48:29.140" style="s2">lingering but not showing it&#39;s of it but</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.490" end="01:48:31.630" style="s2">I mean this yeah but does it look the</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.140" end="01:48:34.090" style="s2">strange thing is and I have this I get</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.630" end="01:48:36.520" style="s2">this you know responds quite often that</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.090" end="01:48:39.040" style="s2">if someone actually listens because what</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.520" end="01:48:40.420" style="s2">people would listen but if someone tries</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.040" end="01:48:43.360" style="s2">to listen we have a proper conversation</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.420" end="01:48:46.960" style="s2">which means to listen and then to</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.360" end="01:48:49.420" style="s2">respond and then I hear often you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.960" end="01:48:52.900" style="s2">something just lights up all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.420" end="01:48:57.940" style="s2">yeah when the reason is I think very</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.900" end="01:49:03.340" style="s2">simply by fully or not fully but but by</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.940" end="01:49:06.760" style="s2">trying to embrace concealments be once</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.340" end="01:49:13.360" style="s2">that happens once you think more in</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.760" end="01:49:16.690" style="s2">those terms malign up yeah it may really</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.360" end="01:49:19.140" style="s2">make sense because again the shadows are</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.690" end="01:49:21.580" style="s2">in the cave the shadows are concealed</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.140" end="01:49:24.010" style="s2">there concealed in the sense they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.580" end="01:49:25.150" style="s2">very present yeah they&#39;re so present</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.010" end="01:49:26.710" style="s2">they make up the world of these</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.150" end="01:49:31.060" style="s2">prisoners they&#39;re totally happy with</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.710" end="01:49:31.780" style="s2">that right they&#39;re concealed as what</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.060" end="01:49:35.350" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.780" end="01:49:38.170" style="s2">so by someone who&#39;s sort of become aware</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.350" end="01:49:40.240" style="s2">of that concealment you can come back</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.170" end="01:49:42.820" style="s2">down and see these shadows for what they</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.240" end="01:49:45.750" style="s2">are so you see it always it needs that</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.820" end="01:49:49.270" style="s2">double movement at least of concealment</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.750" end="01:49:51.490" style="s2">unconsumed and disclosure enclosure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.270" end="01:49:54.480" style="s2">you then point to something that is but</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.490" end="01:49:57.280" style="s2">as we know from Plato&#39;s cave the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.480" end="01:50:02.770" style="s2">yes that the punishment for that is</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.280" end="01:50:04.270" style="s2">death this to I it&#39;s funny I just had</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.770" end="01:50:05.830" style="s2">this like one of the things that clicked</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.270" end="01:50:10.300" style="s2">is you we&#39;ve been talking about this oh</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.830" end="01:50:12.250" style="s2">yeah in some way like to become pregnant</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.300" end="01:50:16.170" style="s2">he said become present to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.250" end="01:50:18.730" style="s2">concealments right yeah yeah actually I</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.170" end="01:50:20.230" style="s2">what I heard of that is that almost kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.730" end="01:50:24.580" style="s2">of like can make it your task to</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.230" end="01:50:26.260" style="s2">actually become present to them and</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.580" end="01:50:28.270" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is like I just kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.260" end="01:50:29.950" style="s2">of thought this the sense of like and</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.270" end="01:50:34.360" style="s2">then he started talking about real</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.950" end="01:50:36.940" style="s2">listening and then I was like oh you</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.360" end="01:50:38.710" style="s2">know I&#39;ve been wondering about this</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.940" end="01:50:41.350" style="s2">because it seems like that like</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.710" end="01:50:43.570" style="s2">metaphorically speaking your eyes can</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.350" end="01:50:45.550" style="s2">see what&#39;s concealed but they can only</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.570" end="01:50:49.390" style="s2">see surfaces right if you look at it</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.550" end="01:50:54.040" style="s2">just mechanically yeah but hearing right</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.390" end="01:50:59.920" style="s2">I by knock on the desk right what I hear</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.040" end="01:51:02.440" style="s2">is that is is what&#39;s campus and like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.920" end="01:51:06.310" style="s2">wondering about it listening good yes</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.440" end="01:51:11.730" style="s2">exactly but you know attunement to</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.310" end="01:51:11.730" style="s2">conceal yeah yes look let me knock okay</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.750" end="01:51:26.410" style="s2">we hear the silence after the knock this</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.670" end="01:51:34.060" style="s2">is what he talks but that&#39;s alloys</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.410" end="01:51:35.710" style="s2">destiny the ringing of silence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.060" end="01:51:39.790" style="s2">why hearing and listening is so</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.710" end="01:51:41.560" style="s2">important and Heraclitus speaking of</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.790" end="01:51:43.900" style="s2">backgrounds you know Heidegger says that</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.560" end="01:51:45.880" style="s2">he had especially towards the end of his</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.900" end="01:51:50.530" style="s2">life ever more the sensational</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.880" end="01:51:52.480" style="s2">Heraclitus was standing behind him he</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.530" end="01:51:54.490" style="s2">mentioned background right that&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.480" end="01:51:56.560" style="s2">could think of it as that who&#39;s behind</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.490" end="01:51:59.380" style="s2">me that and for him it was Heraclitus</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.560" end="01:52:04.270" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve you know categorized as</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.380" end="01:52:06.430" style="s2">the first fragment of Heraclitus in 19th</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.270" end="01:52:09.250" style="s2">century scholarship</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.430" end="01:52:10.890" style="s2">is Heraclitus speaks of logos and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.250" end="01:52:14.830" style="s2">not saying that logos is this you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.890" end="01:52:18.010" style="s2">fantastical regulating principle of the</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.830" end="01:52:20.380" style="s2">universe but logos is Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.010" end="01:52:23.350" style="s2">transcends logos as original primordial</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.380" end="01:52:28.090" style="s2">gathering it&#39;s what brings all of us</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.350" end="01:52:29.350" style="s2">sort of into in attunement all right</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.090" end="01:52:31.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what the logo that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.350" end="01:52:35.050" style="s2">that&#39;s a buttload so it&#39;s not like logos</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.960" end="01:52:38.290" style="s2">is here and it does this it that what we</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.050" end="01:52:44.530" style="s2">call logos is that which is why you have</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.290" end="01:52:46.420" style="s2">to use that is that which excuse us to</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.530" end="01:52:50.350" style="s2">gather yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.420" end="01:52:52.210" style="s2">and now Heraclitus says this is how you</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.350" end="01:52:55.120" style="s2">get an unsubstantial way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.210" end="01:52:58.530" style="s2">just point this out i Heraclitus says</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.120" end="01:53:02.610" style="s2">that you know people are always already</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.530" end="01:53:06.820" style="s2">hearing or our anus certain stance</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.610" end="01:53:09.730" style="s2">towards logos but they&#39;re not hearing</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.820" end="01:53:11.830" style="s2">logos are cooing they&#39;re not hearing it</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.730" end="01:53:15.130" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about reading the logos</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.830" end="01:53:19.810" style="s2">right in it and then it&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.130" end="01:53:23.500" style="s2">hearing that primordial origination or</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.810" end="01:53:25.810" style="s2">occurrence of gathering that then brings</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.500" end="01:53:27.730" style="s2">us again then could light something up</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.810" end="01:53:30.580" style="s2">but it&#39;s important that it&#39;s not hearing</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.730" end="01:53:32.680" style="s2">it&#39;s if you if there&#39;s not hearing then</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.580" end="01:53:36.310" style="s2">there&#39;s always there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.680" end="01:53:41.010" style="s2">concealment at work as well right and</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.310" end="01:53:47.650" style="s2">that consumer however if it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:53:41.010" end="01:53:49.030" style="s2">paradoxically focused on and then I mean</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.650" end="01:53:50.560" style="s2">logically this makes no sense right</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.030" end="01:53:52.750" style="s2">because if you say if I focus on there</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.560" end="01:53:56.400" style="s2">to conceal them actually I&#39;m concealing</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.750" end="01:54:04.120" style="s2">it but we don&#39;t care about that so but</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.400" end="01:54:06.250" style="s2">but then it lights up as as as that then</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.120" end="01:54:08.200" style="s2">all of a sudden we get attune to that</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.250" end="01:54:12.190" style="s2">which is I mean this is how you can only</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.200" end="01:54:14.830" style="s2">put it and again you knock on the table</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.190" end="01:54:16.840" style="s2">and he&#39;ll hear the silence yeah yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.830" end="01:54:19.300" style="s2">he hear it after there was something</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.840" end="01:54:23.679" style="s2">there that&#39;s then lingering into</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.300" end="01:54:28.530" style="s2">to the presence it&#39;s like music it seems</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.679" end="01:54:34.420" style="s2">it seems well yes I mean exactly so a</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.530" end="01:54:37.059" style="s2">live orchestra yeah it is the best one</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.420" end="01:54:39.969" style="s2">of the best examples maybe to to show</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.059" end="01:54:40.619" style="s2">what would thinkers like Heraclitus and</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.969" end="01:54:44.650" style="s2">Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:54:40.619" end="01:54:50.489" style="s2">who maybe by accident have both names</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.650" end="01:54:54.929" style="s2">inside with an age but it&#39;s it&#39;s a but</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.489" end="01:54:59.230" style="s2">the orchestra a classical Orchestra is</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.929" end="01:55:01.540" style="s2">tension-filled all right just look at</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.230" end="01:55:03.969" style="s2">the instruments most of them are string</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.540" end="01:55:05.829" style="s2">instruments yet I play guitar maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.969" end="01:55:08.349" style="s2">play a string instrument a string</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.829" end="01:55:12.340" style="s2">instrument is just under a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.349" end="01:55:14.500" style="s2">pressure and tension yeah you have fifty</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.340" end="01:55:16.719" style="s2">twenty people thirty people fifty go in</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.500" end="01:55:22.719" style="s2">an army in an orchestra however Beckett</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.719" end="01:55:27.579" style="s2">admit it maybe it doesn&#39;t in insane or</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.719" end="01:55:30.460" style="s2">immense tension in the air in the</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.579" end="01:55:33.400" style="s2">atmosphere just because they are you</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.460" end="01:55:36.849" style="s2">know excited and nervous to play just</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.400" end="01:55:39.940" style="s2">the individual members of the orchestra</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.849" end="01:55:41.559" style="s2">and so is the conductor who has to bring</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.940" end="01:55:46.000" style="s2">all of this together and bring it into</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.559" end="01:55:47.409" style="s2">what into harmony yeah so harmony is not</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.000" end="01:55:50.110" style="s2">because we have you know we have these</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.409" end="01:55:51.730" style="s2">cushy ideas of everything harmony is</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.110" end="01:55:54.570" style="s2">just everyone gets along it&#39;s all nice</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.730" end="01:55:57.159" style="s2">and no harmony is something easy</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.570" end="01:55:59.710" style="s2">incredibly difficult to bring about and</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.159" end="01:56:01.480" style="s2">if it&#39;s brought about it is tension they</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.710" end="01:56:03.520" style="s2">could always go wrong I&#39;m just imagine</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.480" end="01:56:07.300" style="s2">one of them playing one wrong note and</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.520" end="01:56:11.469" style="s2">it all sounds just the tension that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.300" end="01:56:15.360" style="s2">there but what&#39;s so what this is trying</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.469" end="01:56:18.099" style="s2">I think to what this can illustrate is</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.360" end="01:56:20.260" style="s2">or show us and this is something that we</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.099" end="01:56:22.179" style="s2">do is that there is a gathering that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.260" end="01:56:25.540" style="s2">that&#39;s happening there and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.179" end="01:56:29.440" style="s2">proper listening and as I then then</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.540" end="01:56:31.329" style="s2">there is a sort of coming together where</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.440" end="01:56:32.380" style="s2">as you put it you know before they</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.329" end="01:56:35.110" style="s2">exactly is that</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.380" end="01:56:38.230" style="s2">the note that was just played is not</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.110" end="01:56:41.140" style="s2">lost it&#39;s actually coming back in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.230" end="01:56:42.580" style="s2">next know that I&#39;m taking it to the next</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.140" end="01:56:44.980" style="s2">node and taking that song</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.580" end="01:56:47.680" style="s2">that&#39;s how melody arises I mean a melody</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.980" end="01:56:50.440" style="s2">would never arise if the time actually</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.680" end="01:56:55.120" style="s2">just passed sorry if time just passed</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.440" end="01:56:57.820" style="s2">which is boom boom boom boom yeah how is</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.120" end="01:57:00.400" style="s2">how does why would bamm-bamm sound like</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.820" end="01:57:02.140" style="s2">I&#39;m not really a nice melody but you</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.400" end="01:57:07.000" style="s2">have have a certain ring to it because</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.140" end="01:57:09.100" style="s2">the one note is playing again in the</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.000" end="01:57:11.260" style="s2">next and coming back up again</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.100" end="01:57:13.780" style="s2">that&#39;s honey it&#39;s a melody see it comes</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.260" end="01:57:17.890" style="s2">from what has been yes</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.780" end="01:57:21.430" style="s2">moving into well there was like lapsing</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.890" end="01:57:24.520" style="s2">into beverages to come forming a present</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.430" end="01:57:27.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a melody even that&#39;s how you can</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.520" end="01:57:30.850" style="s2">write music if you think of time just as</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.100" end="01:57:33.190" style="s2">passing by have no melody you have no</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.850" end="01:57:35.320" style="s2">music this you couldn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.190" end="01:57:38.170" style="s2">even yeah getting you wouldn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.320" end="01:57:40.720" style="s2">sense of who you are and ultimately I</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.170" end="01:57:43.840" style="s2">think to make is a bit you know</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.720" end="01:57:46.690" style="s2">dystopian this is perhaps where some of</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.840" end="01:57:51.100" style="s2">this is going is that if you are trapped</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.690" end="01:57:53.560" style="s2">in a fake presence like the Netflix kono</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.100" end="01:57:56.290" style="s2">binge watching presence for example you</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.560" end="01:57:59.500" style="s2">are know many people describe it they</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.290" end="01:58:01.230" style="s2">watch Netflix for 10 hours didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.500" end="01:58:04.750" style="s2">remember anything on what they&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.230" end="01:58:08.350" style="s2">you see the memory is lacking yeah</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.750" end="01:58:11.740" style="s2">but so there is no to certain agreed</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.350" end="01:58:14.200" style="s2">melodies melody how harmony true harmony</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.740" end="01:58:18.420" style="s2">is lacking from from from our way of</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.200" end="01:58:23.290" style="s2">being but just say it again the way that</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.420" end="01:58:26.080" style="s2">we can listen to a melody is because the</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.290" end="01:58:31.350" style="s2">note that was just played is lingering</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.080" end="01:58:32.800" style="s2">on next and in the next in the next and</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.350" end="01:58:35.700" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.800" end="01:58:40.240" style="s2">to certain degrees if you begin to</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.700" end="01:58:42.280" style="s2">understand history like that then it you</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.240" end="01:58:45.670" style="s2">know phenomena begin to light up and</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.280" end="01:58:48.250" style="s2">that means that there isn&#39;t some you</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.670" end="01:58:49.960" style="s2">know ingenious subject who go look this</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.250" end="01:58:52.720" style="s2">is what it&#39;s like no it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.960" end="01:58:53.470" style="s2">phenomena show themselves from</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.720" end="01:58:57.790" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.470" end="01:59:00.820" style="s2">if one less them show themselves right</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.790" end="01:59:07.510" style="s2">but to do that you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.820" end="01:59:10.390" style="s2">let silence ring is it fair to say like</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.510" end="01:59:12.460" style="s2">with Nietzsche yeah</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.390" end="01:59:14.710" style="s2">like you really did name it like God</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.460" end="01:59:17.290" style="s2">like that I think it&#39;s Tomlinson he</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.710" end="01:59:22.270" style="s2">talked about like he named the Anto</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.290" end="01:59:26.730" style="s2">theology of the like eternal like the</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.270" end="01:59:30.370" style="s2">the Thea the Theo the the God&#39;s eye view</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.730" end="01:59:35.710" style="s2">eternal return of the same that the Anto</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.370" end="01:59:39.670" style="s2">the innermost view right the the will</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.710" end="01:59:42.520" style="s2">write that yeah and there so like the</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.670" end="01:59:47.350" style="s2">money being like you know the up surging</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.520" end="01:59:49.840" style="s2">of a kind of meaningless will to eternal</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.350" end="01:59:52.060" style="s2">record of the same for itself but but it</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.840" end="01:59:55.630" style="s2">but it exactly yeah that&#39;s what it has</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.060" end="02:00:00.820" style="s2">to do yeah but to hear that like I just</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.630" end="02:00:04.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like what a feat that was to hear</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.820" end="02:00:05.710" style="s2">that right before beforehand and I</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.180" end="02:00:07.720" style="s2">wondering if it&#39;s fair to say that</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.710" end="02:00:12.280" style="s2">something like hearing that is something</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.720" end="02:00:14.410" style="s2">like this like with it like music if you</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.280" end="02:00:16.960" style="s2">slow music down I thought about this a</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.410" end="02:00:19.120" style="s2">bunch of like what is that point where</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.960" end="02:00:22.390" style="s2">like if you slow music down you can</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.120" end="02:00:24.970" style="s2">still hear the rhythm right go down and</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.390" end="02:00:27.640" style="s2">at some point it becomes farther</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.970" end="02:00:29.170" style="s2">probably far enough away such that you</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.640" end="02:00:32.920" style="s2">don&#39;t hear the rhythm anymore and then</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.170" end="02:00:35.200" style="s2">the found that you hear is not in</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.920" end="02:00:37.720" style="s2">relationship to other things because you</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.200" end="02:00:40.450" style="s2">can&#39;t cool it doesn&#39;t linger long enough</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.720" end="02:00:44.530" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m wondering if something like</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.450" end="02:00:47.739" style="s2">Nietzsche like was able to back up</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.530" end="02:00:52.010" style="s2">enough such that like</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.739" end="02:00:54.739" style="s2">the shot like that the two beats are the</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.010" end="02:00:56.210" style="s2">two melodies like God like this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.739" end="02:00:58.010" style="s2">something with his hearing where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.210" end="02:01:00.110" style="s2">like he was able to like back up enough</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.010" end="02:01:03.920" style="s2">so it where it got close like modernity</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.110" end="02:01:07.400" style="s2">the beats of modernity he could hear the</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.920" end="02:01:09.560" style="s2">song and then that was his understanding</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.400" end="02:01:11.270" style="s2">is that deep is that a fair analogy you</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.560" end="02:01:14.120" style="s2">think like cuz I&#39;m often talking about</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.270" end="02:01:19.190" style="s2">that that understanding is like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.120" end="02:01:21.140" style="s2">like oh I hear the music it&#39;s got that</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.190" end="02:01:25.610" style="s2">history like oh it makes sense it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.140" end="02:01:28.489" style="s2">them yeah no yeah yes very much like you</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.610" end="02:01:31.060" style="s2">know you you know is of course I&#39;m Aidid</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.489" end="02:01:34.130" style="s2">Jade for a long time and and DJ isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.060" end="02:01:35.780" style="s2">you&#39;re not using your medium it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.130" end="02:01:38.300" style="s2">means your medium you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.780" end="02:01:40.580" style="s2">making music you&#39;re the music is the</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.300" end="02:01:45.980" style="s2">medium and in the actual thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.580" end="02:01:47.719" style="s2">making is a move right yeah yeah which</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.980" end="02:01:49.160" style="s2">is really cool like that&#39;s all I like to</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.719" end="02:01:51.710" style="s2">think of it it&#39;s like you know cook your</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.160" end="02:01:54.320" style="s2">cooking but yeah exactly but I think the</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.710" end="02:01:59.840" style="s2">design is key sheeted right being</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.320" end="02:02:03.400" style="s2">history it&#39;s ultimately a melody that</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.840" end="02:02:07.699" style="s2">Heidegger listens to that hiding is clay</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.400" end="02:02:09.650" style="s2">right in the distance yeah he responds</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.699" end="02:02:15.410" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.650" end="02:02:18.580" style="s2">and it has its ups and downs in its its</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.410" end="02:02:21.320" style="s2">terrible moments and it&#39;s it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.580" end="02:02:23.360" style="s2">disclosures but it is a melody yes we</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.320" end="02:02:26.960" style="s2">were responding to but look I mean you</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.360" end="02:02:28.640" style="s2">to you know speculate again why is it</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.960" end="02:02:32.570" style="s2">that anywhere you go you hear shitty</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.640" end="02:02:36.949" style="s2">music right anywhere you go in any</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.570" end="02:02:40.960" style="s2">restaurant any any coffee shop or any</p>

<p begin="02:05:43.010" end="02:05:49.460" style="s2">you buy as much as you can because that</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.870" end="02:05:51.650" style="s2">gives you something to hold on so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.460" end="02:05:54.680" style="s2">your identity you&#39;re buying an identity</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.650" end="02:05:59.450" style="s2">right because you have no memory of who</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.680" end="02:06:02.030" style="s2">you are and yes and and this is why we</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.450" end="02:06:04.760" style="s2">need like we need Auto silence at some</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.030" end="02:06:08.360" style="s2">point again right we we need to be able</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.760" end="02:06:11.660" style="s2">to listen to silence and and and then a</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.360" end="02:06:15.410" style="s2">melody this closes itself that then</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.660" end="02:06:17.840" style="s2">gives you sort of that that is it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.410" end="02:06:21.100" style="s2">is Heidi I think he he says it a couple</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.840" end="02:06:24.380" style="s2">of times that this isn&#39;t some some grand</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.100" end="02:06:26.510" style="s2">enlightenment moment right this comes on</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.380" end="02:06:31.370" style="s2">like Nietzsche puts it on Tufts feed it</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.510" end="02:06:35.120" style="s2">comes very silently over you and then it</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.370" end="02:06:38.030" style="s2">slowly takes over your entire being and</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.120" end="02:06:42.880" style="s2">and I think that that should ultimately</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.030" end="02:06:46.370" style="s2">be sort of the the goal of or the aim of</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.880" end="02:06:48.230" style="s2">well the purpose of any of this is that</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.370" end="02:06:53.739" style="s2">it actually means something in the sense</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.230" end="02:06:57.650" style="s2">that it changes a way of being yes yeah</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.739" end="02:07:05.300" style="s2">right that sense of yes okay that sense</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.650" end="02:07:08.870" style="s2">of it&#39;s like where that sense of you</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.300" end="02:07:13.310" style="s2">know like you you understand or you were</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.870" end="02:07:16.360" style="s2">know it like knowing is you know through</p>

<p begin="02:07:16.360" end="02:07:23.570" style="s2">that sense of like it like an i my</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.060" end="02:07:25.730" style="s2">understanding of like with Plato like it</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.570" end="02:07:29.120" style="s2">sounds like that you had somebody that</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.730" end="02:07:32.570" style="s2">you read Plato like really read Plato</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.120" end="02:07:34.280" style="s2">right of where it&#39;s like he just like</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.570" end="02:07:37.670" style="s2">the nowadays usually read a book and</p>
<p begin="02:07:34.280" end="02:07:40.880" style="s2">read Plato like that&#39;s not how it was</p>

<p begin="02:07:40.880" end="02:07:46.460" style="s2">read Plato is - you got enact it right</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.690" end="02:07:49.730" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that an embodied</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.460" end="02:07:52.700" style="s2">enactment that like you actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.730" end="02:07:56.090" style="s2">agree with it but you what is it it&#39;s</p>
