<p begin="00:00:19.670" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">there are two ways of meditating on</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:29.820" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:32.850" style="s2">one is the morbid way which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.820" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">avoidance of life and a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.850" end="00:00:37.290" style="s2">nothing is worthwhile because it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.530" end="00:00:40.770" style="s2">going to come to an end and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.290" end="00:00:44.370" style="s2">the creative way of recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.770" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">that your mortality is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.370" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">part of all that you hope for you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">when we fall in love with another when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:55.740" style="s2">when one falls in love with another</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">person one is consciously taking under</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.740" end="00:01:02.040" style="s2">one&#39;s care a mortal being and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">sense of her fragility and her mortality</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.040" end="00:01:08.130" style="s2">which is fundamental to the so their</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">love that one feels towards her in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.130" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">view and if you try and exclude the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">thought of death then that love is</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">weakened and the set the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">have that she is absolutely dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:26.569" style="s2">that love and of course will one day</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:29.250" style="s2">escape from it and through death that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.569" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">absolutely a part of what the love is</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.250" end="00:01:35.190" style="s2">and why we find in erotic love a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">redemption that&#39;s um that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.190" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">say attempt I would say as well that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s an aid to concentration and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:46.530" style="s2">focus you don&#39;t have much time and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of problems and so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.530" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">and and and it&#39;s going to be a hard road</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:56.550" style="s2">no matter what and so get at it you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:01:58.709" style="s2">for years when I was in my 20s the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.550" end="00:02:01.500" style="s2">thought I had when I woke up in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.709" end="00:02:03.569" style="s2">morning was life is short and really</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.500" end="00:02:06.539" style="s2">literally it happened to me for years</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.569" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">and I thought no time to waste then</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.539" end="00:02:10.380" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s things to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">done there&#39;s things that need doing get</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.380" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">the hell up make yourself efficient aim</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">at something that makes the transience</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:21.090" style="s2">of life worthwhile because such things</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:23.340" style="s2">exist and then and then do everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.090" end="00:02:27.090" style="s2">you can to manifest everything you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.340" end="00:02:29.220" style="s2">within that mortal frame and and it adds</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.090" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">to life of a seriousness that would</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.220" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">otherwise be absent</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:40.180" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.080" end="00:03:07.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you my plumbers story because</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.150" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">that makes it concrete I&#39;ve done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.130" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">of home renovation I&#39;ve worked with lots</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:14.180" style="s2">of workmen and on very creative projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">as a matter of fact and so that was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.180" end="00:03:19.160" style="s2">entertaining because with carpenters for</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:21.050" style="s2">example we built a quite strange and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.160" end="00:03:23.630" style="s2">unique third floor on my house in</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.050" end="00:03:25.250" style="s2">Toronto and I invited the carpenters to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.630" end="00:03:26.660" style="s2">contribute I told them what the overall</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.250" end="00:03:28.330" style="s2">view was and what we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.660" end="00:03:30.650" style="s2">produce but if they had creative ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:33.320" style="s2">then I was welcoming them because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.650" end="00:03:35.030" style="s2">wanted them to I didn&#39;t want to tell</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.320" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">them what to do I wanted to produce</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.030" end="00:03:38.990" style="s2">something beautiful with them fully on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">board so that it was likely to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.990" end="00:03:44.120" style="s2">itself in the best possible manner and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">so that competence that that I described</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.120" end="00:03:49.400" style="s2">rather you in a you rather utilitarian</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:51.980" style="s2">manner is almost immediately transcended</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.400" end="00:03:54.740" style="s2">by something that&#39;s that&#39;s more potent</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.980" end="00:03:56.630" style="s2">and more valuable in the actuality of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.740" end="00:03:58.730" style="s2">and if you&#39;re participating in a project</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.630" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2">like that and you invite people into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.730" end="00:04:02.990" style="s2">reciprocal relationship then the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">relationship begins to transcend the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.990" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">particular these of the of the project</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:10.730" style="s2">and then the project goes wonderfully</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:12.470" style="s2">well so and that is a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:14.300" style="s2">something that&#39;s deeper in and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.470" end="00:04:16.609" style="s2">touches on something that sir Roger</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.300" end="00:04:18.200" style="s2">mentioned the statement by christ that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.609" end="00:04:20.120" style="s2">if two or three people are gathered</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.200" end="00:04:22.010" style="s2">together in his name then he&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.120" end="00:04:23.540" style="s2">you can you can infuse every</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.010" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">relationship you have with precisely</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.540" end="00:04:29.510" style="s2">that spirit if you&#39;re cognizant of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:32.510" style="s2">and careful I mean it&#39;s unfortunate and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.510" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">and and far more than that it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.510" end="00:04:36.080" style="s2">to strive for and you won&#39;t manifest</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:38.360" style="s2">itself perfectly but that can be there</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.080" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">and all the particularity and so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.360" end="00:04:43.250" style="s2">way you have the the singularity of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">project itself the practicality of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.250" end="00:04:47.030" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that Christ was also a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:49.070" style="s2">carpenter right that&#39;s the particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:52.130" style="s2">because a house that&#39;s not built on</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.070" end="00:04:53.900" style="s2">truth does not stand you know and so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.130" end="00:04:57.020" style="s2">those particular relationships should</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.900" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">partake of that divine the divinity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:03.650" style="s2">ultimate reciprocity and then both are</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">both are elevated and and so so it the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">the narrowness of say capitalist trade</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">is insufficient but it&#39;s embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:13.380" style="s2">something that when it&#39;s not a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:17.100" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s embedded in something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">far deeper than that and far more</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.100" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">gratifying and if and if you&#39;re careful</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:23.640" style="s2">about such things then the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:26.930" style="s2">you involve yourself with that or even</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.640" end="00:05:30.890" style="s2">somewhat mundane can take on a much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.930" end="00:05:34.200" style="s2">much much more beautiful and productive</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.890" end="00:05:36.540" style="s2">nature and then that&#39;s well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.200" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">frustrating it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s compelling</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.540" end="00:05:44.190" style="s2">and it works so yeah I would just add to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:48.600" style="s2">that that what Jordan has said really is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.190" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">that in a job rightly done the divine is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.600" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">imminent</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:53.760" style="s2">in some way you know what George Herbert</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:58.680" style="s2">said in whose sweets of rumors for thy</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.760" end="00:06:00.630" style="s2">laws makes that and the action fine okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.680" end="00:06:04.460" style="s2">we leave out these days that drug makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.630" end="00:06:06.660" style="s2">drudgery divine bit but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.460" end="00:06:09.510" style="s2">Herbert was absolutely right about that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.660" end="00:06:12.420" style="s2">that if you ask a question where does</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.510" end="00:06:14.370" style="s2">God enter the ordinary life it is in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.420" end="00:06:17.940" style="s2">that sense of doing something for its</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.370" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">own sake and and acquiring the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.940" end="00:06:24.660" style="s2">doing so and not wanting a reward beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.130" end="00:06:26.730" style="s2">the thing which is connects with</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.660" end="00:06:31.470" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s conception what a virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.730" end="00:06:33.450" style="s2">as well so one shouldn&#39;t despair that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.470" end="00:06:36.120" style="s2">there is a moral education available to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.450" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">us even in a world where there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.120" end="00:06:43.410" style="s2">formalized and shared religion that will</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:46.220" style="s2">bring that aspect of things to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.410" end="00:06:46.220" style="s2">human life</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.040" end="00:06:54.100" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.890" end="00:07:28.700" style="s2">what I what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.520" end="00:07:32.600" style="s2">happiness means ultimately the full your</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.700" end="00:07:35.090" style="s2">fulfillment as a person and that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.600" end="00:07:38.450" style="s2">that isn&#39;t the same as gratification of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.090" end="00:07:42.980" style="s2">your desires it is it means the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.450" end="00:07:44.870" style="s2">transformation of your you&#39;re being such</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.980" end="00:07:47.900" style="s2">that you can look on what you are and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.870" end="00:07:51.410" style="s2">say for all my faults</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.900" end="00:07:54.860" style="s2">I accept that thing and that and when</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.410" end="00:07:57.710" style="s2">there an occasion comes to rejoice you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.860" end="00:07:59.990" style="s2">accept it and enter it rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.710" end="00:08:04.270" style="s2">is say asking yourself do I deserve it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.990" end="00:08:08.090" style="s2">you know those yeah that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.270" end="00:08:10.250" style="s2">avoidance of joy which many people have</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.090" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">is actually itself a kind of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.250" end="00:08:16.940" style="s2">the happy person goes out and embraces</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:22.250" style="s2">the the occasion for for rejoicing and</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.280" end="00:09:45.020" style="s2">would say I do that primarily by playing</p>

<p begin="00:09:47.270" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2">time with my kids it was non-stop jokes</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.030" end="00:09:53.720" style="s2">of one form or another my daughter can</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:56.780" style="s2">barely say anything that that isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:58.580" style="s2">joke of some sort you know and I hang</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.780" end="00:10:00.200" style="s2">around with comedians all the time and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.580" end="00:10:02.780" style="s2">usually have my best discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.200" end="00:10:04.940" style="s2">them and my best friends when I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.780" end="00:10:07.700" style="s2">especially when I was a young young man</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.940" end="00:10:10.010" style="s2">were people who were inveterate IRA</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.700" end="00:10:12.260" style="s2">nests and joke tellers and mostly what</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.010" end="00:10:14.540" style="s2">we did was competitive humor the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.260" end="00:10:16.340" style="s2">goal of a social gathering was to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.540" end="00:10:18.410" style="s2">who could say the most outrageously</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.340" end="00:10:22.190" style="s2">funny thing and and that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.410" end="00:10:24.080" style="s2">unbelievably entertaining and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.190" end="00:10:28.370" style="s2">if that comes along and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.080" end="00:10:29.060" style="s2">participate in it and you can play so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.370" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">much the better</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.060" end="00:10:34.430" style="s2">and so it&#39;s even useful to touch things</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:36.500" style="s2">that are difficult with a playful and</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.430" end="00:10:38.390" style="s2">light hand which is partly why I travel</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.500" end="00:10:40.400" style="s2">with Dave Rubin in my lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.390" end="00:10:42.410" style="s2">because Dave&#39;s a professional stand-up</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.400" end="00:10:45.730" style="s2">comedian as well as a serious person in</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:48.230" style="s2">his own right but all of the very</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.730" end="00:10:50.030" style="s2">disturbing lectures that I put forward</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.230" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">because I think they are disturbing are</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.030" end="00:10:55.010" style="s2">lavend with with humor and and that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:59.300" style="s2">there&#39;s purpose that&#39;s that&#39;s purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.010" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary and desirable so but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.300" end="00:11:03.290" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">short-term happiness is a goal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.290" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">which I certainly don&#39;t think that it is</p>
