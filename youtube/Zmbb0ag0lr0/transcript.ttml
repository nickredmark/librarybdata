<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:08.099" style="s2">so in the first video which is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.480" end="00:00:11.429" style="s2">this one let&#39;s talk about the the niche</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.099" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">that has I think been produced by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">combination of the much longer than</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">normal power of the boomers and their</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">particular way of behavior basically in</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.250" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">particular their children Millennials so</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">a decent chunk and remember of course</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">reality is super complex and everything</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">is always much more complicated than any</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:38.250" style="s2">given particular explanation could</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">possibly account for so this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.250" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">piece but it&#39;s an interesting piece um</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:44.730" style="s2">so let&#39;s see one of the characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:46.289" style="s2">that I think is really important</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.730" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on right now is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">that Millennials have developed as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">group more or less obviously quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">of diversity among whom Allah nails</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:01:00.539" style="s2">aren&#39;t but more or less in a context</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">that has two or three primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.539" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">characteristics one characteristic is if</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">much higher than ordinary in human</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">experience level of the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">authority so this is the whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">being raised in the context where</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:21.930" style="s2">there&#39;s always some kind of authority</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:24.750" style="s2">apparent around you no more playing by</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.930" end="00:01:29.400" style="s2">yourself out in the wilderness always</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">some kind of playground coach five being</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.400" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">Sherpa back and forth in minivans to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">play dates and things like that and by</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.470" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">the way more as time has worn on so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">is even even more true for the youngest</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:43.170" style="s2">Millennials and probably even more true</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">for the oldest of Gen Z you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:47.990" style="s2">certainly even more true the oldest to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">Jen Z so I&#39;m gonna call this a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.990" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">infantilization this is a separation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">a relationship with reality physical</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:00.680" style="s2">reality nature and to meaningful extent</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:03.420" style="s2">also relationship with your peers</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.680" end="00:02:06.810" style="s2">outside of a context of having a an</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.420" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">adult Authority in in in charge of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.810" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:12.299" style="s2">and this by the way was pretty famously</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">noticed for Millennials in the context</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.299" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">of I think was called helicopter</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:17.879" style="s2">parenting where you had for the very</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">first time parents who would show up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.879" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">college context and university context</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:24.569" style="s2">and have direct conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:28.109" style="s2">college professors on behalf of their</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.569" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">college-age children and and and if that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.109" end="00:02:33.000" style="s2">seems ordinary to you I assure you up</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:35.969" style="s2">until ten fifteen years ago it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:37.769" style="s2">extraordinary it was been absurd for my</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.969" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">parents to show up at my university and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.769" end="00:02:43.620" style="s2">have a conversation on my behalf with</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:44.939" style="s2">with a professor they may have had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.620" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">conversation with the professor to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.939" end="00:02:49.049" style="s2">interested in what was going on but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">notion that they would come in and kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.049" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">of tell a professor to treat me</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">differently it is just almost amusing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">and and yet I think that became at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:03:01.709" style="s2">somewhat common and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:03.269" style="s2">point all right so the point here is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.709" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s the offensive</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.269" end="00:03:08.519" style="s2">infantilization and I don&#39;t want him to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">sort of denigrate the Millennials as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.519" end="00:03:11.669" style="s2">consequence of using that term because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:13.229" style="s2">think obviously by definition they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.669" end="00:03:15.629" style="s2">the recipient and in many ways the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.229" end="00:03:18.659" style="s2">unwilling recipient of that so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.629" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">happens in that context and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.659" end="00:03:25.319" style="s2">like two distinct things happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:28.379" style="s2">simultaneously one is a real felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.319" end="00:03:31.260" style="s2">sorry a real felt sense and also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.379" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">reality of disempowerment a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.260" end="00:03:35.939" style="s2">agency a lack of real agency a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:38.790" style="s2">capacity to influence reality directly</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.939" end="00:03:40.409" style="s2">right in this context the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.790" end="00:03:42.349" style="s2">influence reality is indirectly</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.409" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">influenced reality by influencing</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.349" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">Authority okay so you yourself don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:51.019" style="s2">actually have direct agency in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:54.509" style="s2">what you have is the ability to cause</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.019" end="00:03:57.659" style="s2">another agent and authority to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.509" end="00:04:00.389" style="s2">a certain way so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.659" end="00:04:02.129" style="s2">in nature like you&#39;re you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.389" end="00:04:04.199" style="s2">forest you have to make a fire by</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.129" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">rubbing sticks together or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.199" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">have direct agency the only way to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:09.329" style="s2">the problem is through your own personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">capacity to do stuff with your body in</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.329" end="00:04:12.449" style="s2">your mind in the relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">something that does not care how you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.449" end="00:04:19.919" style="s2">feel or what you say but if there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">adult there and you try and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.919" end="00:04:21.850" style="s2">work and the way to get the fire to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">start it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.850" end="00:04:25.720" style="s2">you figure out how to convince the adult</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">to do it for you now agency has shifted</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.720" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">the center of agency is in your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">to be affected at the levels of social</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">interaction and my proposition is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:37.960" style="s2">this omnipresent or there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">thing that&#39;s present human field has</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.960" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">over the past twenty years or so in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">particularly in the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:48.480" style="s2">environment of Millennials and Gen Z</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:51.400" style="s2">really shifted in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.480" end="00:04:54.280" style="s2">agency as mediated is socially mediated</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.400" end="00:04:57.700" style="s2">and then the next thing that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.280" end="00:04:59.620" style="s2">you will adapt to that you know you will</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.700" end="00:05:04.030" style="s2">optimize for your niche all right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.620" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">what has happened is that pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.030" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">intentionally okay I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:09.250" style="s2">intentionally but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:12.010" style="s2">attention to it the boomers have created</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.250" end="00:05:16.150" style="s2">a context which hasn&#39;t Fanta lized the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.010" end="00:05:19.290" style="s2">Millennials and have created a niche</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.150" end="00:05:23.140" style="s2">where optimization for manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.290" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">boomer power structures has been the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.140" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2">primary mode for successful agency of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">huge cohort that Millennials not just I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.840" end="00:05:32.970" style="s2">don&#39;t mean everyone I don&#39;t even guess I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:36.490" style="s2">mean most but but the plurality at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.970" end="00:05:37.720" style="s2">as a sensibility and those so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.490" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">explains a lot of what we&#39;re seeing now</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.720" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">and what we&#39;re seeing is a real felt</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:47.470" style="s2">sense and a reality that agency is had</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:50.830" style="s2">through utilizing techniques to convince</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.470" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">authorities to change their behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.830" end="00:05:56.380" style="s2">by the way these techniques are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:58.660" style="s2">optimized to work on boomer authorities</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.380" end="00:06:02.260" style="s2">okay well why is that as that last piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.660" end="00:06:05.410" style="s2">so important well as Eric Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.260" end="00:06:09.250" style="s2">many others have noticed the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.410" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">which and the duration over power in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.250" end="00:06:13.180" style="s2">social institutions maintained by</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:14.620" style="s2">boomers is actually rather singular in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.180" end="00:06:17.530" style="s2">in history</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.620" end="00:06:19.300" style="s2">so the boomer generation has had more</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.530" end="00:06:21.880" style="s2">ubiquitous control over social</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.300" end="00:06:23.500" style="s2">institutions of all kinds and over a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.880" end="00:06:27.130" style="s2">longer period of time than we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.500" end="00:06:29.530" style="s2">seen before so it&#39;s a bit like a like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.130" end="00:06:32.790" style="s2">monoculture for optimization so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.530" end="00:06:34.840" style="s2">got a situation where you have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.790" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">infantilizing instinct and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.840" end="00:06:40.360" style="s2">instinct to to provide a kind of control</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.960" end="00:06:42.130" style="s2">structure to to wander how to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.360" end="00:06:43.960" style="s2">involved in controlling what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.130" end="00:06:46.030" style="s2">probably for the benefit intentionally</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.290" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">now you&#39;ll see a lot of that you&#39;ll see</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.340" end="00:08:18.370" style="s2">to be theirs to take acting in a more</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.729" end="00:08:19.960" style="s2">adolescent fashion because they are in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.370" end="00:08:21.940" style="s2">fact separated from agency and have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.960" end="00:08:23.919" style="s2">separated from agency for effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.940" end="00:08:26.440" style="s2">their entire lives in a situation by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.919" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">way where they know things are up</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.440" end="00:08:32.260" style="s2">and need to change and their tool has</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">been to modulate the behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.260" end="00:08:37.300" style="s2">manipulate authorities now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.550" style="s2">really good at it and so the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.300" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">are basically just being a backward it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.550" end="00:08:43.150" style="s2">kind of like the barbarians invading the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:47.230" style="s2">Roman Empire like the boomers capacity</p>

<p begin="00:08:47.230" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">maybe nil I don&#39;t know but</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.780" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">things worse and the Millennials are</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.240" end="00:09:00.850" style="s2">sort of rushing through the gap but</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:03.820" style="s2">still in this mode of the way to behave</p>
