<p begin="00:32:11.250" end="00:32:16.260" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s move on to some other things</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.380" end="00:32:19.980" style="s2">here this is sort of near politics but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.260" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">it gets back to systems thinking which</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.980" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">is the web you know I was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:25.800" style="s2">early people that helped build what</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.580" end="00:32:28.800" style="s2">became the web and was involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.800" end="00:32:31.140" style="s2">for much of my business career and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.800" end="00:32:33.390" style="s2">thought frankly that we were both doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.140" end="00:32:35.940" style="s2">well and doing good that this ought to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.390" end="00:32:38.250" style="s2">be the mechanism for empowered</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.940" end="00:32:41.430" style="s2">citizenship everybody has access to</p>

<p begin="00:32:42.270" end="00:32:49.350" style="s2">etc and yet at the moment it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.990" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">a real shitstorm right really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.350" end="00:32:52.170" style="s2">stupid ideas you&#39;re making a big</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:54.810" style="s2">comeback</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.170" end="00:32:57.420" style="s2">I mean Nazis I mean what the hell right</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.810" end="00:33:00.270" style="s2">Nazis are coming back can you imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.420" end="00:33:03.110" style="s2">stupider idea than that well maybe one</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.270" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">flat earthers right they&#39;re coming back</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.110" end="00:33:09.780" style="s2">anti-vaxxers right you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">something about this new unmediated form</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.780" end="00:33:14.220" style="s2">of communication that we did not see</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:17.400" style="s2">when we were creating it that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.220" end="00:33:20.220" style="s2">producing a standing wave of some sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.400" end="00:33:23.580" style="s2">that&#39;s allowing really bad</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.220" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">to gain some traction now personally I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.580" end="00:33:28.530" style="s2">not as an alarmist as some people are I</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:31.230" style="s2">just I do believe that Nazis are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.530" end="00:33:33.539" style="s2">gonna take over America nor our flat</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.230" end="00:33:35.970" style="s2">earthers gonna take over our school</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.539" end="00:33:38.340" style="s2">system but it is nonetheless pretty</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.970" end="00:33:40.440" style="s2">disconcerting that there are you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.340" end="00:33:43.470" style="s2">significant numbers of people adhering</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.630" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">perspective number one is that it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.270" end="00:41:00.220" style="s2">and it can take us in it I have a paper</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.430" end="00:41:03.610" style="s2">about this look up disputation arenas in</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.220" end="00:41:06.190" style="s2">my name that when all is said and done</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.610" end="00:41:09.220" style="s2">after a year there is a generalized</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.190" end="00:41:11.650" style="s2">consensus that somebody won and but</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.220" end="00:41:15.190" style="s2">here&#39;s the more important thing both</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.650" end="00:41:18.100" style="s2">sides have altered their positions under</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.190" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">the brunt of criticism and that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.100" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">more likely outcome think of gun control</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">I mean if you had any people with</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:28.510" style="s2">intellectual honesty no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.440" end="00:41:30.340" style="s2">their starting positions on gun control</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.510" end="00:41:33.220" style="s2">I predict that their positions would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.340" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">both sides would be substantially</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.220" end="00:41:39.130" style="s2">changed within a few months of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:41.080" style="s2">process but then there&#39;s the question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.130" end="00:41:43.630" style="s2">how do you compel them to come to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.080" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">arena or how do you compel anyone to pay</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.630" end="00:41:46.570" style="s2">attention that&#39;s the real problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:49.120" style="s2">well those those are</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.570" end="00:41:50.920" style="s2">problems if people paid attention then</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.120" end="00:41:53.050" style="s2">advocates would come I mean we live in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.920" end="00:41:55.240" style="s2">an attention economy above all else</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.050" end="00:41:57.730" style="s2">right you&#39;re absolutely right and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.240" end="00:42:00.730" style="s2">what like in many problems in society</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.730" end="00:42:03.910" style="s2">today this would take a millionaire or a</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.730" end="00:42:06.820" style="s2">deca millionaire probably a cent a</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.910" end="00:42:08.410" style="s2">millionaire or well he&#39;d have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.820" end="00:42:10.180" style="s2">to come up I was worked it out it would</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.410" end="00:42:12.100" style="s2">take about five million dollars to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.180" end="00:42:13.840" style="s2">this rolling you know there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.100" end="00:42:18.100" style="s2">things there&#39;s so much money in that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.840" end="00:42:20.830" style="s2">upper caste and many of them do not like</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.100" end="00:42:23.980" style="s2">where things are going they can see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.830" end="00:42:27.100" style="s2">if you wind up where we will be so we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.220" end="00:42:53.530" style="s2">got in 1776 in 1860 but more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.030" end="00:42:57.220" style="s2">in 1898 and in and during the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.530" end="00:43:03.190" style="s2">generation and that is calmer resets and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.220" end="00:43:07.690" style="s2">we can get calm resets they might look</p>

<p begin="00:43:07.690" end="00:43:12.010" style="s2">would probably be surprised to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.180" end="00:43:14.200" style="s2">the tea party was such a wedged</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.010" end="00:43:17.590" style="s2">phenomenon and it was all the Liberals</p>

<p begin="00:43:50.620" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">happened after the Revolution was over</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.390" end="00:43:58.210" style="s2">it&#39;s astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:44:00.730" style="s2">the founders seized</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.270" end="00:46:12.770" style="s2">talked a lot about which is the</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.770" end="00:46:16.460" style="s2">started to read that book the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:18.350" style="s2">transparent society and I read a little</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.460" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">bit in the in the front several pages</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.350" end="00:46:22.700" style="s2">and then I realized man this is really</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:24.530" style="s2">old so let&#39;s talk about it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.700" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">nonetheless it&#39;s a little bit I read you</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.530" end="00:46:29.360" style="s2">are extremely prescient you&#39;re going oh</p>

<p begin="00:46:35.660" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">about cheap drones you even talked about</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:42.170" style="s2">drones that would fit in your hand and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:45.110" style="s2">this was in 1997 maybe something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.170" end="00:46:47.750" style="s2">that well not only that but if you look</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.110" end="00:46:51.590" style="s2">on page 160 there&#39;s a scene in which a</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.760" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">police have them sort of near their</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.530" end="00:47:27.590" style="s2">badge and the thing we desperately need</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:30.440" style="s2">is a lapel camera that uses the watch</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.590" end="00:47:32.890" style="s2">technology to connect to the phones so</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.440" end="00:47:36.190" style="s2">that these youths can be hands-free</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.890" end="00:47:40.280" style="s2">because their lives depend on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.190" end="00:47:43.820" style="s2">but one of my beefs against the news</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.280" end="00:47:47.420" style="s2">media is their addiction to gloom and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.820" end="00:47:50.750" style="s2">bad news not only harms our morale but</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.420" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">it hides from us important events 2013</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.750" end="00:47:55.910" style="s2">was the most important year for civil</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:58.520" style="s2">liberties in America in this century so</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.910" end="00:48:02.140" style="s2">far and that was when President Obama</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.520" end="00:48:04.910" style="s2">and the courts together declared a</p>

<p begin="00:48:13.480" end="00:48:20.450" style="s2">incredible importance</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.470" end="00:48:23.580" style="s2">because where else are you going to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.450" end="00:48:26.520" style="s2">more important interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.580" end="00:48:30.450" style="s2">authority than with the people with guns</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">a big difference a hell of a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.080" end="00:48:46.710" style="s2">cops out there have now decided my</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">career and maybe my life is being</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.710" end="00:48:51.570" style="s2">jeopardized by the bad apples in our</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.510" end="00:49:09.300" style="s2">thing that helps the arc is very often</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.630" end="00:49:12.510" style="s2">technology Martin Luther King would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.300" end="00:49:14.340" style="s2">gotten nowhere without the primitive TV</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.940" end="00:49:42.990" style="s2">getting people to tattle on each other</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">was shockingly good yes very good so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.609" end="00:50:04.890" style="s2">thing is that you know sure they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.150" end="00:50:28.380" style="s2">moment interesting let&#39;s get back to</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.690" end="01:16:10.530" style="s2">we talked quite a bit about the</p>

<p begin="01:16:42.930" end="01:16:47.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s no real rush right the</p>

<p begin="01:17:21.870" end="01:17:25.710" style="s2">how can we take precautions against</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.120" end="01:17:27.480" style="s2">something or for which there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.710" end="01:17:29.900" style="s2">example well that&#39;s what NASA does</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.480" end="01:17:32.970" style="s2">through the planetary protection</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.900" end="01:17:35.190" style="s2">where we make extra effort and go to</p>

<p begin="01:17:35.190" end="01:17:39.540" style="s2">spacecraft so they won&#39;t contaminate</p>

<p begin="01:17:39.540" end="01:17:46.710" style="s2">samples back from other planets we do 20</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.080" end="01:17:51.410" style="s2">times as much effort to keep the samples</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.710" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">sealed so you can take precautions</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.410" end="01:17:57.480" style="s2">without bringing science to a standstill</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the basic point fortunately it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.480" end="01:18:02.010" style="s2">have to bring science to a standstill</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:03.720" style="s2">SETI can still do its thing right and</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.010" end="01:18:06.390" style="s2">some interesting developments in SETI in</p>

<p begin="01:18:06.390" end="01:18:11.640" style="s2">and I did read your 1983 paper and I was</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.270" end="01:18:14.910" style="s2">actually very impressed with the quality</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.640" end="01:18:16.650" style="s2">of the analysis and you actually called</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.910" end="01:18:18.420" style="s2">the fact that you believed there would</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.650" end="01:18:20.820" style="s2">be a significant number of planets</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.420" end="01:18:23.070" style="s2">around smaller stars and that has indeed</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.820" end="01:18:24.930" style="s2">been confirmed so we know that and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.070" end="01:18:28.080" style="s2">other one that&#39;s quite interesting on</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.930" end="01:18:30.390" style="s2">the SETI&#39;s story is the ever growing</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.080" end="01:18:32.670" style="s2">number of extremophiles we&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.390" end="01:18:35.610" style="s2">forms of life that don&#39;t need oxygen</p>

<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:42.780" style="s2">acid etc which opens up quite</p>

<p begin="01:18:42.780" end="01:18:46.740" style="s2">which life could have evolved and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.580" end="01:18:49.590" style="s2">might include you know the moons of</p>

<p begin="01:18:49.590" end="01:18:54.150" style="s2">planets and then and that&#39;s what we know</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.870" end="01:18:56.130" style="s2">today we have extremophiles we have lots</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.150" end="01:18:58.830" style="s2">of planets in the universe and we may</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.130" end="01:19:01.620" style="s2">find two more very important things one</p>

<p begin="01:19:12.450" end="01:19:16.740" style="s2">still a huge one right maybe it&#39;s damn</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.250" end="01:19:18.120" style="s2">near impossible but if we find a second</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.740" end="01:19:20.490" style="s2">one we know it&#39;s not damn near</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.120" end="01:19:22.530" style="s2">impossible and then the next one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.490" end="01:19:25.380" style="s2">gonna get within 20 years probably less</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.530" end="01:19:28.890" style="s2">is these atmospheric surveys of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.380" end="01:19:32.520" style="s2">exoplanets we start finding exoplanets</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.890" end="01:19:34.290" style="s2">that have both oxygen and methane within</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.520" end="01:19:36.390" style="s2">prescribed ratios it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.290" end="01:19:39.900" style="s2">pretty hard to come up with a story on</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.390" end="01:19:40.920" style="s2">how those gas mixtures occurred without</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.900" end="01:19:43.860" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.920" end="01:19:45.929" style="s2">life and again that&#39;s going to you know</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.310" end="01:19:53.340" style="s2">so we could still do great science in</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.100" end="01:19:55.800" style="s2">traditional Medi by just staying the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.340" end="01:19:57.630" style="s2">course and frankly very substantially</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.800" end="01:19:59.550" style="s2">upping the expenditure you know as I was</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.630" end="01:20:02.100" style="s2">talking to Jill I was just astounded by</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.550" end="01:20:04.500" style="s2">how little money goes into into SETI</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.100" end="01:20:07.460" style="s2">when it&#39;s the second biggest question in</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.500" end="01:20:10.410" style="s2">science you may ask what&#39;s the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.460" end="01:20:12.120" style="s2">and I say why do we have the universe</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.410" end="01:20:14.190" style="s2">that we have or any universe at all</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.120" end="01:20:17.340" style="s2">that&#39;s the biggest question the second</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.190" end="01:20:18.989" style="s2">biggest is are we alone well I I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.340" end="01:20:22.830" style="s2">going to quibble with anybody as</p>

<p begin="01:20:22.830" end="01:20:28.410" style="s2">would have a close third and that is are</p>
