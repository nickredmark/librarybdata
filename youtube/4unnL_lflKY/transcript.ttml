<p begin="00:00:02.399" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">Jim rut show listeners have asked us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">provide pointers some of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:18.720" style="s2">we talked about on the show we now have</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">links to books and articles referenced</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.720" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">in recent podcasts that are available on</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">our website</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:29.660" style="s2">we also offer full transcripts go to Jim</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">rut show.com that&#39;s Jim ruts show com</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.660" end="00:00:34.620" style="s2">today&#39;s guest is brett weinstein an</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">evolutionary biologist and an acute</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.620" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">thinker about the future of humanity hey</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:42.450" style="s2">Jim great to be here thanks for having</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">me off ah great to have you out probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.450" end="00:00:46.289" style="s2">although don&#39;t know this but Brett and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">go back quite a ways what - about 2012</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">something like that yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">about right yeah well we worked on</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">something called the Emancipation Party</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">and then that became something called</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:59.100" style="s2">Game B and we r and all kinds of funky</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">problems and actually Brett summed up I</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.100" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">think is better than anybody why we did</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">not succeed in that path at that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">and I still repeat this from time to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">time Brett said ah we have too many</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">Thomas Jefferson&#39;s and not enough Ben</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">Franklin I didn&#39;t say that I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">forgotten but yes that was exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">the point it was to pinheaded but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">game B is making a return these days and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:25.020" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about it later but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">from Brett&#39;s website I took the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.020" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">following I&#39;m gonna read it and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">gonna ask Brett to talk about it if</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:35.369" style="s2">humanity continues down our current path</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">we will not survive there are too many</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.369" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">of us consuming too much our technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">is too powerful we&#39;re all hooked</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.579" style="s2">together in one global system our fates</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">are now linked and we will thrive or</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.579" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">perish together we got into this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:50.970" style="s2">predicament through an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">process all the problems that we face</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.970" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">are actually symptoms of a process that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">has no name before we talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">might be done about it could you start</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">by describing the evolutionary and game</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">theoretic dynamics that have brought us</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">to where we are today sure have you got</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">a couple weeks yeah it&#39;s one thing I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">here I go deep don&#39;t be afraid doc go</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.170" style="s2">deep yeah I&#39;m not afraid to go deep the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:16.230" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.170" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">one of layers and you know we can do a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.230" end="00:02:20.280" style="s2">short version of this which is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:22.200" style="s2">much what will be held to and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.280" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">could spend a lot of time getting into</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.200" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">the nuances I give the five minute</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">version sure so more or less our problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:34.770" style="s2">is that the magic of humans arose</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:38.819" style="s2">through an evolutionary process driven</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.770" end="00:02:42.569" style="s2">by an arms race in which human beings</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.819" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">were their own worst competitor so at</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.569" end="00:02:48.750" style="s2">that point that one reaches what my PhD</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:53.180" style="s2">advisor called ecological dominance that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.750" end="00:02:56.040" style="s2">arms race causes a massive jump in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.180" end="00:02:58.650" style="s2">essentially computing power and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.040" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">computing power came along with all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.650" end="00:03:05.819" style="s2">our best and worst characteristics so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">resulted in a spectacular capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.819" end="00:03:11.549" style="s2">collaboration but the objective of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:13.769" style="s2">collaboration is increased competitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">capacity against other groups with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.769" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">similar powers now I don&#39;t think we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">spend too much time worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">whether or not that was a good process</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:26.690" style="s2">it got us this far and it has given us</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:31.380" style="s2">the capacity to understand where we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.690" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">but what it has done is it has created a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.380" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">drive that is now outstripping</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">our capacity to compensate for its</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.350" end="00:03:44.160" style="s2">consequences so that quote you read from</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:47.010" style="s2">my website essentially is about what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.160" end="00:03:50.160" style="s2">would call a sustainability crisis now</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.010" end="00:03:52.290" style="s2">conservatives often hear when a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.160" end="00:03:54.390" style="s2">like myself starts talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.290" end="00:03:56.910" style="s2">sustainability they assume that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.390" end="00:03:59.670" style="s2">cryptically talking about climate about</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.910" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">which there is much disagreement in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.670" end="00:04:03.480" style="s2">circles I&#39;m not talking in particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">about climate I do think we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.480" end="00:04:08.819" style="s2">climate problem but even if it were</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:11.420" style="s2">false we still have a sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.819" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">problem in which we are simply using</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.420" end="00:04:17.100" style="s2">resources and creating waste in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:19.950" style="s2">that simply mathematically cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.100" end="00:04:21.330" style="s2">continue indefinitely so you have to at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.950" end="00:04:23.700" style="s2">least be a cornucopia</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.330" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">to imagine that the problems we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.700" end="00:04:29.070" style="s2">creating will be dealt with in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:31.200" style="s2">do course buy solutions that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.070" end="00:04:32.910" style="s2">magically emerge I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.200" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">reasonable to be a cornucopia</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.910" end="00:04:36.780" style="s2">but you would have to at least make that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:38.310" style="s2">jump and say well yes we&#39;re we to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.780" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">continue down this road we&#39;d be in big</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.310" end="00:04:41.700" style="s2">trouble but we all know that solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">our eyes when they&#39;re needed so if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that then you would end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.060" style="s2">in my camp and what I know from</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:50.010" style="s2">experience to be your camp thinking oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.060" end="00:04:53.070" style="s2"> we&#39;ve got a very serious problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.010" end="00:04:54.690" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.070" end="00:04:57.090" style="s2">horizon with respect to figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.690" end="00:04:59.370" style="s2">what the solution looks like yep I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.090" end="00:05:01.650" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good short summary in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.370" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">you know to the point of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.650" end="00:05:06.390" style="s2">it certainly seems to me that we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:07.500" style="s2">approaching the cliff and we may act it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.390" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">we may have actually have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.500" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">hitting the brakes hard enough to not go</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:13.320" style="s2">over the cliff to dadums that I come up</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:15.630" style="s2">with recently you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.320" end="00:05:19.350" style="s2">underscore the seriousness of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.630" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">situation half of the mass of all large</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.350" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">mammals on earth are now humans and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:27.660" style="s2">even greater than humans is our domestic</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:29.490" style="s2">animals most of it cattle that&#39;s half of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.660" end="00:05:32.760" style="s2">the mass of all large mammals on earth</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.490" end="00:05:36.660" style="s2">or humans and their domestic animals</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.760" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">mostly cattle and 70 to 80 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.660" end="00:05:41.940" style="s2">the mass of all birds not just large</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">birds on earth are our domesticated fowl</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.940" end="00:05:47.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s today with only but maybe 15%</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">of the world living the advanced Western</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.390" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">standard of living I think those two</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:55.520" style="s2">data alone tell us that we are at or</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">probably over the ability of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.520" end="00:06:01.140" style="s2">ecosystem to carry on the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:03.810" style="s2">carrying on absolutely and in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.140" end="00:06:06.450" style="s2">huge fraction of the protein that exists</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.810" end="00:06:10.200" style="s2">in us and our domesticated creatures is</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.450" end="00:06:12.660" style="s2">actually not even natively biological it</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.200" end="00:06:14.970" style="s2">is a product of nitrogen that has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.660" end="00:06:17.880" style="s2">brought into the bio biological cycles</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.970" end="00:06:19.770" style="s2">by the haber-bosch process which uses</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.880" end="00:06:22.220" style="s2">fossil fuels to take atmospheric</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.770" end="00:06:24.600" style="s2">nitrogen and turn it into biotic lis</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.220" end="00:06:26.669" style="s2">available nitrogen so in some sense we</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.600" end="00:06:28.470" style="s2">have chemically to stabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.669" end="00:06:31.080" style="s2">equilibria that would ordinarily have</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.470" end="00:06:34.680" style="s2">held us to a much smaller population</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">with many fewer voracious creatures in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.680" end="00:06:39.300" style="s2">tow but we&#39;ve just simply unhooked it</p>

<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:28.409" style="s2">but I also think it is worth pointing</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.970" end="00:07:30.840" style="s2">out that at the moment that the</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.500" end="00:07:52.590" style="s2">discovered that they can make crops grow</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.900" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">more efficiently by using energy that is</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.810" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">seemed like a god set especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.469" end="00:08:07.949" style="s2">were compassionate and you thought about</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.949" end="00:08:11.610" style="s2">enough to eat this must have seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.630" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">the solution to a problem not the mother</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.610" end="00:08:17.400" style="s2">of all problems and yet down the road we</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">find that that process has unleashed a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.400" end="00:08:23.490" style="s2">set of patterns that we now not only do</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:24.690" style="s2">we not know what to do about them we</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.490" end="00:08:26.789" style="s2">don&#39;t even know how to think about them</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.690" end="00:08:29.669" style="s2">yeah and certainly and as you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.789" end="00:08:31.500" style="s2">out in previous work we did not evolve</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.500" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">know most of our evolution was completed</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:38.459" style="s2">by 12,000 years ago before the first</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">small town was invented or settled</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.459" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">agriculture so we are not tuned to think</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:09.800" style="s2">in fact I&#39;ll I&#39;ll go one step further</p>

<p begin="00:09:13.640" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">now we have set ourselves a new level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.420" end="00:09:25.750" style="s2">problem that indeed is unlike any past</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:29.720" style="s2">analog however what we have on board our</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.700" end="00:09:37.400" style="s2">of the ancestors has run out and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.250" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">are certainly in an extreme version of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.400" end="00:09:42.110" style="s2">that problem but if there&#39;s one creature</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">that is built to address that sort of</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.290" end="00:09:53.810" style="s2">think of as the engine that is driving</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:56.029" style="s2">this late pursuit of the edge if we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.810" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">to call it that the ecocide and now</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.029" end="00:10:00.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me say this before it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.620" end="00:10:05.060" style="s2">by psychologically astute advertising</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.020" end="00:10:07.580" style="s2">that really got underway in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.060" end="00:10:09.589" style="s2">and now reaching its near perfection</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.580" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">with the highly instrumented attention</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.070" end="00:10:23.690" style="s2">is now turned into the paperclip</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">absolutely agree with this what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.780" end="00:10:36.770" style="s2">said elsewhere is that the AI apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">is already upon us but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.770" end="00:10:41.060" style="s2">recognize it because we were expecting</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:19.780" style="s2">before that people in business at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.270" end="00:16:22.810" style="s2">a fair number of them weren&#39;t money on</p>

<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:35.500" style="s2">meeting we sat down and talked for about</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.730" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">four hours I realized that we saw the</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:41.710" style="s2">we met and I was laying this out that</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.710" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">the people that ran even publicly traded</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.960" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">companies often would not do things that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.270" end="00:16:51.700" style="s2">would be profitable if they thought they</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:54.520" style="s2">were wrong but by the 90s the ethos had</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.700" end="00:16:57.280" style="s2">changed to be if something was arguably</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.520" end="00:16:59.230" style="s2">legal and profitable not only should you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.280" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">do it but perhaps you had a legal duty</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.230" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">to do it right there was no sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:07.060" style="s2">what was honorable what was honest or</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:08.920" style="s2">what was good and I think if we say</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.780" end="00:17:39.420" style="s2">million dollars and they probably made</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.370" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">money on it so anyway a system where</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.669" end="00:18:02.179" style="s2">I&#39;d say in my experience probably 10% by</p>

<p begin="00:18:02.179" end="00:18:07.720" style="s2">sociopaths and maybe 30% the higher</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.179" end="00:18:11.539" style="s2">levels of Finance and that compares to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.720" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">1% or so in the general population so it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.539" end="00:18:15.590" style="s2">strikes me that not only do we have an</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:18.049" style="s2">algorithmic problem but relatively</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.590" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">recently we have a have had a breakdown</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.130" end="00:18:39.100" style="s2">but what happened is not a breakdown it</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.179" end="00:18:42.260" style="s2">is an evolutionary trajectory that was</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.620" end="00:18:56.360" style="s2">acceptable but we&#39;re legal maybe not</p>

<p begin="00:19:44.840" end="00:19:51.500" style="s2">1975 there was a social ethos that most</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.500" end="00:19:56.090" style="s2">there was an ability socially to resist</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.350" end="00:20:16.340" style="s2">you know this would have been policed</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.120" end="00:20:19.029" style="s2">maybe at the Country Club rather than in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.340" end="00:20:21.289" style="s2">a court but what happened was</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.029" end="00:20:22.970" style="s2">globalization caused a circumstance</p>

<p begin="00:20:24.679" end="00:20:29.620" style="s2">you were in a much bigger pool and</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.130" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">you know I would say we should look back</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.750" end="00:21:20.899" style="s2">wired to fight back and the question I</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.330" end="00:21:24.289" style="s2">mean really to me there is almost one</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.899" end="00:21:27.289" style="s2">question the question is those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.289" end="00:21:30.289" style="s2">understand that we must fight back can</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.289" end="00:21:32.659" style="s2">we engineer a system that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.289" end="00:21:35.299" style="s2">opt out of the things that are so toxic</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.659" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">without being competitively overrun by</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.299" end="00:21:39.860" style="s2">those who refuse to opt out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:43.640" style="s2">really the game beat question as I see</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.860" end="00:21:47.750" style="s2">it that is one approach to game B which</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.640" end="00:21:50.179" style="s2">is the withdraw and parasitize game a</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.750" end="00:21:51.860" style="s2">while not taking the toxins in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.179" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">the other alternative called the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.860" end="00:21:57.799" style="s2">emancipation party alternative is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">historically the way that markets have</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.799" end="00:22:01.580" style="s2">been limited so that they were good for</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.529" style="s2">humanity and not run amok has been</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.580" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">through governance and so the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.529" end="00:22:08.929" style="s2">alternative is to for the humans to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:11.090" style="s2">finally wake up and seize control of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:12.500" style="s2">their governance and use the market</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.090" end="00:22:14.990" style="s2">which is one of the greatest inventions</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.500" end="00:22:16.910" style="s2">of humans of all time but</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.990" end="00:22:19.309" style="s2">use it in a way that it&#39;s like a fire in</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.910" end="00:22:21.620" style="s2">your wood stove not a fire burning down</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.309" end="00:22:23.179" style="s2">your house I think so roads are possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.620" end="00:22:26.360" style="s2">but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.179" end="00:22:32.150" style="s2">roads I think that&#39;s one road the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.360" end="00:22:34.760" style="s2">is we have to utilize markets as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.150" end="00:22:36.679" style="s2">to forge the new system you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.760" end="00:22:38.330" style="s2">to get there any other way even modes</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.679" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">that might once have worked like</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.330" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">revolution are implausible they would</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:46.070" style="s2">create far more destruction at this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">moment in history so we have to use</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.070" end="00:22:51.320" style="s2">something like markets and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:53.210" style="s2">use governance to structure those</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.320" end="00:22:55.990" style="s2">markets so that they return an answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.210" end="00:22:58.790" style="s2">that is viable rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.990" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">self-destructive now the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.790" end="00:23:05.780" style="s2">you do that and the answer the game be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:08.090" style="s2">answer has to be through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.780" end="00:23:11.210" style="s2">exploitation of mechanisms that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.090" end="00:23:14.120" style="s2">competitively superior to the parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.210" end="00:23:18.550" style="s2">mechanisms that we face and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.120" end="00:23:21.050" style="s2">spread naturally through competition so</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.550" end="00:23:24.679" style="s2">you know we can talk and we probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.050" end="00:23:29.780" style="s2">should talk about what game B is and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.679" end="00:23:32.179" style="s2">isn&#39;t but I think baseline it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.780" end="00:23:34.300" style="s2">the idea that we are in search of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.179" end="00:23:37.309" style="s2">solution that solves these problems</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.300" end="00:23:40.390" style="s2">without any of the failure modes that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.309" end="00:23:42.800" style="s2">would accompany solutions of the past</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.390" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">yeah I think that is at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.800" end="00:23:47.450" style="s2">level a good description and does and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.490" style="s2">would add with the caveat that it does</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.450" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">so in time that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.490" end="00:23:53.900" style="s2">disastrous crash when we reach the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:57.230" style="s2">limits of our ecosystem which appear to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.900" end="00:23:59.780" style="s2">be no longer than 80 years from now at</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.230" end="00:24:02.150" style="s2">the most at the most and it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.780" end="00:24:03.470" style="s2">lot less and I&#39;ll point out relative to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.150" end="00:24:05.690" style="s2">something you said at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.470" end="00:24:09.950" style="s2">the conversation one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.690" end="00:24:13.429" style="s2">I fear is that we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.950" end="00:24:16.130" style="s2">systems that are so complex that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.429" end="00:24:19.340" style="s2">thresholds beyond which there is no</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.130" end="00:24:21.620" style="s2">plausible return probably will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.340" end="00:24:24.620" style="s2">crossed without anybody knowing that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.620" end="00:24:26.030" style="s2">has happened so for people who are used</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.620" end="00:24:28.730" style="s2">to dealing with the kinds of systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.030" end="00:24:32.360" style="s2">that shudder before they</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.730" end="00:24:36.230" style="s2">break apart who maybe thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.360" end="00:24:37.910" style="s2">things are relatively alright based on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.230" end="00:24:40.760" style="s2">kind of Steven Pinker sort of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.910" end="00:24:43.550" style="s2">about where we are are going to lead us</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.760" end="00:24:46.610" style="s2">into ever greater danger because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.550" end="00:24:50.360" style="s2">thresholds that must not be crossed will</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.610" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">be invisible until it&#39;s far too late yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.360" end="00:24:54.800" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a hugely important point</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">for us all to be cognizant about you</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.800" end="00:24:59.180" style="s2">know bread as you know I&#39;ve been a</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.180" end="00:25:04.850" style="s2">the last eighteen years and frankly the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.870" end="00:25:06.650" style="s2">biggest takeaway from studying</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.850" end="00:25:10.370" style="s2">complexity is what I would describe is</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.650" end="00:25:12.470" style="s2">epistemological modesty we know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.370" end="00:25:14.950" style="s2">less than we think we know about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.470" end="00:25:17.300" style="s2">going to happen in a complex system and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.950" end="00:25:19.010" style="s2">essentially every system that&#39;s at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.300" end="00:25:21.650" style="s2">interesting with respect to human</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.010" end="00:25:25.490" style="s2">affairs today is indeed a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.650" end="00:25:30.340" style="s2">yes a complex system but I would point</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.490" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">out that the fantastic difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.340" end="00:25:37.970" style="s2">comprehending these things is the flip</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:41.510" style="s2">side of the simplicity of the basic</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.970" end="00:25:42.860" style="s2">principles that run them and so to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.510" end="00:25:45.050" style="s2">extent that one looks at a biological</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.860" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">organism for example and thinks oh my</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.050" end="00:25:52.580" style="s2">goodness I mean even just a diagram of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:55.070" style="s2">the known metabolic pathways is almost</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.580" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">beyond human comprehension</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.070" end="00:26:01.070" style="s2">on the other hand this thing springs</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:04.340" style="s2">into being automatically itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.070" end="00:26:06.620" style="s2">assembles it maintains itself it repairs</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.340" end="00:26:09.560" style="s2">itself it defends itself all starting</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.620" end="00:26:11.900" style="s2">from a single cell in which the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.560" end="00:26:15.680" style="s2">instruction set is written in a code of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.900" end="00:26:19.400" style="s2">four letters so the point is that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.680" end="00:26:21.380" style="s2">thing is so darn elegant that we ought</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.400" end="00:26:23.300" style="s2">to be thinking in these terms with</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.380" end="00:26:25.370" style="s2">respect to how civilization should run</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.300" end="00:26:28.190" style="s2">in other words we should not we must not</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.370" end="00:26:31.280" style="s2">be imagining a highly complicated</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.190" end="00:26:32.870" style="s2">governance structure to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.280" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">well-being of people that will turn into</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.870" end="00:26:38.540" style="s2">a nightmare what we need is a highly</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:42.600" style="s2">elegant governance structure that does</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.540" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">the heavy lifting of modulating</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.600" end="00:26:47.070" style="s2">civilization that is that exists at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.690" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">level of complexity that we will never</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.070" end="00:26:51.480" style="s2">fully comprehend what&#39;s going on I think</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.480" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">say the other takeaway from complexity</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.130" end="00:26:59.220" style="s2">science is it appears to be in principle</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:27:01.289" style="s2">impossible to accurately determine the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.220" end="00:27:03.899" style="s2">Emergencies that you will actually get</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.289" end="00:27:05.580" style="s2">from the simple underpinnings you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.899" end="00:27:10.350" style="s2">of a complex system so we could design</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.350" end="00:27:14.370" style="s2">but the actual result I would argue is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.080" end="00:27:16.260" style="s2">unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.370" end="00:27:18.630" style="s2">which leads me to believe we should not</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:42.389" style="s2">need but we are smart enough to navigate</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.389" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">but we have to do is take a good guess</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:34.190" style="s2">economics we just don&#39;t know how to map</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.890" end="00:29:35.630" style="s2">them yet so one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.190" end="00:29:38.140" style="s2">discovered when I was doing my</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.630" end="00:29:40.940" style="s2">dissertation work which ended up being a</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.940" end="00:29:45.740" style="s2">and the rules that govern them was that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.890" end="00:29:48.620" style="s2">there were certain systems that I knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.740" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">well enough that I could peer into them</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.620" end="00:29:53.510" style="s2">and see how trade-offs worked and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:55.070" style="s2">back up and try to look into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.510" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">biological system and find the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.070" end="00:30:02.090" style="s2">sorts of properties so for example I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:03.890" style="s2">a photographer fairly serious about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.090" end="00:30:06.860" style="s2">for a while and the kinds of trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:09.650" style="s2">that one encounters with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.860" end="00:30:13.430" style="s2">having a given number of photons</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.650" end="00:30:17.150" style="s2">incident on the lens that then can be</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.580" end="00:30:23.780" style="s2">with a small aperture that those</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.410" end="00:30:26.810" style="s2">trade-offs mirror the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.780" end="00:30:29.390" style="s2">that we see in nature with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.810" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">for example the wing shape</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:37.700" style="s2">birds and bats and so the key insight of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.910" end="00:30:41.450" style="s2">my dissertation was that the trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.700" end="00:30:44.060" style="s2">were not one-off phenomena that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.450" end="00:30:46.100" style="s2">every two desirable characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.060" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">existed in the same mechanism or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.100" end="00:30:50.840" style="s2">same organism had a trade-off function</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">that related them and that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.840" end="00:30:54.980" style="s2">that we did not Intuit this in biology</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:58.100" style="s2">is that many of those trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.980" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">functions have a bargain at one end and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.100" end="00:31:02.630" style="s2">so we don&#39;t see any diversity at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:03.020" style="s2">along the trade-off because creatures</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.630" end="00:31:04.700" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.020" end="00:31:07.370" style="s2">press anything other than the bargain</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.700" end="00:31:11.060" style="s2">condition are eliminated competitively</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.370" end="00:31:12.440" style="s2">and so we see one state in nature and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.060" end="00:31:14.090" style="s2">do not into it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.440" end="00:31:15.940" style="s2">the fact that the function is more</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.090" end="00:31:18.650" style="s2">complex than that but there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.940" end="00:31:22.060" style="s2">circumstances in evolution that will</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.650" end="00:31:25.520" style="s2">reveal other parts of a trade off and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.060" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s really the game that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.520" end="00:31:32.210" style="s2">caught in we&#39;re caught in a game in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:34.520" style="s2">which we see a desire to improve things</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.210" end="00:31:35.780" style="s2">and we view evolution traditionally we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.520" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">have viewed it as an engine of</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.780" end="00:31:42.230" style="s2">improvement but a sophisticated player</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:46.280" style="s2">in the space recognizes that improvement</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.230" end="00:31:49.490" style="s2">quickly exhausts itself as a cost free</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.280" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">or nearly cost free pursuit and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.490" end="00:31:54.410" style="s2">ultimately the game one ends up playing</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:57.620" style="s2">is one of balancing competing concerns</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.400" end="00:32:12.920" style="s2">one is in evolutionary computing where</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.940" end="00:32:15.710" style="s2">we essentially create software by</p>

<p begin="00:33:45.049" end="00:33:49.940" style="s2">well after reading his economics he and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.809" end="00:33:52.759" style="s2">I started having a series of discussions</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.940" end="00:33:55.789" style="s2">and we actually talked for four hours</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.759" end="00:33:59.450" style="s2">with me arguing against Daniel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.789" end="00:34:01.580" style="s2">hypothesis that a game B economics would</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.450" end="00:34:05.809" style="s2">eliminate trade-offs that struck me is</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.580" end="00:34:07.490" style="s2">just entirely implausible yeah it well</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.809" end="00:34:09.490" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way Daniel is a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.490" end="00:34:13.940" style="s2">smart guy I know him pretty well as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.490" end="00:34:16.609" style="s2">he might mean something by that that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.940" end="00:34:19.220" style="s2">recoverable but as stated there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.609" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">conceivable way it can be true now what</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.220" end="00:34:24.169" style="s2">you can do and what you will see</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:28.550" style="s2">creatures do all the time is they will</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.169" end="00:34:32.000" style="s2">innovate a mechanism to spectacularly</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.550" end="00:34:35.149" style="s2">reduce the cost of some trade-off but</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.000" end="00:34:37.700" style="s2">when they do this what happens is they</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.149" end="00:34:39.260" style="s2">temporarily become what we would call a</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.700" end="00:34:42.440" style="s2">super species that is to say a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.260" end="00:34:44.780" style="s2">competitor that&#39;s simply ahead of all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.440" end="00:34:46.609" style="s2">the others with which it is competing</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.780" end="00:34:50.179" style="s2">and then at the point that it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.609" end="00:34:53.179" style="s2">eliminated those competitors it will</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.179" end="00:34:55.700" style="s2">diversify but all of the descendants</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.179" end="00:34:57.770" style="s2">will have the innovation that allowed it</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.700" end="00:34:59.480" style="s2">to exceed some prior trade-off so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.770" end="00:35:01.760" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s very much like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.480" end="00:35:04.550" style="s2">situation that you were describing a few</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.760" end="00:35:06.680" style="s2">minutes ago with respect to evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.550" end="00:35:09.170" style="s2">computer algorithms where you find that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.680" end="00:35:11.030" style="s2">there are frontiers and you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">at the frontier you don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.030" end="00:35:15.050" style="s2">suboptimal and be below the frontier you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.960" style="s2">want to be in the optimality</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.050" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">zone but what there are are frontiers</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.960" end="00:35:25.240" style="s2">stacked on frontiers and then ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:27.890" style="s2">the laws of physics or chemistry will</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.240" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">provide a limit that cannot be exceeded</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.890" end="00:35:30.710" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">for example if we think about minimizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.710" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">surface-to-volume ratio you get to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:39.079" style="s2">sphere and there&#39;s nowhere to go so</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.940" style="s2">nature many times has minimized surface</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.079" end="00:35:44.299" style="s2">to volume ratios for various reasons</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.940" end="00:35:47.180" style="s2">like minimizing the radiation of heat</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.299" end="00:35:49.490" style="s2">for example and it will come up with</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.180" end="00:35:52.609" style="s2">something spiracle and we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.490" end="00:35:54.410" style="s2">expecting a next innovation because</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.609" end="00:35:55.930" style="s2">geometrically there&#39;s nowhere to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.410" end="00:35:58.579" style="s2">whereas if you go the other direction</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.930" end="00:36:00.049" style="s2">let&#39;s say you were trying to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.579" end="00:36:02.329" style="s2">surface to volume ratio there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.049" end="00:36:04.849" style="s2">kinds of literal convolutions you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.329" end="00:36:06.950" style="s2">add to a structure in order to increase</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.849" end="00:36:09.799" style="s2">the rate of contact it has with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.950" end="00:36:12.049" style="s2">environment or neighbors and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.799" end="00:36:15.049" style="s2">all sorts of room for evolution to take</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.049" end="00:36:16.849" style="s2">place so I don&#39;t exactly know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.049" end="00:36:18.920" style="s2">Daniel might be getting at with respect</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.849" end="00:36:21.369" style="s2">to eliminating trade-offs you may be</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.920" end="00:36:25.339" style="s2">saying something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.369" end="00:36:27.109" style="s2">eliminating perceived trade-offs I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.339" end="00:36:28.940" style="s2">to go back at it but in four hours I</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.109" end="00:36:30.650" style="s2">couldn&#39;t he couldn&#39;t convince me and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.940" end="00:36:32.930" style="s2">couldn&#39;t convince him so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.650" end="00:36:34.970" style="s2">some work we need to do but I&#39;m with you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.930" end="00:36:36.910" style="s2">that I believe that trade-offs are</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.970" end="00:36:40.009" style="s2">fundamental to the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.910" end="00:36:41.480" style="s2">right I&#39;m a certain of that as I am of</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.009" end="00:36:43.190" style="s2">my own name ah</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.480" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">so I think we&#39;re on the same page as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.190" end="00:36:47.539" style="s2">say Daniel is a very smart and good</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:49.160" style="s2">faith guy and it may well may be that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.539" end="00:36:50.869" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to communicate something I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.160" end="00:36:53.569" style="s2">was just too dense to get it so I will</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.869" end="00:36:55.430" style="s2">touch back in with him and see see if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.569" end="00:36:57.019" style="s2">can make sense of this I wanna I want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.430" end="00:36:59.269" style="s2">pause you there for one second I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.019" end="00:37:02.089" style="s2">think it&#39;s a question of anybody being</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.269" end="00:37:04.309" style="s2">dense I think it&#39;s it&#39;s something else I</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.089" end="00:37:08.509" style="s2">have seen this now many times which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.309" end="00:37:09.849" style="s2">you&#39;ve got fields which get stuck I</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.509" end="00:37:12.829" style="s2">would argue that they get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.849" end="00:37:15.170" style="s2">regularly and for evolutionary reasons</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.829" end="00:37:17.960" style="s2">but once they are stuck you&#39;re left with</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.170" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">everybody inside the field thinking the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.960" end="00:37:23.450" style="s2">same incorrect thoughts and then people</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:25.069" style="s2">on the outside trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.450" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">to break through the deadlock</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.069" end="00:37:29.509" style="s2">what the people on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:32.900" style="s2">inevitably end up having to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.509" end="00:37:36.829" style="s2">to break through deadlocks is they end</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.900" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">up inventing their own language in other</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.829" end="00:37:40.549" style="s2">words the language that they are handed</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:42.470" style="s2">isn&#39;t good enough to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.549" end="00:37:44.990" style="s2">so they end up redefining terms</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.470" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">and unfortunately for most of the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.990" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">who do this they forget that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:51.619" style="s2">done it the language becomes so native</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:54.290" style="s2">to them that when they talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.619" end="00:37:57.380" style="s2">else they are using a language that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.290" end="00:37:59.180" style="s2">been partially personalised and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.380" end="00:38:00.500" style="s2">person they&#39;re speaking to imagine us</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.180" end="00:38:02.349" style="s2">that they&#39;re speaking gobbledygook</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.500" end="00:38:04.790" style="s2">because the way they&#39;re using terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.349" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t add up in a standard framework</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.790" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">and so my best guess would be that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:15.170" style="s2">know Daniel being the way he is he is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:17.240" style="s2">most certainly redefined some things in</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.170" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">order for him to do productive work and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.240" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">forgotten how those things if he uses</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:25.369" style="s2">those terms without clarifying them how</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:28.130" style="s2">they get heard by others and we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.369" end="00:38:29.180" style="s2">this before and unfortunately I always</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.130" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">thought that people are gonna do this</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.180" end="00:38:33.290" style="s2">they ought to have a personal glossary</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:35.660" style="s2">online so that when you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.290" end="00:38:37.550" style="s2">Daniel or you know Jordan or somebody</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.660" end="00:38:40.369" style="s2">you know that when they say X they</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.550" end="00:38:42.410" style="s2">actually mean Y at least in mapping it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.369" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">back to standard English a glossary is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.410" end="00:38:47.869" style="s2">good idea and I&#39;ve toyed with the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:51.890" style="s2">idea of writing one for myself but I in</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.869" end="00:38:55.250" style="s2">practice what I&#39;ve seen happen is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.890" end="00:38:57.260" style="s2">takes a couple of weeks of interacting</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.250" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">with somebody you know if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.260" end="00:38:59.930" style="s2">know anything about the topic and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:01.070" style="s2">know something and you&#39;re teaching them</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.930" end="00:39:03.170" style="s2">if that&#39;s something you can do</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.070" end="00:39:04.430" style="s2">relatively straightforwardly of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.170" end="00:39:06.050" style="s2">they will pick up your weird Tom</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.430" end="00:39:07.880" style="s2">terminology and they won&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.050" end="00:39:11.330" style="s2">why other people don&#39;t resonate with it</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.880" end="00:39:13.790" style="s2">but if two people have done independent</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.330" end="00:39:16.190" style="s2">work and then they sit down to compare</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.790" end="00:39:19.190" style="s2">notes they will both have personal</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.190" end="00:39:23.930" style="s2">languages and it takes a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.190" end="00:39:27.260" style="s2">of discussing even relatively mundane</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.930" end="00:39:30.020" style="s2">thing is to bring out what these</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.260" end="00:39:32.060" style="s2">definitions are and what they mean what</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.020" end="00:39:35.750" style="s2">I always say when I&#39;m in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.060" end="00:39:37.790" style="s2">is look I don&#39;t need to I don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.750" end="00:39:40.400" style="s2">right to define a particular term like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.790" end="00:39:43.160" style="s2">if I&#39;ve redefined the term sympathy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.400" end="00:39:47.150" style="s2">empathy for reasons of making progress</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.160" end="00:39:50.270" style="s2">with respect to that realm I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.150" end="00:39:53.869" style="s2">the right to define those terms but I do</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.270" end="00:39:56.030" style="s2">need the right to have a term that means</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.869" end="00:39:57.890" style="s2">what I mean when I say that and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.030" end="00:39:59.150" style="s2">there we&#39;re gonna use my terms for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.890" end="00:40:00.650" style="s2">purpose of the argument or we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.150" end="00:40:03.470" style="s2">come up with some other term but what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.650" end="00:40:06.920" style="s2">can&#39;t be left with is the same blunt</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.470" end="00:40:10.330" style="s2">objects that everybody else is using I</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.920" end="00:40:12.820" style="s2">need some term to mean X and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.330" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">two people who have done this in</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.310" end="00:44:18.770" style="s2">of noise what I think we are seeing so</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:20.540" style="s2">we have two things going on</p>

<p begin="00:44:29.270" end="00:44:37.010" style="s2">communities try to self-police and on</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.530" end="00:44:38.870" style="s2">the one hand I think the instinct to</p>

<p begin="00:44:49.850" end="00:44:57.080" style="s2">really what we need is a means of taking</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.880" end="00:48:19.329" style="s2">is in general that community and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:24.099" style="s2">I now have a quarter of a million</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.329" end="00:48:26.760" style="s2">Twitter followers that community is in</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.900" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">this and there are only three or four</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:05.549" style="s2">there have only been I think it&#39;s four</p>

<p begin="00:49:17.049" end="00:49:22.750" style="s2">is of a community that is surprisingly</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.750" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">intelligent and nuanced so I know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.910" end="00:49:31.089" style="s2">that&#39;s not the general experience but</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.250" style="s2">the fact that some of us and my wife</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:33.579" style="s2">there isn&#39;t necessarily an organizing</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.740" end="00:50:48.970" style="s2">and I said yeah the open public Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.079" end="00:50:50.740" style="s2">is kind of cruddy but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.970" end="00:50:53.559" style="s2">tremendous amount of good stuff going on</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.740" end="00:50:55.630" style="s2">in groups various sorts and groups might</p>

<p begin="00:53:45.120" end="00:53:52.860" style="s2">started out earlier in life fairly far</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.930" end="00:53:56.190" style="s2">to the right and I certainly started out</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.860" end="00:53:57.870" style="s2">far to the left and I think part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.190" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">reason that I think you and I get along</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.870" end="00:54:07.500" style="s2">so well is that to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:11.160" style="s2">are radicals it&#39;s not because we want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.500" end="00:54:13.530" style="s2">be I think the point is this is a moment</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.160" end="00:54:15.690" style="s2">at which if you have understood the</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.440" end="00:54:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a last resort but the fact is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.620" end="00:54:30.810" style="s2">better than going extinct and so in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.280" end="00:54:35.340" style="s2">sense it&#39;s not an ideological position</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.810" end="00:54:40.230" style="s2">it is the only response to a crisis of a</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.670" end="00:55:06.270" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good way to put it what</p>

<p begin="00:55:06.270" end="00:55:11.160" style="s2">makes leftist think you&#39;re a right</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.310" end="00:55:14.550" style="s2">winger well it&#39;s the oddest thing but</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.160" end="00:55:17.820" style="s2">the left has a love-hate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.550" end="00:55:20.790" style="s2">with Darwinism and this is long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.820" end="00:55:24.540" style="s2">I think this is because on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.790" end="00:55:28.700" style="s2">the left is traditionally the keepers of</p>

<p begin="00:55:45.869" end="00:55:53.250" style="s2">uncomfortable questions about what human</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.860" end="00:55:55.890" style="s2">beings are and what the meaning is of</p>

<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:09.660" style="s2">on the left effectively trying to</p>

<p begin="00:56:09.660" end="00:56:14.760" style="s2">becomes with respect to humans and in</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.510" end="00:56:18.210" style="s2">fact much to my shock</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.760" end="00:56:21.450" style="s2">I heard Richard Dawkins arguing against</p>

<p begin="00:56:21.450" end="00:56:27.869" style="s2">history when I met with him on stage in</p>

<p begin="00:56:27.869" end="00:56:34.710" style="s2">long-standing concern now my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.190" end="00:56:39.030" style="s2">having been down this road some distance</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.710" end="00:56:41.910" style="s2">is that in the end Darwinism is not a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.030" end="00:56:46.050" style="s2">universal win for the left but that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.910" end="00:56:49.830" style="s2">story that emerges from Darwinism is in</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.050" end="00:56:53.880" style="s2">the end positive for a progressive view</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.830" end="00:56:56.780" style="s2">of the world on the other hand this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.880" end="00:57:00.510" style="s2">science and irrespective of whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.780" end="00:57:03.750" style="s2">Darwinism hands a win to the left or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.510" end="00:57:06.150" style="s2">we have to go with what&#39;s true we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.750" end="00:57:09.210" style="s2">get to modulate the truth based on what</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.150" end="00:57:12.570" style="s2">we want to be right it goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.210" end="00:57:14.190" style="s2">human point about is versus odd there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.570" end="00:57:15.840" style="s2">a question of what is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.190" end="00:57:19.200" style="s2">province of science what we think about</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.840" end="00:57:21.840" style="s2">it and do about it is outside of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.200" end="00:57:24.950" style="s2">bounds and as a Darwinist I&#39;m committed</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.840" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">to figuring out what actually is</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.950" end="00:57:30.420" style="s2">irrespective of its implications but</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:33.690" style="s2">what I encounter on the Left</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.420" end="00:57:38.220" style="s2">increasingly is fear of even the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.690" end="00:57:41.310" style="s2">basic terminology that might be used to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.220" end="00:57:42.910" style="s2">understand humans so I&#39;ve gotten in</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.310" end="00:57:45.160" style="s2">trouble in</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.910" end="00:57:48.250" style="s2">political spaces for example for even</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.160" end="00:57:50.800" style="s2">invoking the term genotype or phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.250" end="00:57:52.570" style="s2">with respect to humans as if there was</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.800" end="00:57:55.180" style="s2">any controversy at all about whether</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.570" end="00:57:57.330" style="s2">these things apply you can also get in</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.180" end="00:57:59.770" style="s2">trouble these days for asserting that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.330" end="00:58:02.830" style="s2">there is some significant biological</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.770" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">difference between men and women of all</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.830" end="00:58:07.960" style="s2">things if you had told me 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:09.640" style="s2">that I would live to see a day in which</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.960" end="00:58:11.530" style="s2">there was any controversy surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.640" end="00:58:14.350" style="s2">that question at all I would have said</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.530" end="00:58:17.590" style="s2">there isn&#39;t one chance in a million but</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.350" end="00:58:19.780" style="s2">here we are yeah there does seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.590" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">lot of real wackadoodle nonsense about</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.780" end="00:58:23.560" style="s2">this gender business these days and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:24.790" style="s2">frankly just tuned it out I figure those</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.560" end="00:58:27.100" style="s2">people aren&#39;t worth talking through</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.790" end="00:58:29.290" style="s2">they&#39;re goofy sons of bitches someday</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.100" end="00:58:31.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll straighten out and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.290" end="00:58:33.940" style="s2">most of them won&#39;t reproduce so they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:36.190" style="s2">go away but I know in some areas it</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.940" end="00:58:38.110" style="s2">could be quite a pestilence actually I</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.190" end="00:58:39.910" style="s2">just try to avoid all that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.110" end="00:58:41.050" style="s2">one I have seen the trigger I will say</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.910" end="00:58:43.510" style="s2">you know I deal with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.050" end="00:58:44.860" style="s2">evolutionary theoretical biologists at</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.510" end="00:58:47.170" style="s2">the Santa Fe Institute and other</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.860" end="00:58:49.030" style="s2">scientific institutes of associated with</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.170" end="00:58:50.710" style="s2">and frankly most of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.030" end="00:58:53.619" style="s2">left wingers and I&#39;ve never seen any</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.710" end="00:58:55.770" style="s2">cognitive dissonance in them in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.619" end="00:58:58.750" style="s2">about evolutionary biology and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.770" end="00:59:00.970" style="s2">progressive politics at all but where I</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.750" end="00:59:02.619" style="s2">have seen it this is you know came as</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.970" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">quite a shock about two years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.619" end="00:59:08.590" style="s2">happen to reference a work somebody had</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:09.940" style="s2">done on something and they were someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.590" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">who traveled under the title</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.940" end="00:59:14.740" style="s2">evolutionary psychologist and talked</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:16.390" style="s2">about setting off an explosion right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.740" end="00:59:18.580" style="s2">you know to your point about Pinker it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.390" end="00:59:20.740" style="s2">it&#39;s very weird well you may disagree</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.580" end="00:59:23.619" style="s2">with any one person who flies under the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.740" end="00:59:26.440" style="s2">flag of evolutionary psychology clearly</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.619" end="00:59:27.880" style="s2">our psychology had to evolve I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.440" end="00:59:30.220" style="s2">remember who said it but one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.880" end="00:59:31.810" style="s2">famous theoretical biologist said you</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.220" end="00:59:34.690" style="s2">know nothing is knowable in biology</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.810" end="00:59:36.340" style="s2">except through the lens of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.690" end="00:59:38.590" style="s2">that certainly has to include human</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.340" end="00:59:41.530" style="s2">psychology yeah that was theodosius</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.590" end="00:59:43.240" style="s2">dobzhansky you got it nothing acting</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.530" end="00:59:47.500" style="s2">makes any sense in biology except in</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.240" end="00:59:51.010" style="s2">light of evolution yeah and really the</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.500" end="00:59:53.710" style="s2">this ought to be uncontroversial surely</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.010" end="00:59:54.299" style="s2">the burden of proof is on anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.710" end="00:59:56.509" style="s2">imagined</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.299" end="01:00:00.539" style="s2">that human psychology has some other</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.509" end="01:00:05.869" style="s2">explanation but the problem is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.539" end="01:00:08.189" style="s2">requires several weeks perhaps of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.869" end="01:00:12.359" style="s2">exploration in order for people to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.189" end="01:00:15.660" style="s2">understand that their right to determine</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.359" end="01:00:18.650" style="s2">the nature of their own existence is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.660" end="01:00:22.349" style="s2">up for debate in a discussion of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.650" end="01:00:25.410" style="s2">which created human psychology in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.349" end="01:00:29.369" style="s2">Darwinian context in other words we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.410" end="01:00:31.679" style="s2">at a moment in history where we are not</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.369" end="01:00:35.400" style="s2">fit for this current environment and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.679" end="01:00:38.999" style="s2">have to define a new path for how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.400" end="01:00:40.589" style="s2">going to interact certainly the tools</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.999" end="01:00:44.009" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t inherited through a</p>

<p begin="01:00:44.009" end="01:00:53.099" style="s2">is possible but they do not tell us who</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.099" end="01:00:58.019" style="s2">words I think what&#39;s happening is people</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.569" end="01:01:00.689" style="s2">are imagining that if you&#39;re saying that</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.489" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">the best hope we have of banishing it is</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.989" end="01:02:03.449" style="s2">in awe daily of what evolution has</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.589" end="01:02:06.390" style="s2">produced and really I&#39;m the kind of guy</p>

<p begin="01:02:21.630" end="01:02:27.599" style="s2">it is both mind-numbing and amoral we</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.470" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">have an obligation to reject what</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.599" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">evolution wants for us and to reapply</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.940" end="01:02:51.390" style="s2">out the evolutionary story you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.490" end="01:02:53.309" style="s2">choose a story that you can play out in</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.390" end="01:02:56.069" style="s2">light of the evolutionary constraints</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.309" end="01:02:57.990" style="s2">but I am certainly advocating that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.069" end="01:03:01.140" style="s2">people find something to do with their</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.140" end="01:03:06.569" style="s2">and more defensible than spreading their</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.569" end="01:03:10.920" style="s2">very well said I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna go mine the</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.920" end="01:03:13.829" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna start using your language</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.240" end="01:03:16.920" style="s2">because you said it a lot better than I</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.829" end="01:03:18.779" style="s2">did well thank you that our genes are</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.920" end="01:03:21.390" style="s2">not our destiny but guess what folks</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.779" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">they are our genes right you can&#39;t deny</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.390" end="01:03:27.930" style="s2">that when we have the the is aught</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.440" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">strikes me as the strangest mind set</p>

<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:44.309" style="s2">it&#39;s sad because in some sense I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.210" end="01:03:46.680" style="s2">maybe this is the bleeding heart liberal</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.309" end="01:03:49.500" style="s2">and me coming out but in some sense I</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.680" end="01:03:51.660" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the people you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.500" end="01:03:54.390" style="s2">there are bad actors in the group that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.660" end="01:03:57.509" style="s2">are making trouble on these lines but</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.390" end="01:03:59.400" style="s2">most of the people who are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.509" end="01:04:02.210" style="s2">prevent us from having a proper</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.450" end="01:04:17.970" style="s2">is there and what they need in fact what</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.720" end="01:04:20.760" style="s2">I believe they are entitled to is a</p>

<p begin="01:04:29.760" end="01:04:38.370" style="s2">is I mean the fact is our genes gave us</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.620" end="01:04:40.260" style="s2">more freedom from genetic destiny than</p>

<p begin="01:04:40.260" end="01:04:46.050" style="s2">on earth that&#39;s really the punchline to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.560" end="01:04:48.360" style="s2">the evolutionary story is that as much</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.050" end="01:04:51.240" style="s2">as we are not totally free we are freer</p>

<p begin="01:04:51.240" end="01:04:56.430" style="s2">mean if you just think about the</p>

<p begin="01:05:03.150" end="01:05:09.440" style="s2">now I mean this has been a radical</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.940" end="01:05:11.400" style="s2">transformation in the direction of</p>

<p begin="01:05:14.730" end="01:05:19.860" style="s2">good I would say with in respect to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.270" end="01:05:21.840" style="s2">know homosexuals not having to live</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.860" end="01:05:24.360" style="s2">their life in the closet it&#39;s all good</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.840" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">it&#39;s all good what an inhumane way to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.360" end="01:05:28.140" style="s2">have lived and then we know from the</p>

<p begin="01:05:37.320" end="01:05:41.760" style="s2">humans is disgusting right it is and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.840" end="01:05:46.680" style="s2">you could say something similar about</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.760" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">women who frankly are now quite free to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.680" end="01:05:51.180" style="s2">choose to do things that only men had</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:53.370" style="s2">access to and whether they do choose to</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.370" end="01:05:57.900" style="s2">you know we can discuss and we can talk</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.490" end="01:06:00.330" style="s2">about the reasons that they might not</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.900" end="01:06:02.490" style="s2">but the fact is I see it as nothing but</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.330" end="01:06:05.340" style="s2">positive that somebody who is born</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.490" end="01:06:08.010" style="s2">female gets to decide what role they</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.150" end="01:06:17.730" style="s2">close student of feminism for a long</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.430" end="01:06:20.670" style="s2">time and one of my quotes I hope will</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.730" end="01:06:23.130" style="s2">live beyond me is that when the scholars</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.670" end="01:06:25.830" style="s2">of 5,000 years from now look back at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.130" end="01:06:27.780" style="s2">20th century I suspect that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.830" end="01:06:30.450" style="s2">going to be impressed by world war ii</p>

<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:37.499" style="s2">stand out in his store</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.869" end="01:06:39.420" style="s2">terms is that for the first time in at</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.499" end="01:06:41.130" style="s2">least 12,000 years of history and more</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.420" end="01:06:44.249" style="s2">likely 200 thousand years of history</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.130" end="01:06:47.519" style="s2">women in a small part of the world the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.249" end="01:06:49.380" style="s2">West finally started to be able to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.519" end="01:06:50.789" style="s2">free of the patriarchy you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.380" end="01:06:54.420" style="s2">journey that&#39;s still not done to this</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.789" end="01:06:57.299" style="s2">day but by 1975 it felt to me like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.420" end="01:06:58.650" style="s2">corner had been turned and that at least</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.299" end="01:07:00.569" style="s2">people who were thinking with a clear</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.650" end="01:07:02.969" style="s2">head knew that women should have every</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.569" end="01:07:05.130" style="s2">opportunity men should have and if this</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.969" end="01:07:07.380" style="s2">actually does work its way through it</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.130" end="01:07:09.809" style="s2">seems like it is that will be the most</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.809" end="01:07:14.910" style="s2">evolution in a very long time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.779" end="01:07:18.059" style="s2">spectacular and I mean the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.910" end="01:07:22.589" style="s2">is all right there was a lot of discord</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.059" end="01:07:25.170" style="s2">along the way but frankly as much as it</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.589" end="01:07:28.469" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work perfectly yet it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.170" end="01:07:31.430" style="s2">how well it works yeah we have not</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.469" end="01:07:36.719" style="s2">seamlessly but we have effectively</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.430" end="01:07:39.479" style="s2">figured our way to a much more honorable</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.479" end="01:07:45.479" style="s2">something to be proud of as Douglas</p>

<p begin="01:08:37.559" end="01:08:42.690" style="s2">you know I doubt that the distinctions</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.569" end="01:08:46.469" style="s2">at that level of career choice are due</p>

<p begin="01:08:59.130" end="01:09:03.950" style="s2">right on down the line it would seem to</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.050" end="01:09:07.140" style="s2">be highly unusual if somehow the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.950" end="01:09:09.870" style="s2">academic culture of computer science was</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.140" end="01:09:13.440" style="s2">so different as to produce a 10 or 15</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.870" end="01:09:16.020" style="s2">percent result I think that&#39;s shows some</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.440" end="01:09:19.560" style="s2">light on this is the situation in Sweden</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.020" end="01:09:21.750" style="s2">Sweden is without a doubt the Society in</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.560" end="01:09:24.120" style="s2">human history that has gone the furthest</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.750" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">not all the way there&#39;s still issues we</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.120" end="01:09:29.550" style="s2">all know that in gender equality and yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:32.460" style="s2">in Sweden a higher percentage of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.550" end="01:09:35.250" style="s2">Engineers are men than in the United</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.460" end="01:09:38.550" style="s2">States and in Sweden a higher percentage</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.250" end="01:09:41.520" style="s2">of nurses are women than in the United</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.550" end="01:09:43.530" style="s2">States so it seems to at least throw</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.520" end="01:09:46.410" style="s2">some light to my mind on the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.530" end="01:09:47.970" style="s2">the inherent differences between men and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.410" end="01:09:51.390" style="s2">women which as we pointed out earlier</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.970" end="01:09:53.550" style="s2">are real could well result in different</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.390" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">choices about careers and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.550" end="01:09:58.500" style="s2">necessarily mean there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:10:00.450" style="s2">with those institutions sure it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.500" end="01:10:04.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean anything of the kind nor do</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.450" end="01:10:07.650" style="s2">we know where those inherent differences</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.740" end="01:10:09.150" style="s2">between males and females live they</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.650" end="01:10:12.060" style="s2">could be in the genes but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.150" end="01:10:14.970" style="s2">have to be one of the things that is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.060" end="01:10:17.480" style="s2">very important realization that comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.970" end="01:10:20.970" style="s2">from recognizing that the genome has</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.480" end="01:10:22.920" style="s2">been much of the work that the genome</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.970" end="01:10:26.940" style="s2">once did in our lineage has been</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.920" end="01:10:29.010" style="s2">offloaded to the cultural layer but the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.940" end="01:10:32.490" style="s2">cultural layer is still an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.010" end="01:10:34.230" style="s2">layer and so it&#39;s quite possible for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.490" end="01:10:37.860" style="s2">differences in preference to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.230" end="01:10:40.320" style="s2">transmitted culturally that does not</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.860" end="01:10:43.170" style="s2">however mean that they are arbitrary it</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.320" end="01:10:45.900" style="s2">is also worth pointing out that although</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.170" end="01:10:49.970" style="s2">it is true that some of the jobs in</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.900" end="01:10:52.380" style="s2">which the most glory is found are</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.970" end="01:10:55.290" style="s2">disproportionately inhabited by men men</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.380" end="01:10:58.260" style="s2">also inhabit many of the jobs in which</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.290" end="01:11:01.699" style="s2">there is disproportionate danger or in</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.260" end="01:11:05.389" style="s2">which the work is particularly discussed</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.699" end="01:11:08.210" style="s2">and so I&#39;m not going to pretend to tell</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.389" end="01:11:09.980" style="s2">you that I know what a totally fair</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.210" end="01:11:11.329" style="s2">world would look like in terms of what</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.980" end="01:11:14.389" style="s2">people would choose but I certainly</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.329" end="01:11:17.059" style="s2">would not expect a totally fair world to</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.389" end="01:11:19.190" style="s2">result in equal representation of men</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.059" end="01:11:22.670" style="s2">and women in all fields that&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.190" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">is a fairy tale I think I&#39;m on board</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.670" end="01:11:25.880" style="s2">with you there and it would you know I</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:27.679" style="s2">think to your point who would you say to</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.880" end="01:11:29.510" style="s2">somebody Murray Douglas Murray wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.679" end="01:11:31.070" style="s2">the guys that listener yeah I think he</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.510" end="01:11:33.440" style="s2">the way you described it seems right to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.070" end="01:11:35.480" style="s2">me that we arrived at the station but</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.440" end="01:11:39.170" style="s2">the train didn&#39;t stop yes it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.480" end="01:11:42.079" style="s2">accelerated into these post truths hosts</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.170" end="01:11:43.699" style="s2">reality based arguments of the sort that</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.079" end="01:11:45.829" style="s2">you know that we all they&#39;re all very</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.699" end="01:11:47.360" style="s2">aware of it&#39;s been a good conversation</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.829" end="01:11:48.949" style="s2">there let&#39;s move on to a couple smaller</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.360" end="01:11:50.929" style="s2">topics we can move through quickly and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.949" end="01:11:52.730" style="s2">wrap up here in about ten minutes if</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.929" end="01:11:54.199" style="s2">that works for you sure you know one</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.730" end="01:11:56.960" style="s2">thing I picked up in in some of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.199" end="01:12:00.829" style="s2">writings about you and by you is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.960" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">despite being a self-proclaimed atheist</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.829" end="01:12:06.650" style="s2">you established a distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:09.530" style="s2">your beliefs and what are sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.650" end="01:12:12.770" style="s2">called the New Atheists guys like Pinker</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.530" end="01:12:15.559" style="s2">Dawkins Hitchens and I&#39;m going to argue</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.770" end="01:12:17.449" style="s2">in a minute unfairly Dennett could you</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.559" end="01:12:20.150" style="s2">describe how it is you distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.449" end="01:12:22.550" style="s2">yourself from these new atheists and how</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.150" end="01:12:24.230" style="s2">well this is interesting actually I</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.550" end="01:12:27.110" style="s2">mentioned earlier in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.230" end="01:12:30.469" style="s2">that I had only a few times said</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.110" end="01:12:34.550" style="s2">something online that had resulted in an</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.469" end="01:12:37.190" style="s2">intemperate response from Twitter and</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.550" end="01:12:41.469" style="s2">one of them the most recent one had to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.190" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">do with my use of the term new atheism</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.469" end="01:12:47.170" style="s2">which resulted in an amazing amount of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:50.780" style="s2">firepower coming back at me including</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.170" end="01:12:56.119" style="s2">Richard Dawkins Steven Pinker Michael</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.780" end="01:12:57.079" style="s2">Shermer Jerry Coyne and Neil Shubin all</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.119" end="01:12:58.909" style="s2">of whom reacted</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.079" end="01:13:01.239" style="s2">none of them on the topic of atheism</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.909" end="01:13:05.449" style="s2">though they all came back at me on</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.239" end="01:13:08.449" style="s2">Darwinian topics but all right after my</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.449" end="01:13:11.989" style="s2">invoking new atheism and I&#39;m quite sure</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.449" end="01:13:14.360" style="s2">that that was the trigger the reason</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.989" end="01:13:18.770" style="s2">that my view on this</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.360" end="01:13:20.659" style="s2">is contentious is that the so-called New</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.770" end="01:13:24.500" style="s2">Atheists oh I am going to use that term</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.659" end="01:13:26.840" style="s2">I I believe Sam Harris uses that term</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.500" end="01:13:30.489" style="s2">sometimes so it has at least a certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.840" end="01:13:35.510" style="s2">degree of legitimacy the difference is I</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.489" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">believe that religion must have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.510" end="01:13:41.150" style="s2">that the meaning of long-standing</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:44.780" style="s2">religious traditions is a Darwinian</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.150" end="01:13:47.270" style="s2">meaning which does not imply that in our</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.780" end="01:13:49.760" style="s2">modern circumstances that these ancient</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.270" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">stories are the guide to what we should</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.760" end="01:13:53.810" style="s2">be doing that is likely to be true in</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.900" style="s2">some cases but it is almost certain not</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.810" end="01:13:58.760" style="s2">to be true in many others the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.900" end="01:14:01.100" style="s2">that Darwinian evolution does not</p>

<p begin="01:14:01.100" end="01:14:04.719" style="s2">we live it prepares them for the</p>

<p begin="01:14:04.719" end="01:14:10.340" style="s2">don&#39;t live in the environments where</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:13.010" style="s2">religious traditions evolved so in some</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.340" end="01:14:15.139" style="s2">sense even a recognition that these are</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.010" end="01:14:18.290" style="s2">a kind of ancient wisdom that has been</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.139" end="01:14:21.190" style="s2">encoded in a cultural package that is</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.290" end="01:14:25.489" style="s2">easily transmitted even that recognition</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.190" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">leaves us with the profound sense that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.489" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">we must now figure out what to do next</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:34.940" style="s2">because those stories are not up to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.840" end="01:14:38.060" style="s2">challenges of the 21st century but what</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.940" end="01:14:41.810" style="s2">I found is that and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.060" end="01:14:42.610" style="s2">historical path here we even twenty</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.810" end="01:14:48.139" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.610" end="01:14:52.040" style="s2">lived in a paradigm in which the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.139" end="01:14:54.710" style="s2">being an atheist made a person suspect</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.040" end="01:14:56.780" style="s2">in the eyes of the majority there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.710" end="01:14:58.600" style="s2">question about whether or not an atheist</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.780" end="01:15:03.230" style="s2">for example could be elected to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.600" end="01:15:07.580" style="s2">highest office in the land and new</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.230" end="01:15:10.520" style="s2">atheism arose in response to that</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.580" end="01:15:13.880" style="s2">paradigm the problem is it drew the</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.520" end="01:15:17.150" style="s2">picture far too simply and quite</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.880" end="01:15:20.739" style="s2">unfairly to those who retain some</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.150" end="01:15:26.420" style="s2">connection to their religious past and</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.739" end="01:15:28.159" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been saying is that religion</p>

<p begin="01:18:07.250" end="01:18:11.900" style="s2">is absolutely true evolution religion</p>

<p begin="01:18:20.570" end="01:18:24.740" style="s2">it seems kind of far afield but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.790" end="01:18:27.050" style="s2">been the case I always ask them and your</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.740" end="01:18:29.750" style="s2">field of study has there ever been the</p>

<p begin="01:18:42.310" end="01:18:47.720" style="s2">everyone of them and most of them are</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.540" end="01:18:49.510" style="s2">atheist themselves have said absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.720" end="01:18:53.270" style="s2">not such a thing would be utterly</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.510" end="01:18:55.910" style="s2">inconceivable in a you know pre-modern</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.270" end="01:18:58.550" style="s2">person and so that&#39;s led me to believe</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.910" end="01:19:00.740" style="s2">that the phenomenon known as religion</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.550" end="01:19:03.110" style="s2">has been ubiquitous as far back as we</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.740" end="01:19:05.090" style="s2">know and for it to have been ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.110" end="01:19:07.400" style="s2">despite its high cost it must have been</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.090" end="01:19:09.830" style="s2">adaptive in some fashion so what you say</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.400" end="01:19:12.560" style="s2">is true however this is where maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.830" end="01:19:14.690" style="s2">turned one step further around the bend</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.560" end="01:19:16.370" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a mass delusion</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.690" end="01:19:18.710" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s just not true</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.370" end="01:19:20.900" style="s2">Thor did not does not cause thunder Zeus</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.710" end="01:19:23.780" style="s2">does not throw lightning bolts and every</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.900" end="01:19:25.400" style="s2">time science has made an incursion into</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.780" end="01:19:26.810" style="s2">the world of the metaphysical science</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.400" end="01:19:29.180" style="s2">has always been right the meta</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.810" end="01:19:31.010" style="s2">physicians have always been wrong so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.180" end="01:19:34.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.010" end="01:19:38.420" style="s2">it is evolutionary it was adaptive and</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.280" end="01:19:40.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a mass delusion is color a mass</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.420" end="01:19:43.410" style="s2">delusion</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.380" end="01:19:44.580" style="s2">it&#39;s color uh it depends on what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.410" end="01:19:47.030" style="s2">talking about we do have we have our</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.580" end="01:19:49.170" style="s2">rods and we have our cones right and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.030" end="01:19:51.510" style="s2">difficut which ones which the cuttings</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.170" end="01:19:53.490" style="s2">the cones that are for the color yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.510" end="01:19:56.760" style="s2">all right and so they fire under</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.490" end="01:19:59.010" style="s2">different frequencies so we have in our</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.760" end="01:20:00.390" style="s2">brains we get different signals from the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.010" end="01:20:03.180" style="s2">different colors so I would say colors</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.390" end="01:20:07.320" style="s2">are real color is not a delusion no but</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.180" end="01:20:08.550" style="s2">the experience of color is it is well</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.320" end="01:20:11.820" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.550" end="01:20:14.580" style="s2">photos of Saturn for example sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.820" end="01:20:16.980" style="s2">you&#39;ll see true color photos and</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.580" end="01:20:20.250" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;ll see photos in which the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.980" end="01:20:22.380" style="s2">color wheel has been rotated to</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.250" end="01:20:25.170" style="s2">highlight things that are hard to see</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.380" end="01:20:27.330" style="s2">with the standard color okay so we would</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.170" end="01:20:30.470" style="s2">say it&#39;s false color right but the fact</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.330" end="01:20:34.020" style="s2">is the experience of color that you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.470" end="01:20:41.360" style="s2">inside your mind in fact the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.020" end="01:20:44.970" style="s2">the the room you are in is visible is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.360" end="01:20:47.160" style="s2">mass delusion of a kind the room you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.970" end="01:20:48.330" style="s2">in is also filled with radio waves and</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.160" end="01:20:49.800" style="s2">they&#39;re bouncing off things in</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.330" end="01:20:51.540" style="s2">particular waves you just don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.800" end="01:20:53.370" style="s2">to have a detector that organizes that</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.540" end="01:20:55.830" style="s2">information into some sort of subjective</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.370" end="01:20:58.440" style="s2">experience so you experience the room as</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.830" end="01:21:01.800" style="s2">empty of radio waves and full of color</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.440" end="01:21:04.140" style="s2">and the color is a trick of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.800" end="01:21:06.420" style="s2">that allows you to quickly categorize</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.140" end="01:21:08.370" style="s2">objects as to think from each other so</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.420" end="01:21:11.370" style="s2">that you know where one starts and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.370" end="01:21:15.960" style="s2">other stops and my point is I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.370" end="01:21:19.410" style="s2">saying that it&#39;s a delusion I believe it</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.960" end="01:21:22.140" style="s2">is a useful heuristic right it is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.410" end="01:21:24.870" style="s2">heuristic that is not analytical it is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.140" end="01:21:26.640" style="s2">heuristic that is experiential and</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.870" end="01:21:29.340" style="s2">allows you to navigate the world quickly</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.640" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">without thinking about it but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.340" end="01:21:36.110" style="s2">somebody could portray it as a delusion</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.840" end="01:21:38.690" style="s2">in the same sense that we can portray</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.110" end="01:21:41.700" style="s2">belief systems that have made people</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.690" end="01:21:44.780" style="s2">successful as a delusion but the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.700" end="01:21:49.160" style="s2">connotation of the word delusion is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.780" end="01:21:53.550" style="s2">unfair the fact is we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.160" end="01:21:57.059" style="s2">compendiums of adaptive belief</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.550" end="01:21:59.389" style="s2">and to the extent that you want to take</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.059" end="01:22:02.369" style="s2">anything which is not a perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.389" end="01:22:03.869" style="s2">literal belief and say it&#39;s a delusion</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.369" end="01:22:05.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to end up dragging in</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.869" end="01:22:08.040" style="s2">many of the models that we use in</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.760" end="01:22:10.079" style="s2">science to which are also approximate I</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.040" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">would say this is qualitatively</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.079" end="01:22:14.429" style="s2">different they make specific claims</p>

<p begin="01:22:30.510" end="01:22:35.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what we call qualia the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.809" end="01:22:36.480" style="s2">subjective experience of color and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.520" end="01:22:39.750" style="s2">would say that&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.480" end="01:22:41.550" style="s2">thing than a system of beliefs operates</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.750" end="01:22:43.440" style="s2">in a different domain entirely so much</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.550" end="01:22:45.719" style="s2">or that comparison was particularly apt</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.440" end="01:22:49.860" style="s2">well but the question is where are you</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.719" end="01:22:52.469" style="s2">gonna draw the line how literal does a</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.860" end="01:22:54.300" style="s2">scientific model have to be before</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.469" end="01:22:56.250" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna exclude it from the realm</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.300" end="01:22:58.020" style="s2">of delusion I agree with you that there</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.250" end="01:23:01.409" style="s2">is a distinction between a claim about</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.020" end="01:23:05.280" style="s2">where the Sun is relative to the earth</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.409" end="01:23:08.460" style="s2">but you also have models in science that</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.280" end="01:23:10.050" style="s2">are approximate and they get better over</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.460" end="01:23:12.179" style="s2">time you know we say they&#39;re approximate</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.050" end="01:23:14.909" style="s2">the whole doctrine of science is that</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.179" end="01:23:17.340" style="s2">everything that we say we think is true</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.909" end="01:23:20.159" style="s2">today we know is wrong in some detail in</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.340" end="01:23:22.710" style="s2">some way and that overtime experiment</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.159" end="01:23:24.300" style="s2">and data will in some cases fine-tune</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.710" end="01:23:25.710" style="s2">what we believe and sometimes turn it</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.300" end="01:23:27.869" style="s2">completely on its head if it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.710" end="01:23:29.820" style="s2">you know Einstein entirely turned on its</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.869" end="01:23:32.400" style="s2">head the Newtonian perspective of</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.820" end="01:23:34.500" style="s2">absolute space and time and every good</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.400" end="01:23:36.809" style="s2">scientist knows that and knows it in</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.500" end="01:23:38.730" style="s2">their bones you know religion is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.809" end="01:23:41.250" style="s2">exact opposite of that I think maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.730" end="01:23:43.170" style="s2">you&#39;re miss you&#39;re miss hearing me in</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.250" end="01:23:45.570" style="s2">some sense then because it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.170" end="01:23:48.300" style="s2">like you think that there are</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.570" end="01:23:51.210" style="s2">circumstances in which we should</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.300" end="01:23:53.520" style="s2">prioritize factual claims coming from</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.210" end="01:23:56.460" style="s2">religion in spite of scientific evidence</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.520" end="01:23:58.290" style="s2">that is not what I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.460" end="01:24:01.099" style="s2">saying is that those claims have</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.290" end="01:24:05.849" style="s2">persisted because they have been</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.099" end="01:24:07.680" style="s2">effective and so for example you have in</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.849" end="01:24:12.930" style="s2">the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.680" end="01:24:17.130" style="s2">you have a repeated invocation of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.930" end="01:24:19.980" style="s2">concept of Filth basically and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.130" end="01:24:23.130" style="s2">deity not wanting filth in certain</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.980" end="01:24:27.180" style="s2">places like in the middle of camp now</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.130" end="01:24:30.510" style="s2">that belief that there is some force in</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.180" end="01:24:34.170" style="s2">the universe that cares where filth ends</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.510" end="01:24:37.050" style="s2">up is not literal</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.170" end="01:24:39.990" style="s2">it is literally false but it is</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.050" end="01:24:42.570" style="s2">metaphorically true in the sense that it</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.990" end="01:24:47.520" style="s2">prevents disease from spreading in camp</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.570" end="01:24:49.680" style="s2">so what I had the fair comparison is for</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.520" end="01:24:52.370" style="s2">a population that exists thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.680" end="01:24:56.040" style="s2">years before the germ theory of disease</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.370" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">would you have them abandon a belief</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.040" end="01:25:02.400" style="s2">that a deity cares where filth ends up</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.280" end="01:25:04.800" style="s2">waiting for the enlightenment to deliver</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.400" end="01:25:08.630" style="s2">the tools to understand what microbes</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.800" end="01:25:12.180" style="s2">and pathogens are or would you have them</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.630" end="01:25:13.800" style="s2">utilize their shorthand belief for</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.180" end="01:25:18.090" style="s2">something in the universe cares where</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.800" end="01:25:21.330" style="s2">this stuff goes waiting for a better</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.090" end="01:25:23.610" style="s2">deeper understanding to supplant it when</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.330" end="01:25:26.130" style="s2">the evidence says it&#39;s time to do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.610" end="01:25:27.930" style="s2">that&#39;s where I would fall out and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.130" end="01:25:30.630" style="s2">think that&#39;s all right you know in fact</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.930" end="01:25:32.490" style="s2">the line I draw is Darwin here was a big</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.630" end="01:25:35.730" style="s2">question where the hell did life come</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.490" end="01:25:37.740" style="s2">from what are humans really and before</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.730" end="01:25:40.170" style="s2">Darwin provided a good answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.740" end="01:25:41.790" style="s2">you know believing some story about how</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.170" end="01:25:43.710" style="s2">it all happened seemed to me reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.790" end="01:25:45.060" style="s2">but that was a long time ago yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.710" end="01:25:47.520" style="s2">was over 150 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.060" end="01:25:49.410" style="s2">and yet people are still clinging to</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.520" end="01:25:51.390" style="s2">these things and it&#39;s not to say they</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.410" end="01:25:52.950" style="s2">aren&#39;t adaptive and I absolutely agree</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.390" end="01:25:54.540" style="s2">they almost certainly work as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.950" end="01:25:56.790" style="s2">expensive and they&#39;ve existed in</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.540" end="01:25:58.260" style="s2">essentially every culture that we know</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.790" end="01:26:00.750" style="s2">about but I would put them in the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.260" end="01:26:02.730" style="s2">basket of xenophobia and patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.750" end="01:26:04.650" style="s2">things that probably were adaptive and</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.730" end="01:26:06.810" style="s2">useful in our past and especially in our</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.650" end="01:26:09.840" style="s2">Pleistocene path and now it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.810" end="01:26:13.650" style="s2">pitch them ah so I agree with you about</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.840" end="01:26:16.080" style="s2">it is time to pitch them but I would say</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.650" end="01:26:17.970" style="s2">we have to qualify that a if we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.080" end="01:26:20.070" style="s2">going to get people to listen to us</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.970" end="01:26:22.650" style="s2">about the necessity</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.070" end="01:26:26.280" style="s2">of moving towards a system in which we</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.650" end="01:26:27.840" style="s2">are governed by what it is we know we</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.280" end="01:26:29.849" style="s2">have to understand what the hazards that</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.840" end="01:26:31.050" style="s2">come along with that are in other words</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.849" end="01:26:33.570" style="s2">there are some realms where we know a</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.050" end="01:26:35.340" style="s2">lot chemistry for example there are some</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.570" end="01:26:38.670" style="s2">realms where we are still pretty new at</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.340" end="01:26:41.790" style="s2">it biology there are things about these</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.670" end="01:26:44.550" style="s2">compendiums of belief that we can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.790" end="01:26:47.250" style="s2">we don&#39;t necessarily know how these</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.550" end="01:26:49.320" style="s2">biblical texts for example have served</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.250" end="01:26:51.780" style="s2">the populations who believed in them and</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.320" end="01:26:53.969" style="s2">therefore we&#39;ve got Chesterton&#39;s fence</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.780" end="01:26:56.699" style="s2">issue with respect to throwing these</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.969" end="01:26:59.099" style="s2">things out so what I&#39;m concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.699" end="01:27:01.050" style="s2">is that in hearing me say something</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.099" end="01:27:03.599" style="s2">other than the standard atheist line</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.050" end="01:27:04.980" style="s2">about well it&#39;s time to walk away from</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.599" end="01:27:06.780" style="s2">these beliefs whatever they are and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.980" end="01:27:08.699" style="s2">fully embrace the Enlightenment model</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.780" end="01:27:10.199" style="s2">well I&#39;m on board with the idea that we</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.699" end="01:27:13.050" style="s2">have to be governed by the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.199" end="01:27:16.560" style="s2">model but I would caution that we are</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.050" end="01:27:18.389" style="s2">not yet in a position to simply say</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.560" end="01:27:20.880" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s true and this is what it</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.389" end="01:27:23.730" style="s2">implies about how we should live we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.880" end="01:27:25.320" style="s2">still coming to understand that Darwin</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.730" end="01:27:28.949" style="s2">may seem like he&#39;s a very long time ago</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.320" end="01:27:30.989" style="s2">but really it isn&#39;t very long at all in</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.949" end="01:27:33.719" style="s2">terms of the time necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.989" end="01:27:36.960" style="s2">comprehend our situation and our</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.719" end="01:27:39.510" style="s2">understanding of human evolution has</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.960" end="01:27:41.429" style="s2">actually lagged quite a bit behind our</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.510" end="01:27:43.440" style="s2">understanding of the evolution of other</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.429" end="01:27:46.909" style="s2">creatures in part because human beings</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.440" end="01:27:51.119" style="s2">evolved in a fundamentally different way</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.909" end="01:27:53.099" style="s2">so I am NOT hoping to coddle these</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.119" end="01:27:55.920" style="s2">beliefs there are many reasons that we</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.099" end="01:27:58.489" style="s2">should look at the inherited wisdom that</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.920" end="01:28:01.590" style="s2">comes along with religious belief and</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.489" end="01:28:04.050" style="s2">register it as a mismatch for the 21st</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.590" end="01:28:07.139" style="s2">century because it can&#39;t help but be</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.050" end="01:28:09.389" style="s2">mismatched but if we are to make an</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.139" end="01:28:11.929" style="s2">argument about what must be done instead</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.389" end="01:28:15.659" style="s2">that argument should be grounded as</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.929" end="01:28:17.550" style="s2">carefully as we can in the deepest</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.659" end="01:28:19.880" style="s2">science we have available and that says</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.550" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">we have to take this stuff seriously as</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.880" end="01:28:26.070" style="s2">adaptive phenomena rather than delusion</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:27.810" style="s2">or pathology yeah see I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.070" end="01:28:29.610" style="s2">not pathology but it&#39;s delusion but</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.810" end="01:28:30.869" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to agree on this one you</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.610" end="01:28:33.030" style="s2">know I think it sounds like I&#39;m halfway</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.869" end="01:28:34.890" style="s2">in between the New Atheists and you yes</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.030" end="01:28:36.960" style="s2">evolved it was certainly adaptive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.890" end="01:28:38.760" style="s2">not path wasn&#39;t pathological and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.960" end="01:28:41.010" style="s2">place the scene probably wasn&#39;t up until</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.760" end="01:28:42.150" style="s2">the time of Darwin but now it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.010" end="01:28:44.460" style="s2">that anyone who&#39;s paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.150" end="01:28:47.060" style="s2">should say alright time to pitch it just</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.460" end="01:28:50.520" style="s2">like marxist-leninist</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.060" end="01:28:52.560" style="s2">were thinking about until you know 1932</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.520" end="01:28:55.950" style="s2">right the purges well I would say then</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.560" end="01:29:00.900" style="s2">it&#39;s something like our insatiable</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.950" end="01:29:03.420" style="s2">desire for carbohydrates right that</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.900" end="01:29:06.570" style="s2">obviously has an easy to interpret</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.420" end="01:29:08.010" style="s2">meaning in a past environment but in our</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.570" end="01:29:09.200" style="s2">current environment the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.010" end="01:29:11.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no limit on how many</p>
