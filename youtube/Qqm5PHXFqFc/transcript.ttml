<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">this the call to bring all humans back</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.050" end="00:05:01.590" style="s2">into unity to bring all of consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.370" end="00:05:40.590" style="s2">or is it really just connection is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.460" end="00:05:44.070" style="s2">connection then I&#39;m really looking for</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.590" end="00:05:48.410" style="s2">what is unity if it is lonely if all of</p>
