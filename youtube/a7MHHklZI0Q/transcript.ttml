<p begin="00:00:05.580" end="00:00:09.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to go into the history but there&#39;s<br />actually a really neat history of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:14.370" style="s2">why and how a particular set of ideas became<br />so important in the latter half of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.370" end="00:00:15.370" style="s2">century.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.370" end="00:00:19.939" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you just one example, but the idea<br />of operational management, which was innovated</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.939" end="00:00:26.990" style="s2">during the heat of World War II and largely<br />to do things like make strategic decisions</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.990" end="00:00:34.769" style="s2">about how we were going to go about moving<br />ships across the Atlantic or run bombing raids</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.769" end="00:00:41.589" style="s2">on Germany using statistics, actually applying<br />statistics to analyze the effectiveness of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.589" end="00:00:45.770" style="s2">different approaches and then therefore making<br />decisions based on statistics.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.770" end="00:00:48.900" style="s2">And so operational management was very effective<br />in the military theater and the people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.900" end="00:00:53.949" style="s2">had learned those techniques after the war<br />percolated out into the broader economy and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.949" end="00:00:57.630" style="s2">started applying those techniques in things<br />like deciding how to run their businesses.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.630" end="00:01:03.019" style="s2">So that&#39;s the basic framework of the order<br />that we built up until now.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.019" end="00:01:11.320" style="s2">Now, the idea of the Blue Church is trying<br />to get a sense of what it is that is the essence</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.320" end="00:01:14.470" style="s2">of the control structure.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.470" end="00:01:18.120" style="s2">By control I don&#39;t mean necessarily anything<br />bad I just mean the mechanism by which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.120" end="00:01:22.930" style="s2">able to make collective decisions and engage<br />in effective collective actions, the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.930" end="00:01:26.990" style="s2">that holds our decision and action structure<br />together.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.990" end="00:01:31.950" style="s2">The control structure that still is the one<br />that we&#39;re operating under that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.950" end="00:01:38.270" style="s2">that timeframe and the proposition is that,<br />in addition to—and this is one piece but</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.270" end="00:01:44.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a very important piece—that there&#39;s<br />a dominant role played by the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.570" end="00:01:45.570" style="s2">media.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.570" end="00:01:51.140" style="s2">We&#39;re actually in the process of breaking<br />that apart right here so this is good.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.140" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">We know that there&#39;s a particular dynamic<br />associated with the kinds of media that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:04.210" style="s2">broadcast where one individual or group, because<br />of the nature of the medium, so for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.210" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">broadcast television in the day of three networks<br />there was only three people who got to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:12.140" style="s2">the anchors who communicated out to the entire<br />population.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.140" end="00:02:18.770" style="s2">It was a massive asymmetry between the speaker<br />and the listener and there&#39;s no interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.770" end="00:02:23.091" style="s2">So I am in a position of listening, you&#39;re<br />in a position of speaking and there&#39;s 30 million</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.091" end="00:02:24.670" style="s2">of me and one of you.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.670" end="00:02:27.600" style="s2">Now, that&#39;s actually a very important dynamic.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.600" end="00:02:31.740" style="s2">If you don&#39;t understand the fact of that and<br />its importance you&#39;re going to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.740" end="00:02:36.440" style="s2">hard time understanding what actually happened<br />during the latter half of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.440" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">as, in particular, television emerged as the<br />dominant medium displacing radio and newspapers.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:45.630" style="s2">And by the way, you also have a hard time<br />understanding what&#39;s happening now has the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.630" end="00:02:49.300" style="s2">Internet is now emerging as the dominant medium<br />replacing television.</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.300" end="00:02:54.070" style="s2">Just understanding that transition and what<br />it implies and means at a deep level is sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.070" end="00:02:57.370" style="s2">of fundamental for predicting future states.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.370" end="00:03:03.590" style="s2">So using sort of television as the metaphor<br />I then looked back and said: all right are</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.590" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">there other things that we see that look like<br />that?</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">And it&#39;s actually quite interesting that,<br />for example, school has a very similar shape</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:16.810" style="s2">to it in the sense that you&#39;ve got one speaker,<br />a large audience and a very little interactivity,</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.810" end="00:03:19.959" style="s2">particularly like the university setting where<br />there&#39;s a lecture and there&#39;s 500 people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.959" end="00:03:21.130" style="s2">the lecture hall.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.130" end="00:03:26.930" style="s2">That is effectively the same thing as television<br />in the sense that the relationship of information</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.930" end="00:03:29.350" style="s2">flow is effectively the same.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.350" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">This is important both from sort of the social<br />dynamics as well as the psychological dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">because if as a child your primary relationship<br />to how you engage in culture is one of almost</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:47.739" style="s2">certainly being a pure receiver then your<br />psychological development, your set of assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.739" end="00:03:53.570" style="s2">and habituations and how you adapt to the<br />world, will be associated with that environment.</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.570" end="00:04:00.330" style="s2">You&#39;re adapting to your local environment<br />and this implies a certain set of deep psychological</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.330" end="00:04:01.330" style="s2">structures.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.330" end="00:04:08.440" style="s2">So we get a relationship between the mechanisms<br />and techniques and potentialities of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.440" end="00:04:15.519" style="s2">as a concept—so school, television, fill<br />in the blank—and the behavior strategies,</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.519" end="00:04:19.370" style="s2">the habits, and even the capacities of the<br />individuals in the social layer.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.370" end="00:04:23.889" style="s2">So when you get to the mid and late &#39;90s you&#39;re<br />actually dealing with a society that could</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.889" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">be understood as the society of broadcast<br />and that has implications for how decisions</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:30.919" style="s2">are made.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.919" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">So the society of broadcasts is characterized<br />by what you might call the Encyclopedia Britannica</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">model or the Walter Cronkite model where you<br />have a set of hierarchical structures where</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:48.370" style="s2">the individuals who have permission, authority,<br />and responsibility for speaking, for having</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.370" end="00:04:52.699" style="s2">authority are selected in some fashion to<br />be positioned at the top of the broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.699" end="00:04:57.089" style="s2">hierarchy and then the rest of us defer to<br />them.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.089" end="00:05:01.089" style="s2">And so somebody has written an article in<br />the Encyclopedia Britannica or some group</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.089" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">of people, some group of experts who have<br />been nominated in some fashion to be positioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:10.779" style="s2">as experts and at best take that responsibility<br />very seriously, they pull the total set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.779" end="00:05:14.669" style="s2">questions back into their centers of excellence<br />so they&#39;re having conversations in academic</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.669" end="00:05:19.809" style="s2">environments and groups that get together<br />in think tanks, they produce an authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.809" end="00:05:24.259" style="s2">statement of what is in fact our collective<br />opinion around this particular object.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.259" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">They then disseminate it through a broadcast<br />medium and the rest of us listen to it, cohere</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.009" style="s2">around it and say okay that&#39;s what we do and<br />then move forward.</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.009" end="00:05:37.469" style="s2">And this is actually a very powerful mechanism<br />because it allows us to simultaneously have</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.469" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">hundreds of millions of people broadly share<br />the basic set of assumptions about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:47.779" style="s2">of the world, the nature of what effective<br />action looks like, even values: what is important</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.779" end="00:05:49.159" style="s2">and what&#39;s not important.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.159" end="00:05:53.949" style="s2">So a major piece, not the only piece, but<br />a major piece of the transition that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.949" end="00:06:00.379" style="s2">going through is precisely the fact that the<br />decentralized communication infrastructure,</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.379" end="00:06:05.560" style="s2">sometimes known as the Internet and all of<br />its manifestations and mobile and everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.560" end="00:06:08.699" style="s2">else, radically changes that dynamic.</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.699" end="00:06:16.199" style="s2">So the Internet is characteristically symmetrical,<br />meaning that the number of people who can</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.199" end="00:06:18.949" style="s2">speak is effectively everyone.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.949" end="00:06:23.210" style="s2">Obviously there&#39;s not an even distribution<br />of audience among everyone, but it&#39;s not structurally</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.210" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">locked in.</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">And the relationship between speaking and<br />receiving has become intrinsically or at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:34.280" style="s2">intuitively bi-directional.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.280" end="00:06:40.499" style="s2">Now this shift implies a very large number<br />of differential consequences so we can graph</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.499" end="00:06:48.689" style="s2">the notion of the impact that it has on power<br />and the relationship between decision making</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.689" end="00:06:51.529" style="s2">and action taking.</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.529" end="00:06:54.419" style="s2">But there&#39;s also the impact that it has on<br />psychology.</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.419" end="00:06:59.270" style="s2">The intuitive sense or the way that your brain,<br />in fact even just your sort of way that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.270" end="00:07:03.649" style="s2">go about making decisions in the world, actually<br />has to adaptively change.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.649" end="00:07:09.409" style="s2">So the people who grew up in the post-Internet<br />environment have a fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.409" end="00:07:14.259" style="s2">psychological set of structures like deep<br />habitual architectures and expectations of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.259" end="00:07:19.849" style="s2">how to most effectively present themselves<br />in the world than people who grew up before</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.849" end="00:07:20.849" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.849" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">So what that will mean is two things: one<br />is the set of techniques and approaches that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:34.050" style="s2">socially evolved in the television or in the<br />broadcast era are suddenly maladaptive in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:36.150" style="s2">this new psychological ecosystem.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.150" end="00:07:40.259" style="s2">So think like the Pepsi commercial that so<br />famously was a disaster.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.259" end="00:07:45.099" style="s2">That&#39;s very much the kind of thing that is<br />produced by a broadcast intuition.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.099" end="00:07:49.400" style="s2">&quot;We get to send messages and those messages<br />are things that you receive.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.400" end="00:07:55.189" style="s2">But the psychology and the technology of the<br />Internet or of the decentralized or the symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.189" end="00:07:57.679" style="s2">medium is one of: &quot;No, no we get to critique.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.679" end="00:08:00.330" style="s2">We get to directly respond to.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:05.849" style="s2">And things that feel like they are broadcast<br />or feel like they are quite obviously intending</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.849" end="00:08:11.119" style="s2">to influence us emotionally, we know what<br />that feels like and it doesn&#39;t work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.119" end="00:08:15.639" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to respond to that and our<br />ability to respond swarms around it and breaks</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.639" end="00:08:17.490" style="s2">it up.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.490" end="00:08:23.459" style="s2">And so this, for example, is I think at least<br />a reasonably good explanation for what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.459" end="00:08:28.659" style="s2">happening in the political domain over the<br />past 30 or 40 years and certainly over the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.659" end="00:08:29.300" style="s2">past two.</p>
