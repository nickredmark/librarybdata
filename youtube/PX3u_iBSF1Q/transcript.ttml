<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">kind of context of uh how you came into</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">uh the work that you&#39;re doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">it goes way back um i was just telling</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">my daughter actually she&#39;s 17 now but my</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">husband and i met</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:29.680" style="s2">in 1990 and that was before email or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">before we were using email and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.680" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">so we were writing letters for two years</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">i was in switzerland he was in canada</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">and a lot of our letter writing was</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">actually about community and how we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">to come together as a human family and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">this is what&#39;s stopping the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">so it kind of started i think really</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:48.799" style="s2">through our</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">coming together um as a couple and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.799" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">becoming fellow researchers and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">inquirers into this topic</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">and living in community then for 10</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">years and doing a lot of experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">of what does it take</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">to come together in community</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">or in comunitas where you don&#39;t lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">because we&#39;ve seen that happen and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">not good</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">but also where you don&#39;t just reside in</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">the separate self</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">for all eternity and never actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">evolve what&#39;s possible as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">so that was really the driving inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">for that decade and then beyond we tried</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">it in many different</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">formats retreats seminars</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">living together with people and just our</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">own ongoing study and inquiry in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">and then my therapeutic work is much</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">more one on one and working with couples</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">but it actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">informs the questions hugely because</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:49.919" style="s2">it&#39;s all about what does it take</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">for us humans to show up</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.919" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">in a way beyond all the the labels we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.040" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">put on ourselves what does it take for</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">us to show up for who we truly are</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">and um that is beyond our biography</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">and allow our actual authentic essence</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">to express itself more fully than ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">and yet be present to one another</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">without all these barriers of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">separateness</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">um so that we can actually give rise to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">something that&#39;s much more in our midst</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really been our our focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">is how can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">how can we give voice to that which</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">arises when we come together</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">that is actually more than the sum total</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">of us and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">in our decade of community living we</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:37.440" style="s2">happened i i think a lot of it was grace</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">but we happened to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.440" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">stumble upon some really profound</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">collective experiences of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">right at the start and then we got very</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">curious in unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">what are the what&#39;s the recipe what are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">the ingredients so that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:53.680" style="s2">is not just a state because i think even</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">even to this day</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.680" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">we can experience these deep states of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">togetherness</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">and um and collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">collective wisdom we can experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">these as</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">momentary glimpses and tastes</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">we we have a pretty good read i feel now</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">on what is conducive you know and in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">experience making music together is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">really good inn</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">um celebration dance coming together i</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">was just at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">friend&#39;s wake on sunday and when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">come together with others around things</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">that matter</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">and that remind you of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">context of life</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:30.639" style="s2">that often really brings a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">shared field</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.639" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">in our midst and also when daily life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">challenges and not as present that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">retreats and seminars and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">and you know i&#39;ve never been to burning</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">man i hear it works there too</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">um those kind of events can really allow</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">us to get a taste of what&#39;s possible in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">our collective evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">but then in daily life we seem to trip</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">up a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">and and i feel like we&#39;ve made so much</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">headway in our individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">journeys um but there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">there&#39;s still a real ceiling there as</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">far as our</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">latent potential um being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">to come to fruition in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">and my husband and i are really of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">mind that it is the key to making um</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">making it through into a future that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">sane and sustainable for all</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.280" style="s2">yeah i like that a couple things were</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:31.039" style="s2">coming to mind is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.280" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">you know the what ken wilker talks about</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.039" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">uh from making a state to a trait</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">uh and how practice is needed for that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">and the other thing that came was uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">soryu farrell&#39;s uh who&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">head at the monastic academy when he was</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">talking about circling</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">uh he kind of threw shade at it and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">basically said that uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">circling is um intimacy without</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like kind of get the the various</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">multitude of intimacy but you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">any commitment beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">and in order to make this kind of state</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">into a trait you need some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">structural commitments or calls your</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">practices and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">um yeah any thoughts on anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:10.479" style="s2">i just said right there well i i totally</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.479" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">that um you know i would never negate</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">those moments of intimacy because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">like their doorways their windows into</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">and and i think they fulfill our deepest</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">yearnings</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">in a moment and so it&#39;s it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">kind of get lifted up to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">mountain and you get to see the view</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">um but then you come back down and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">actually have to walk up</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">that path up the mountain and and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">moments when you&#39;re doubting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">and where you know get stormy et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">so back to the the question of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">how can comunitas how can that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">collective being together and giving</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">rise to something</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">in our midst that is more than the sum</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">total of us and that has a voice</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">and that has intention and a will and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">that we could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">receive guidance from for moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">forwards</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">um as a humanity like what does it take</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">in us to be present</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">to that in daily life and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">a bit maybe the topic we could explore</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">today of you know it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:21.040" style="s2">it it is practice it&#39;s like working</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">muscles in us and what are those muscles</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">so i&#39;d be happy to go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">if that feels interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">all of you yeah um before we go on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">thread um</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">i just double click on the word</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">communitas or communitas um</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">uh we have we have like this uh we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.640" style="s2">interest objective practices and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re out uh um mary um margaret</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.640" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">who&#39;s in the</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">it we&#39;re debating we should call it that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of like a mongrel</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">concept at least how i use it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like it means</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">many different things um and i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">distinction i have sort of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">like i</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">it type of way of relating versus an i</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">thou relating also relating for its own</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">sake it&#39;s like practices or a state that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">a lot affords that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">um i&#39;m just curious how how do you hold</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">that term</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">i know i&#39;m the one that suggested it for</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">the title as well but uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">how&#39;s that line for you well i i like it</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">has been used and used and overused and</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">it has a lot of associations for people</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">either just throw them off or actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">guide them down the wrong imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">what how we could evolve that so i i</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">i i stay away from community i often</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">talk more about village</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:42.640" style="s2">or we practices or togetherness um</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">and i love communities actually went and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.640" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">looked up a definition</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">that i could find after you sent me the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:55.200" style="s2">and it resonated beautifully it was um</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">coming together in intimacy right</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.200" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">in liminality so right at that threshold</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">and i thought that was very telling for</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">what we&#39;re exploring because i think one</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">skill sets is actually to become quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">familiar and maybe even comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">being at the edge of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.760" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">together so i i think it&#39;s a great word</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">i like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">i love how you phrase that um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">the inner work needed to get into this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:27.200" style="s2">delicious state</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">uh what do you think okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.200" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">well i&#39;ll stop by saying i think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">ongoing journey</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s never done um</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:40.000" style="s2">that um in in the way i frame it it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.000" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">includes both our vertical</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">maturation and growth and development as</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">well as horizontal capacities and i can</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">get more into what i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">um but with the vertical it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">growing in our consciousness growing in</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">in the journey of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">getting to know remembering who we truly</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:05.600" style="s2">um so practices of stillness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.600" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">really daring to remember</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">that under all the shoulds and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:19.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;ts and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">thoughts and beliefs um</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.760" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">yeah all those those sticky notes that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">we put on ourselves and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">other others put on ourselves there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">core you that was there from the moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">you arrived and that doesn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">need to be developed or constructed that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">is just there is already whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">so to remember that wholeness um or that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">coming home to yourself i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge one and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">and then getting skilled at knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">entering any conversation any</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">any um yeah any relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">which self are you coming from are you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">actually coming from that home</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">within or are you coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:07.519" style="s2">constructed more outside self</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">um that you have built in an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.519" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">manage and function and make do in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">world where once we realize when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">one and a half two that were actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">separate in many ways from our mom and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">dad and siblings and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">around us it can get pretty scary and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">we start patching together a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">constructed self um but</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s one piece is that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">vertical which i think is it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">evolutionary arc we&#39;re all on and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">at different places in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">and each place has its purpose and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:40.720" style="s2">not at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">to make the ego self or you construct</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.720" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">itself bad i actually think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">real mistake</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">i think it&#39;s much more to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">relationship to it so to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">to think of it more as that were a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:54.079" style="s2">of us anyways are still um</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">under the spell of a mistaken identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.079" end="00:13:56.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s much more to write the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:59.839" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.560" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">to that outside constructed self rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.839" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.160" style="s2">to feel like it shouldn&#39;t exist or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.320" style="s2">a bad thing or it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.160" end="00:14:08.320" style="s2">keeping me from my spiritual growth</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.320" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">um i actually think if we didn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t even be here in these</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">in these physical bodies um</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">so so yeah that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">big part of it though is remembering who</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">you are and being willing having the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">courage to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">when we come together with others to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">actually bring that forth</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">and that can feel unknown too and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">sometimes the path to it can feel quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">overgrown</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">so there&#39;s a practice there of like what</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">works for each of us might be different</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">to rediscover that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">and you know often say to people what is</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">it that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">what is it that helps you feel truly</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">most alive you know and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">different things for different people</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">some it will be like having the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">intense conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">they&#39;re so in it that in a way they</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">forget themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">but they feel more themselves than ever</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">before and for another person it might</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">be when they just have those moments of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">dancing</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">without any self-concern or lying</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">on on the ground and just breathing</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.399" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">or i though the ways there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">as many as there are humans on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">planet so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:17.920" style="s2">i think it&#39;s much more to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">works for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">when do you feel most alive</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">most you without trying to be you</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">um when do you feel most at home and can</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">you start discerning within yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">between when you&#39;re in a way there and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">um and i think there&#39;s many many</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">spiritual practices and paths that have</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">discovered and shared and taught about</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">so i won&#39;t go into much more detail on</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">that for now</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:50.639" style="s2">i&#39;d like to also look at the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">capacities because</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.639" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">in my experience and those are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">like a big embrace like a big embrace to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.560" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">self and humanity right one is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">growing up the others growing out</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">and can we make that circle of care and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">concern and love</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:06.800" style="s2">wider and um and fuller both to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">ourselves and to others and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.800" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">a question that&#39;s been very alive for me</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">in this quest and i&#39;d say even more as</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve gotten older is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">is uh can we not just be intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">articulate and conscious and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">can we actually just be basically decent</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.199" style="s2">human beings and that&#39;s kind of what i</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">mean with the horizontal it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.199" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">what does it mean to show up as a decent</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">and then i&#39;ll often add how can we be</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">decent under duress because it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">thing to show up decent when the sun&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">shining and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">um all is well but how can we really</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">draw upon</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">qualities and values and ethics that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:48.480" style="s2">make a life well-lived when the going</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">like that which which um</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.980" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:08.880" style="s2">that which we build when we realize how</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">fragile how tender the human being</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.880" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">actually is like we have such thin skin</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.120" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">i&#39;m always amazed like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">we survived some of us survived like my</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">grandma became 100 and died last year</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">like she made it until then like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">absolute miracle</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.559" style="s2">when you think how fragile we really are</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">like it just takes a stick to poke at</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.559" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">you and you&#39;ve already got a dent in you</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">um but then also psychologically and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">we are fragile beings um and yet we also</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">claim and grow such sturdiness and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">resilience</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">so a question that i really think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">in in the in the sense of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">horizontal skills is how can you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">grow a an ego coat so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">lightweight so it&#39;s like a lightweight</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">coat rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">clunky armor knowing that yes we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">tender selves that when the going gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">rough when it&#39;s stormy outside we need</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">some protection so we build that outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.679" style="s2">but can it be a coat that you know has</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">pockets that has things in it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.679" end="00:19:08.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">completely bogged down with massive</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">amounts of fear</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">um and trauma and defense mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">reactions so</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">a lot of the work is to see where that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">coat has gotten clunky and has become</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">like armor and</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">to do the shadow work do the trauma work</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:30.640" style="s2">do the um self-awareness work of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">who am i what are my tendencies what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.640" end="00:19:36.160" style="s2">my type where do i tend to trip up</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">um how can i work in a complementary</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">fashion with others rather than in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">rivalrous one and and bringing</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">those horizontal and vertical skill sets</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">together really is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">i often talk about it as as if you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">of us like</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.760" style="s2">all like instruments you know one of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">might be a violin one a cello one a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">flute one a guitar etc</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.679" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">um if you think about the the work of</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.760" style="s2">coming together to give</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">rise to what&#39;s in our midst</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">then it&#39;s a bit like if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">play music with others</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">whether that&#39;s a duet or a trio or in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">band or an orchestra</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">if you were a musician which i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">some of you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">you would never stop playing music</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">together without first tuning your</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">instrument you just wouldn&#39;t and once</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">you stop playing</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">if you would notice by listening by</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">self-awareness right by being attuned by</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">listening that you&#39;re out of tune</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t continue you would actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:36.240" style="s2">you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">you see especially the violent lin</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.240" end="00:20:38.559" style="s2">players like they&#39;ll quickly do quick</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.600" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">tuning</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.559" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">um you so you would stop and then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">would re-tune and then you&#39;d play a game</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">and i i use this better for a lot when</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">working with couples because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">couples will just jam themselves into um</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">talking about something and get</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">completely out of tune or start out a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">tune</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">and be expecting to play music so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">there&#39;s something there about once we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">are working on our horizontal uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">horizontal and vertical capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">really integrating them so you know i do</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">come from a a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">integral perspective on life it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">resonated deeply with</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:19.120" style="s2">with the way i experience life is is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">grow in depth and width</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.120" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">um so to to hold both the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">and the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">and the physical ending and the social</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">and all these aspects</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:33.520" style="s2">um that they all are part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">us becoming well-tuned instruments and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.520" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">knowing that we float in and out of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">being in tune and out</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">of tune and that&#39;s completely fine so</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">another horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:47.919" style="s2">capacity is to meet and greet ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">and others with kindness and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">and forgiveness you know it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">i often say to my clients is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:55.520" style="s2">can we just go at this as if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">pre-forgiven</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.520" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">you know because because ultimately i</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">think we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">so can we actually go at</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">this with a vulnerability and a courage</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">and a resilience</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">understanding that because we&#39;re humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">it&#39;s already for sure that we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">make mistakes and trip</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">up and fall flat on our faces so if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">can just</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">assume we&#39;re pre-forgiven it can</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">actually allow us to take risks</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">and to um to in a way do the challenging</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">work of waking up</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">and and growing up but within a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s almost like within an</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">already embraced like within a vessel of</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.280" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">and deep thoughtfulness and great theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.080" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">this topic and before people</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">can even blink something can come from</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:19.120" style="s2">some shadow some trauma um</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">some deep hurt that just pops up and can</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.120" end="00:23:24.880" style="s2">literally just</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">destroy the whole effort so to to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.880" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">to not fool ourselves like we really</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">have to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">our psychological wellness</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">as much as our spiritual integrity</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">and uh and so i guess i want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">emphasize that in this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">so ask one more question uh start</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.799" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">putting your questions in the chat and i</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">will call</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">you in a moment so what was coming to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">mind um</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">so this place is called stala and no</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">one&#39;s a stoic here except me basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">so i&#39;m practicing stoic and one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">find with doing the stoic algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:05.039" style="s2">um engenders what i call a para egoic</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">state rather than like a trans egoic</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.039" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">state like some of the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">traditions are</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:11.279" style="s2">non-egoic where you feel your ego it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">right here but it&#39;s like on the side and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.279" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">you can still operate and be effective</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">um without it kind of like overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">you and co-opting</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">your behavior but if you just stay there</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">you you know you can become a sociopath</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">and i think a lot of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">trauma just</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">become stoic in that sense um without</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">any of that inner work uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">but i also like a most orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">christian eastern tradition</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">and they have a beautiful practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">called the jesus prayer and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">like you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">lord jesus christ son of god have mercy</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">on me a sinner and you focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">on the words coming out and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">kind of while still focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">words you focus on your mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:49.279" style="s2">and then you focus on your heart then</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">you drop your mind to your heart then</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.279" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">you focus on all three at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">and it really has a somatic effect and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">then you just basically unify them</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">uh what they what they call theosis um</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i get from the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.520" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">practice that you&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">so i&#39;m wondering um is there any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">like go-to practices you you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">in order to have kind of like a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">relationship with the ego and also have</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">that horizontal thing that like loving</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:15.440" style="s2">kindness or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">or do you think it&#39;s like has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.440" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">bespoke journey towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">each one of those things for for each</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">people or each person</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">i think having now worked for</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">over two decades as a therapist and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">and just you know been married for</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">longer than that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">and and just being a human for even</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">longer than that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">um i i think what&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:51.520" style="s2">is that we know the work is ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">that we understand that shadow is real</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.520" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:57.200" style="s2">find a way to uncover it and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">and transmute it</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:02.279" style="s2">that trauma is real that in my view</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:05.120" style="s2">there is no such thing as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.279" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">non-traumatized human</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">there&#39;s bigger larger deeper fuller ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">um and there are little jolts to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:13.840" style="s2">sensitive nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">um you know so and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.840" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">everything in between</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:23.120" style="s2">um we all come with tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">uh we all have a typology so getting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.120" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">know that is a really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">practice like just get to know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">know what are your likely</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">stumbling blocks what are your likely</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">brilliances</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">that kind of thing um</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">finding a way to connect with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.159" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">biggest context</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">possible is is another key piece</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">and for some that could be devotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">prayer for another it could be</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">meditation for another it could be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:56.159" style="s2">contemplation on death</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">um for another it could be being present</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">at birth</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">or just simply vulnerability can really</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">open up a door or beauty for me beauty</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:09.039" style="s2">is huge as far as context</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:11.520" style="s2">setting um so but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.039" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">so so the way the way to for others it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.520" end="00:27:15.840" style="s2">reading philosophical texts</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">but the the the way to that larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.840" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">context of like it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the remembering of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.159" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">what actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">matters and it&#39;s not that it all needs</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">to be big</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:28.640" style="s2">and huge and fancy because what matters</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">can happen in the stillness between you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.640" end="00:27:34.760" style="s2">and another or you and a dandelion</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:36.640" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.760" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.640" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">the the practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">within oneself of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">it&#39;s like building a sturdiness or</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">resilience so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">i&#39;m all for heist i am i have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">sensitivity as</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">i know that feeling like my skin feels</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">thin in this world and i find it quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">intense to be a human being</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">on this planet and the outside affects</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">me greatly and i think my insight</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:09.600" style="s2">you know comes out quite easily um so a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:11.279" style="s2">a practice around this whole how do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">become a decent human being that has</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">worked for me is to build sturdiness</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">to build resilience so rather than to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">then shut down because we feel so much</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">or because feeling so much is actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">part and parcel of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">being fully human rather than to create</p>

<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">can we actually grow a sturdiness from</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">and that then really touches on skills</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">be a trigger so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">if you can identify those and usually</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">triggers underneath them have unmet</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">needs and so once you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">trigger are you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">follow the tap route down find out</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">what&#39;s the need under it that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">being met</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">which then really is a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">diagnostic tool to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:16.240" style="s2">out now how can i soothe that when that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">trigger comes what do i actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.240" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">do to address it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">to allow myself to regulate so um</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s getting together i guess</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">like a toolkit that is both</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s psychos virtual and then i</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">obviously include the body in it too so</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to go in that i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the topic that has become</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">widespread now which is awesome but you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">know what do we feed our bodies what do</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:45.470" style="s2">we feed our minds what we feed our</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">hearts and souls all of that counts</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.470" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">i do think there&#39;s some very specific</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">are key when we want to lean into</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">the unknown together as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">from our authentic selves and one is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">intrapersonal so it&#39;s the discernment</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">within myself</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">of when am i residing more in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">outside social ego self</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">and when am i resting</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">home in literally in my soul in my</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">essence and to start knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">difference and even feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">somatically like we</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:28.159" style="s2">i always find it&#39;s funny how we theorize</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">about these things but</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.159" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">it really lives in the body like how</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">does my body feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">when i&#39;m um residing home</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">and and i&#39;ve noticed a lot with my</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">clients is just vocally so i&#39;m a singer</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">on the side and and so i pay a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">attention to voice and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:47.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed sometimes when my clients</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">come in when they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.039" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">centered when they&#39;re not grounded when</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re out of tune when</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">they&#39;re off</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">their voices are a lot higher uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">like a frenetic kind of energy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">during the session you&#39;ll often</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">the voice will will come down it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">start resting deep down in the chest um</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like even the voice comes home how</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:10.720" style="s2">does it feel in your chest</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.480" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">when you&#39;re home versus not so picking</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.720" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">up and getting really curious about any</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">of those clues that help you discern</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">which self am i bringing forward in any</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">moment and like you said</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">peter it&#39;s not about getting rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:24.000" style="s2">ego it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:25.600" style="s2">having right relationship with it so</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.000" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">that when it matters</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.600" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">you can lay it it&#39;s like you can just</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">gently put it to the side and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">you sit here like a little cat</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to work here on bringing</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">forward my</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">authentic me into the circle because</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">in all our study of this topic stefan my</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">husband and i that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">the the the key to coming together</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:50.880" style="s2">losing self and actually becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">yourself than</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.880" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">ever before so where distinction is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">maintained but separation is dissolved</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">the key to that is our authentic self</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">like when we&#39;re really home in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">who we are like that identity beyond</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">biography</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">that is the key to showing up in an</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">unrivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">all considerate sovereign fashion that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">yeah i love that um okay so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">pivot to</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">cool there&#39;s some so much good ones uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">let&#39;s go with steve you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">stefan uh steve henry about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">urgency of communitas</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">okay um i feel a sense of urgency that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">this is needed</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">right away and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">seems like what is that this takes time</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">this kind of development</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">and so i&#39;m wondering how</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.440" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">you cope with the sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">versus the time that&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">first um your heart your questions</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">touches my heart like i almost have</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">tears when i hear it because i live with</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">this question every single day</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">and i couldn&#39;t agree with you more i</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">think you know the funny thing is i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">been feeling</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">the urgency since my twenties and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">now in my early</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:32.399" style="s2">i&#39;m 51 and so it&#39;s been it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2">long haul of feeling the urgency and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.399" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.960" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna borrow some of my my husband</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">stefan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">theories around this because you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">having lived with him</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.519" style="s2">um it would be beautiful actually if he</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">was here i think he has felt</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.519" end="00:33:47.600" style="s2">this urgency since the day he was born</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:50.080" style="s2">so i just want to say i i</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.600" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">so get that feeling and i think the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.080" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">the world&#39;s going right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">it&#39;s it is becoming more and more i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">say important i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:05.279" style="s2">maybe going to move away from the word</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">urgent but pressing and important</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.279" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">that we can break through like i i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:10.879" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">feel like the future of humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.879" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">dependent on it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">so and at the same time like you said</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">yeah this is a long journey</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">however so partly i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.079" style="s2">skills we can acquire partly i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">about a journey of maturity so</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.079" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">there are i think more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">who have the capacity for what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.879" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">i still think we have sometimes one side</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">in this like there&#39;s people with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">of horizontal capacities</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">and but who haven&#39;t maybe developed so</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">much of their vertical</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:46.800" style="s2">um and and the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">at this point i&#39;d almost sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.800" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">prefer working with the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">elegant people um like to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">truly decent people because i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">coming home to self is is already</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">always there like we tend to make that</p>

<p begin="00:35:47.359" end="00:35:53.280" style="s2">and usually within a matter of seconds</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">every client i&#39;ve worked can find it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.280" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not far away</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.800" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">so when the container is safe when</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">uh the relationship the foundation of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">relationship feels like something you</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:11.040" style="s2">you can be vulnerable in and on</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">to to come home at least as a state</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.040" end="00:36:16.640" style="s2">is not hard to stay there</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">is where it takes that knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.640" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">inner discernment the commitment the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">will in a way the uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">the the remembering how important it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">to do that i think there are more and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">people who have the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">capacities i think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">that that coming home you can access</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">um and i actually you know i couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:38.800" style="s2">wrong on this</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">my husband and i could both be wrong on</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.800" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">this we talk about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;d say over 90 of humanity if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">could break through to some kind of sane</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.920" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">even if it&#39;s just a small collective</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">doing it at first</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">and start creating systems and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:59.359" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">from there over 90 of humanity would</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.359" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">easily happily glide into that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:07.359" style="s2">without having to do kind of the you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">know creating the groove</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.359" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">like most people are just</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.400" style="s2">wanting to live a good life and are</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">tired</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.400" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">of the rat race and this rivalrous thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">all get rid of the rivalrous nature that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">we are but there&#39;s i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">more and more people who feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.560" style="s2">that arc has kind of done its time we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">literally destroying ourselves at this</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.560" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">um so i in that sense i have hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">however and here i&#39;m going to borrow one</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:40.560" style="s2">of the theories of my husband because he</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.560" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">he&#39;s been hammering this for</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">into my my consciousness forever and</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s that those of us who have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">incredible privilege</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">and the the the education and the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">on our hands</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">and the literally all the gifts and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:07.040" style="s2">blessings to be able to sit in this call</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.040" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">rather than feeling like everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">just needs to catch up to us</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">what if we included that as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:20.800" style="s2">consideration but</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">if we put our focus onto onto moving</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.800" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">forwards like moving beyond what we</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">already know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">moving beyond what we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">comfortable with moving beyond</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">like literally sitting right at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">of the unknown becoming familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">sitting in uncertainty together where</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">all we bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">totally humbly is literally like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:39.920" style="s2">little offering bowl of here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">authentic self</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.920" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">and i&#39;m coming together with you and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:47.280" style="s2">in you and now let&#39;s see what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">and can we get comfortable to sit in</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.280" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">stillness</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.839" style="s2">until there&#39;s a nudge and impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">speak</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.839" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">through that little bowl um</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">you know so i i think i took a few</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:03.040" style="s2">little loops there but</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">the the idea is yes it&#39;s urgent</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.040" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">thinking that we need to somehow get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:08.400" style="s2">masses to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">place i don&#39;t think is realistic or</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.400" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">possible i think if we actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">um focused our focus</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">on moving that next it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">next step but it often feels like a leap</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s asking those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.400" style="s2">feeling that edge</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">to literally relinquish that which we</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">hold so dear and that we&#39;ve practiced</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">and polished so much all our entire</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">lives which is highly sophisticated ego</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.000" style="s2">cells that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">can talk spiritual and look spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.000" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">and convince pretty much anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">that you&#39;re intelligent and a marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">human being and you you probably are</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">but can we actually let go of of even</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">the thinnest</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:48.640" style="s2">veil that we&#39;re still holding and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">literally come humbly</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">into the circle with others um</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">and if that gives any answers i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.920" end="00:40:40.880" style="s2">wrap it up in what you just talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">in terms of holding a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.880" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">for those who are willing and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">and yet we run into and we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not aware of their own triggers</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">and of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s specific to when you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.800" style="s2">trauma</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">what kind of culture do we need to build</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">so that we can be very elegant</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:43.520" style="s2">with working with and through trauma</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">when it comes so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.520" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">trip up the incredibly important effort</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">of coming together</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:51.520" style="s2">um and how can you do that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">i borrow insights here from</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.520" end="00:41:57.760" style="s2">my work as a therapist which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">the rather than when trauma comes that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.760" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">everyone freezes around i was like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:03.200" style="s2">you know let&#39;s run the hills and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">whole thing falls apart which has</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.200" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">happened many many times</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">um rather than doing that and having</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:11.520" style="s2">sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.680" style="s2">mirrored freeze reaction from everyone</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.520" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">around in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.680" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">the the more i&#39;ll put it first with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">individual the more</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:22.160" style="s2">an individual can can live into being</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">pre-forgiven</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">and can step into trauma work</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">in an even larger vessel of love so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">like the bigger the love the more</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">possible to deal with trauma um</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">and we often think of love as something</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">on the other side or being connected</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.359" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">with self</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">or becoming unfrozen on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">so a big part of what i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">thinking as far as a culture that can do</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:52.000" style="s2">this elegantly</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">is can we marry what is often</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.000" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">um apart so can we</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">literally bring these incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">uh generous important capacities of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.390" style="s2">being pre-forgiven already loved</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:10.960" style="s2">safety</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.390" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.960" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">compassion the the notion that it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:18.079" style="s2">often talk about your ego my ego your</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">trauma my trauma what if we just put it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.079" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t so personalized because</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.160" style="s2">that would also help with bringing down</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:27.680" style="s2">some of the defense mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.160" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">then it&#39;s just like oh trauma has</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.680" end="00:43:30.960" style="s2">entered the space how are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">work with it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.960" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">susan&#39;s trauma just tripped us up or</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">miriam&#39;s trauma just did like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">how can we actually just work with or</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">ego patterns oh an ego patron just</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">floated through what are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">you know we&#39;re just going to ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">sometimes ignoring is great are we</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">going to just see it are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">work with it</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">so one is to in a way depersonalize like</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">bring it into the middle</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.319" end="00:43:58.000" style="s2">the other is to assure ourselves and one</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">another as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.000" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">that no matter what you are loved no</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.640" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">matter what i am loved</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">um because the times i have seen people</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">pull away when trauma happens is when</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">there is a lack</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">of there&#39;s a freakout basically there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:20.960" style="s2">connection and and feeling accepted and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">and seen and heard and sheltered and</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">embraced through it all</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a lot of shame then that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">comes in an embarrassment and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">um goes apart rather than stays</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">turned towards each other to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">like can we create a culture where</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">we don&#39;t get bogged down by this because</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">it can also become an</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">endless endless journey of just uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">psychological work</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">can we keep the the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">where we need to head as a human family</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:51.599" style="s2">sort of right at the four of our minds</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.599" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">and focus but when something comes</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:00.240" style="s2">can we have the skill to work with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">um i guess elegantly really like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">lovingly uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">where there&#39;s a there&#39;s an awareness for</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">these things for one thing so they can</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">be named</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a clear understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">what we do when it happens ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">um and that we do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t add in the secondary burdens of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">shame and embarrassment</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.319" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">uh i think that&#39;s really a huge piece</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:30.079" style="s2">so those those are some of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">i&#39;m you know i&#39;m working on this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.079" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">in my writing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">how can we create a culture of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">um and agreements that is conducive</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">to this kind of work happening where we</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">don&#39;t get tripped up because</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:45.599" style="s2">like i said i&#39;ve just seen too many</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">great efforts</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.599" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">sadly really just fall apart and i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">the time now more than ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:54.640" style="s2">is that we are smart about how we go</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">about this and so we know where the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.640" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">pitfalls are and we&#39;re prepared</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">to work with them um</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">yeah so i always say make the vessel</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">like it sounds maybe simplistic but when</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">you really put it into practice it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:09.359" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">it&#39;s quite incredible can you can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.359" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">always make love bigger than everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:13.280" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:15.520" style="s2">like if you&#39;re having a conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.280" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">your partner okay the conflict&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.520" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">you get the information from it you try</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">and tune in can you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:23.280" style="s2">just for a moment expand the context</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">make the love even bigger and ask</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.280" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">yourself what would love do in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:29.119" style="s2">and it might do something astonishing</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">like now&#39;s not a good time to talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.119" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">let&#39;s revisit this or i really need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">take a week just to consider something</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">or you know it doesn&#39;t always mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">diving in and being</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:41.839" style="s2">soft and warm it can actually mean also</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">what would love do can mean that i grow</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.839" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">ability within myself to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:49.280" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">like can i can i can i develop a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.280" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">capacity to handle</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">stress and regulate at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">in this way stay in the conversation can</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">i grow resilience to stay in rather than</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">have to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">as soon as the going gets hard um</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:09.680" style="s2">and this is where i think emotional</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">intelligence and wisdom are as important</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.680" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">as spiritual awakening</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:14.880" style="s2">i actually put them all in the same pot</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">but you know if you&#39;re going to tease</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.880" end="00:47:18.319" style="s2">them apart they&#39;re as important</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s one of my favorite quotes</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.800" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">i have no idea who said it but it lives</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.480" style="s2">on my fridge and it&#39;s like instead of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">waiting for the storm to pass can we</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.480" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">learn to dance in the rain</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">this is in a way what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">like can we stay</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">in the fire can we stay in the rain</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:39.280" style="s2">being kind and compassionate and</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">and loving enough so that we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:48.079" style="s2">in the rain rather than going okay</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">that&#39;s too much got to take a break</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.079" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">wait until the storm has passed</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">all right um maybe gray you had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:47:59.920" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.559" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">um yeah sorry i hope that my my mic is</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">working uh can everybody hear me okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">um so my question was about um i hear</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">you talk about like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">um like trying to locate this like deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:15.359" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">place where everything&#39;s okay and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.359" end="00:48:19.839" style="s2">feel at home um</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:21.520" style="s2">and i was just wondering like i know</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.839" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">that you say that for like 90</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.520" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">of the people it&#39;s easy um but i find</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">that a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not super easy for me um and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">i wonder about uh what what your advice</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">would be for</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">people like me or other people who have</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">maybe more difficult backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:39.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">get like to develop that deep down home</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.680" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">before how we can maybe discover it for</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">the first time or</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">or dig under whatever is burying it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">get at that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">yeah beautiful um i&#39;d like to start by</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">just saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">and i think it kind of swam in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">words it&#39;s never too late</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">um i&#39;m absolutely convinced of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">um we can always we can always find that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">wholeness because it it is there it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:06.720" style="s2">might be very tucked under but it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">so um healing is always possible and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">sometimes we have stories of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">attachment that was insecure or that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">fought with anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:19.359" style="s2">and difficulty that can make it much</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.640" style="s2">harder because we do live in these</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.359" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">bodies right</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.640" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">and in this emotional body and physical</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">body and mental and spiritual so</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">there&#39;s uh i i hear you and i think um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">this is where i sometimes have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">image of it&#39;s there for all of us that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:39.040" style="s2">your core self is is fully alive and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:41.680" style="s2">there but the</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.040" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">path to it can sometimes feel overgrown</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">you know almost like you got to get a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">machete out the first time and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">cut your way through</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">and then over time the more you come</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:51.599" style="s2">back there the path kind of gets made</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.000" style="s2">and then it does become easier</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.599" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">so in those kind of situations i feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.000" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">like working one-on-one with someone who</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">is skilled</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">in both the psychological and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">spiritual realm</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:05.200" style="s2">um and who is trauma informed and has a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">background in attachment</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.200" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">and childhood development um</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s what i would suggest um you</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:15.599" style="s2">know that that i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">is is the way because it it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.599" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s a journey and for some of us</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a quick easy access but you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">when i say clients find it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">within seconds usually these are clients</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:26.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve been working with for quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.079" end="00:50:31.839" style="s2">these topics we&#39;ve been talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:34.720" style="s2">i have to give some context to that also</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">yeah but to remember even sometimes i</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.720" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">change happens if we just start</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">imagining like that&#39;s why i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">imagination is such a beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">because if you can&#39;t imagine something</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to kind of step into</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">something new so just in in talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.000" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">about community tasks too i mean if</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:50.000" style="s2">there&#39;s one thing all of us could be</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:53.760" style="s2">doing is</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.000" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">use our creative intention and</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.760" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">imagination to keep imagining where</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">we&#39;re heading as a humanity</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">in its best version i actually think</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:05.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like parting some clouds so we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">actually start going there and see where</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">we&#39;re heading</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">um but on on the note of your question</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">even if you just begin with the smallest</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.720" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">little step</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">of can i can i just open the doors or</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">the windows of my imagination and just</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.240" end="00:51:26.800" style="s2">that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">some me some some self in me</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.800" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">that is actually whole can i just even</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">just stop</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">just with that that might be a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">awesome thank you so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.160" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">elf you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">thanks miriam uh my question was trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:49.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">get around how do you support communitas</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.920" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">in kind of a government&#39;s role a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:57.200" style="s2">when you deal with governance sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:58.960" style="s2">you just want certain things to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.200" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">and not trying to overly design</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.960" end="00:52:02.559" style="s2">logically ahead of times but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">without good governance a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.559" end="00:52:07.440" style="s2">communities implode</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">and then i just was in israel traveling</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.440" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">a bunch of kibbutz&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">and that was one of the patterns i</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:15.839" style="s2">noticed was this rigidity of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">and they had to become flexible over</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.839" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">time so they were stuck to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">communist ideology for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">and the environment forces</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">a shift and they looked at that as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">failure and i looked at that as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">oh you had to experiment and pivot</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">um but from their ideological view it</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">was a failure but anyway i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">the governance role i mean you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">start to touch on it with a culture and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">ethics i think it&#39;s related there but</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">um i actually like i i&#39;ve left just</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">listening to you because i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:44.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve held</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.480" style="s2">bits of the answer in what you were</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.240" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">saying um and maybe me just reflecting</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">back will</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">will make you notice that like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">one of the answers i would give that i</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">heard in what you&#39;re saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:59.200" style="s2">we think of governance in a as a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.440" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.200" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">thing rather than that it&#39;s ever fixed</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">true governance is is in a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.839" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">is governing in relationship to actual</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">reality like reality like with a big r</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">and i think a lot of what happens with</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.559" style="s2">governance is you come up with roles</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">and functions and it like you say it</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.559" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">gets sultified it gets very rigid</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">and as soon as it&#39;s gotten ridges it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">out of touch with what gave</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">rise to why this particular person held</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:31.200" style="s2">this role or this function</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">so to include in in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.200" end="00:53:34.880" style="s2">any kind of governance going forward</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.880" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">like tucked right into its very fabric</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">the that it does need to pivot and turn</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">and stay ideally um</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.480" style="s2">yeah in touch with reality on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:49.359" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:50.400" style="s2">is a huge thing so a it&#39;s dynamic by</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.359" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">um the other piece that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">is that governance that i think would</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:53:59.520" style="s2">work best</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">has a lot to do with right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.520" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">both right relationship with myself and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">with others like what what is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:07.440" style="s2">mine to do what&#39;s yours to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">you know having lived in community for</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.440" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">for 10 years we we realized very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:13.920" style="s2">that consensus decision making was not a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">governance tool that we wanted to employ</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.920" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">because it was a headache it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">can be a step along the way but you end</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">up sitting potentially in a circle for</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:23.760" style="s2">many hours and feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">you know the sun&#39;s going down soon and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.760" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">the garden really needs to get planted</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">and so we found that it made a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">to um notice who whose is it</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">to hold the overview of say the garden</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">and then to empower that person and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:41.599" style="s2">whoever was</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">flocking around that person to then go</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.599" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">do and yes check in report back</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:49.920" style="s2">get get feedback if needed but</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">to to to go with what&#39;s sometimes i</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.920" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">think the answers are actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">more simple than we think like we like</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">to make things incredibly complicated</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">uh and and i agree life is incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:02.559" style="s2">complex but can we</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">kind of like feel the the full</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.559" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">complexity and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">and then look through it and go is there</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">actually a simplicity on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s another piece that comes</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">to mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">around governance is what is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:19.760" style="s2">natural what just makes sense some</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:22.799" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.760" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">just naturally have um</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.799" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">overview they they just naturally have</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">overview they&#39;re not necessarily skilled</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:32.160" style="s2">in any little particular field</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">but they always have this meta</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.160" end="00:55:37.599" style="s2">perspective on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">um so someone like that would be much</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.599" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">more suited</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:44.160" style="s2">to project management or leadership</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">you know of the ship rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">particular room on the ship</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">and then you know this is i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">governance that we have not yet explored</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:57.359" style="s2">i think at the the edge of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:58.319" style="s2">possible would be a whole other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.359" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">governance which</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.319" end="00:56:02.400" style="s2">includes what i just said but it is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">in our humble authentic</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">selves that are unique and beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">distinct from each other but</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">not in that rival or separate separate</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.799" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.480" style="s2">coming together like that and in my</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.799" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.480" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">there actually is an other that can</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">enter</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">the space and what if what if that other</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:29.359" style="s2">that is made up</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">of the sum total of us gathered</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.359" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">and more what if that could actually be</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">ultimate governing</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">voice and we&#39;re in relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:46.319" style="s2">listening for what is each of ours to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">and because if if we could literally get</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.319" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">through that eye of the needle</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">like you know when you said comunitas</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">was uh was intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">right in that liminal space i have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">think of you theory like</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">you can get to the bottom of the u like</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">really get to like we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve emptied emptied emptied and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">just don&#39;t know and then you start to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:05.680" style="s2">listen for what&#39;s emergent</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">well what if what if governance could be</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.680" end="00:57:08.400" style="s2">listening for that</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">that which comes when we&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.400" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">together emptied to the bottom of the eu</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">and now we&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">we&#39;re listening from the future like i</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:21.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">we&#39;ve even begun to live what&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.200" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">as far as governance i think we just</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">have some clues around</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">i my clues like it needs to be evolution</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">it needs to it needs to make sense as in</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">be natural but it needs to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">change at a moment&#39;s notice etc</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">thank you all right beautiful um</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">so we are at the hour um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">probably wise to close out here um</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">miriam do you have any closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">for us or anything that came alive for</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">you uh throughout today&#39;s session</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.040" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">uh probably just my enjoyment of hanging</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">out with you all</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s been just lovely and seeing a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">few of the faces</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">and and uh and you holding the space</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:02.559" style="s2">like this peter and the inquiry like i</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.920" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">heartened really i feel heartened to</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.920" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">know that you all exist and that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:11.440" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">about this topic and that um</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.440" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">because it can feel so daunting so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:19.280" style="s2">gather my heartedness with hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">some of yours</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.280" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">and put it in the middle and just remind</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:25.599" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:26.319" style="s2">all this is not a time to give up this</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.599" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">is a time</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.319" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">to keep at this like those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:35.839" style="s2">that this is important that you know are</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">broken and cracked open by what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.839" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">on around the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:41.359" style="s2">but um like just i guess i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:43.520" style="s2">say let&#39;s all take heart</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.359" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">let&#39;s not give up uh we&#39;ve got to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">this we really do like i</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">we start thinking about the future and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">future generations and the children just</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">being born</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like we can do this and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:58.240" style="s2">and if we can remember that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.839" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">easier than we think</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:04.480" style="s2">like not like hard but easy or let&#39;s say</p>
