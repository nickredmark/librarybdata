<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what is gonna be about but</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">it felt right to do so and we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:21.180" style="s2">just figured it out what to do before</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.259" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">about this thing called the de mons and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">then this is provocative saying like</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">emancipate the daemon what was he</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:40.409" style="s2">talking about there so Raven is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:42.180" style="s2">ask me some questions to kind of flesh</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.409" end="00:01:44.969" style="s2">out some of my thoughts because I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.180" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">you know good questions to be fleshed</p>

<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:06.750" style="s2">intention that I&#39;m going in with is sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">of fleshing out what I am sensing into</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.750" end="00:02:12.570" style="s2">this project is about of the stoah and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:15.620" style="s2">the day one so that thing said I&#39;ll hand</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.110" end="00:02:29.630" style="s2">letter and you were talking about coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.670" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">into your service ISM and bringing forth</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.630" end="00:02:36.050" style="s2">this message of emancipating</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:38.360" style="s2">the daemon can you just begin by setting</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.050" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">the stage for what that means to you and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.360" end="00:02:42.280" style="s2">how you&#39;re thinking about it right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:45.819" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.280" end="00:02:49.099" style="s2">yeah to speak in the simplest language</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.819" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a I understand the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.099" end="00:02:56.360" style="s2">daemon is like a quality of intuition</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:58.580" style="s2">that makes you feel most alive if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.360" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">follow it and if you listen to it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.580" end="00:03:02.780" style="s2">there&#39;s like a rightness to it as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:04.700" style="s2">but there&#39;s also great on knowingness</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.780" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">because you don&#39;t know if you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.700" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">good things are gonna happen there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:11.930" style="s2">a guarantee and every time I followed</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:13.610" style="s2">this sort of energy in my life I felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.930" end="00:03:16.220" style="s2">like an adventure and good things</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.610" end="00:03:17.510" style="s2">happened and this whole project for like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.220" end="00:03:19.910" style="s2">a month I&#39;ve been running on day one</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.510" end="00:03:23.209" style="s2">energy and you know just feels I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.910" end="00:03:25.510" style="s2">use a word but you know delicious and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.209" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it just feels really really right</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.510" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">but every time I noticed in the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:32.600" style="s2">when I broke up with this energy with</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">this Dame on is when the ego kicked in I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.600" end="00:03:38.390" style="s2">got insecure I want to control things</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">and whatnot and I&#39;m noticed in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.390" end="00:03:43.489" style="s2">space if you kind of like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:46.160" style="s2">relationship with this energy in</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.489" end="00:03:47.750" style="s2">yourself you can see in other people and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.160" end="00:03:50.450" style="s2">then you can double click on their Dame</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.750" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">one I mean so AJ you know he double</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.450" end="00:03:58.370" style="s2">clicked on his Damon with his events</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:04:00.410" style="s2">with you know Tyson with yourself sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.370" end="00:04:02.269" style="s2">of just kind of finding what what energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.410" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">makes you most alive and then give</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:07.130" style="s2">people an opportunity to give that gift</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:09.170" style="s2">and I like the idea this is all this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.130" end="00:04:10.639" style="s2">being stumbled upon too but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.170" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">notion of the gift economy which I got</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.639" end="00:04:15.380" style="s2">to Andrew at a guard it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:17.479" style="s2">can have that healthy relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.380" end="00:04:19.639" style="s2">the Dame on put aside the ego and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.479" end="00:04:22.760" style="s2">run with it you will be giving your</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.639" end="00:04:23.960" style="s2">greatest gift to the world and I could</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.760" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">be wrong about that but there&#39;s feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.960" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">of certainty there when I say it</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.280" end="00:04:32.310" style="s2">yeah I think there&#39;s other this other</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.050" style="s2">thing that you brought up that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.310" end="00:04:39.060" style="s2">introduced meeting you and your letter</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.050" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">was the notice year and in connection</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.060" end="00:04:43.440" style="s2">with this idea of memetic tribes and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:45.090" style="s2">there&#39;s these campfires that are being</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.440" end="00:04:46.919" style="s2">list right now these digital campfires</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.090" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">and it seems like the stoah has been</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.919" end="00:04:55.169" style="s2">playing a large role in kind of blowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:04:57.240" style="s2">oxygen into those fires and I see you</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.169" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">making this connection between between</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.240" end="00:05:06.599" style="s2">that and mimetic tribes and you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:08.129" style="s2">little bit more yeah sure so Dan said no</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.599" end="00:05:11.069" style="s2">mysterious it&#39;s a motor spear like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.129" end="00:05:13.409" style="s2">motion motor sphere and a book once that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.069" end="00:05:15.180" style="s2">for a moment but one thing I noticed and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.409" end="00:05:18.509" style="s2">like Collin Morris is a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.180" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2">this so me and Collins chatted you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.509" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">we came up with the term existential</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:23.250" style="s2">dance party because I knew he was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:24.960" style="s2">dancer and then we can I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.250" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">invite him in and then the accidental</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:27.690" style="s2">dance parties were just our freaking hit</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.449" style="s2">you were there at the first one I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.690" end="00:05:33.060" style="s2">Raven and and then you know I encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.449" end="00:05:35.069" style="s2">Collin to start his own digital campfire</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.060" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">his own like a digital dance studio</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.069" end="00:05:38.490" style="s2">where he&#39;s inviting all these people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s the same model as a stole off a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.490" end="00:05:41.610" style="s2">stop a gifticon to me he&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:42.990" style="s2">steward or whatever similar world he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.610" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">talking about he has a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.990" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">scylla taters in the space and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:49.289" style="s2">everyone is getting their gift right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:51.990" style="s2">so this it&#39;s this campfire the flames</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.289" end="00:05:53.699" style="s2">spread through new campfire and like</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.990" end="00:05:55.860" style="s2">you&#39;re you and I were talking and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.699" end="00:05:58.259" style="s2">gonna do a series of both questions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.860" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">abstractions and then the podcast might</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.259" end="00:06:03.240" style="s2">emerge from that and then you might have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">your own digital campfire you know other</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.240" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">people a Tyson</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:08.879" style="s2">rheya you know they could find a home</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:10.590" style="s2">here so that&#39;s like a prote like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.879" end="00:06:12.719" style="s2">incubator for different cyclic</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.590" end="00:06:14.819" style="s2">technologies I see this the stoah and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.719" end="00:06:17.969" style="s2">then campfires can emerge and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.819" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">people can give their gift to it and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.969" end="00:06:21.659" style="s2">had this vision where it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">just seeing the collective mind and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.659" end="00:06:25.289" style="s2">these campfire is emerging and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">that the essence is you light yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.289" end="00:06:28.440" style="s2">on fire</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:32.039" style="s2">then you like the campfire then you find</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.440" end="00:06:33.779" style="s2">the others and then you know I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.039" end="00:06:35.009" style="s2">say then you set the burn</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.779" end="00:06:38.669" style="s2">the down but you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.009" end="00:06:40.889" style="s2">lovingly lovingly yeah I mean it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.669" end="00:06:41.670" style="s2">incredible process of bringing more and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.889" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">more people</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.670" end="00:06:46.050" style="s2">into their leadership and their social</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:48.420" style="s2">connections coming and and catching that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.050" end="00:06:52.350" style="s2">fire from them and then spreading and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.420" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like a mimetic virus but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.350" end="00:06:56.970" style="s2">also think something that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:06:58.830" style="s2">talking about in your letters and coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.970" end="00:07:01.590" style="s2">up in the stoah is these practices of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.830" end="00:07:03.330" style="s2">embodiment yes can you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.590" end="00:07:06.630" style="s2">more about that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.330" end="00:07:08.460" style="s2">so you mentioned the motifs fear I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.630" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">back to that one so there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.460" end="00:07:11.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a geosphere and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:14.280" style="s2">biosphere emerged and then they say then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.640" end="00:07:15.270" style="s2">the noosphere emerged and then let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.280" end="00:07:16.950" style="s2">to talk about the biosphere in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:18.930" style="s2">noosphere the biosphere is where you</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.950" end="00:07:21.210" style="s2">know genes operate and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.930" end="00:07:23.370" style="s2">noosphere or collective consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.210" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">where like the memes but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.370" end="00:07:28.610" style="s2">something in the middle of the Emoto</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:30.540" style="s2">sphere were of the realm of emotionality</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.610" end="00:07:32.100" style="s2">and this is why I always do check-ins</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.540" end="00:07:34.620" style="s2">when I when I start with this dough I</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.100" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">just ground myself in in the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.620" end="00:07:40.020" style="s2">the moment and I think what culture were</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:41.880" style="s2">2.0 my analysis there was that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.020" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">was being like all these nomadic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.880" end="00:07:45.240" style="s2">attached to their propositions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">just fighting amongst each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.240" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">can&#39;t win a culture war just doing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.070" end="00:07:51.510" style="s2">right there&#39;s this embodiment there and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">I think AJ would like this the guy</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.510" end="00:07:54.870" style="s2">interviewed Sam back then who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:56.790" style="s2">that the narcissist narcissist he says</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.870" end="00:08:00.420" style="s2">we&#39;re going to we&#39;re entering a religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.790" end="00:08:02.130" style="s2">of narcissism and if you if you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.420" end="00:08:03.600" style="s2">about it the religion of narcissism is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.130" end="00:08:05.160" style="s2">an ecumenical religion because all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.600" end="00:08:06.780" style="s2">mathematic tries probably belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.160" end="00:08:10.410" style="s2">if they&#39;re you go CLE attach their</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.780" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">propositions in the disembodied so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.410" end="00:08:13.140" style="s2">ideas once all these digital campfires</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.180" style="s2">start burning</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.140" end="00:08:17.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like those mimetic tribes will sink</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.180" end="00:08:18.480" style="s2">to the becoming body tribes and how does</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.910" end="00:08:22.890" style="s2">that happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.480" end="00:08:24.150" style="s2">culture stealing the culture has jumper</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.890" end="00:08:27.410" style="s2">Vicki said in one of the sessions here</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.150" end="00:08:32.280" style="s2">and I think we have to steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.410" end="00:08:33.990" style="s2">as culture that&#39;s in service of ego it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.280" end="00:08:35.610" style="s2">not healthy if you create cultural</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.990" end="00:08:39.240" style="s2">artifacts that just serve your own ego</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.610" end="00:08:40.710" style="s2">then ya know but if you have a culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">that keeps ego in check</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">via communitas I think that&#39;s the key</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">and I think there could be many many</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">variations about it it could be through</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:51.090" style="s2">dance it could be through education it</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:54.450" style="s2">could be through freestyle it can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.090" end="00:08:55.170" style="s2">through philosophy but I think the move</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:08:57.060" style="s2">has to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.170" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">in order to steal the culture is to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.060" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">convert mimetic tribes to embody tribes</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.410" end="00:09:09.990" style="s2">very powerful um yeah the the question</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.500" end="00:09:14.910" style="s2">that&#39;s coming up for me right now is how</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.990" end="00:09:18.060" style="s2">do we how do we participate with our</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.910" end="00:09:21.209" style="s2">egos in a way that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.060" end="00:09:23.940" style="s2">emancipate our daemon without turning</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.209" end="00:09:28.350" style="s2">into the shadow without actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.940" end="00:09:29.540" style="s2">releasing demons into the world this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.350" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">at the edge of my thinking right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.540" end="00:09:38.339" style="s2">some wonder if you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:40.199" style="s2">that well I mean I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.339" end="00:09:45.300" style="s2">getting at something when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.199" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">embodied practices and communitas but</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.300" end="00:09:48.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a high degree of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:50.490" style="s2">that people have to already be bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.060" end="00:09:54.630" style="s2">and something that I&#39;m seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.490" end="00:09:58.529" style="s2">you&#39;re actually maybe the daemon is</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.630" end="00:10:01.649" style="s2">working through you in a way is feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.529" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">this kind of excitement for others and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.649" end="00:10:05.820" style="s2">the double clicking process of taking</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:09.300" style="s2">that excitement and something that could</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.820" end="00:10:11.730" style="s2">be turned into an egoic yes perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.300" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">and like these are my people or they</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.730" end="00:10:16.890" style="s2">make me cool or they&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.470" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">for me and actually inviting them to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.890" end="00:10:23.459" style="s2">their gift it&#39;s taking that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">bringing it forth and then that invites</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.459" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">someone else to do the very same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:30.269" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s it I find it kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:32.459" style="s2">spiritual practice because you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.269" end="00:10:34.199" style="s2">won&#39;t be shy like I want you to stay at</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.459" end="00:10:36.510" style="s2">the store I want AG to stay at the store</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.199" end="00:10:38.190" style="s2">you know I want to like I want to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.510" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">them all I want to stay them here but no</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.190" end="00:10:41.069" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not that&#39;s not they</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:42.870" style="s2">won&#39;t be giving their gift fully if</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.069" end="00:10:47.010" style="s2">that&#39;s the case just sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.870" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">launching pad that for them to to give</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.010" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">their gift to the world I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:54.209" style="s2">the right move and then seeing that grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:55.829" style="s2">is quite beautiful I&#39;m moved by it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.209" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">then it&#39;s caught as a constant process</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.829" end="00:11:00.329" style="s2">of just letting go of the ego too</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:01.500" style="s2">because like you said it&#39;s patches or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.329" end="00:11:03.690" style="s2">whatever like these are like could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.500" end="00:11:05.640" style="s2">mongrel terms and sloppy like ego Damon</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.690" end="00:11:07.990" style="s2">but I think people get what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.640" end="00:11:10.540" style="s2">gesturing at</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.990" end="00:11:12.580" style="s2">yeah I think the other thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.540" end="00:11:16.270" style="s2">is that you&#39;ve been so transparent about</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.580" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">this process and so just available and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.270" end="00:11:19.510" style="s2">it open about how you&#39;ve been moving</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.800" end="00:11:22.260" style="s2">through these arcs and the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.510" end="00:11:24.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve been learning is that part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.260" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">emancipating the daemon you think is</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.700" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">bringing yourselves forth authentically</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:32.649" style="s2">and talking about how we&#39;re wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">with these changes yes so I think what</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.649" end="00:11:35.800" style="s2">happened - I was talking to Steven</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:38.110" style="s2">Jenkinson who&#39;s a Canadian kind of poet</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.800" end="00:11:40.420" style="s2">on death work and that&#39;s sort of when</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.110" end="00:11:42.540" style="s2">the first kind of like I got a state</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.420" end="00:11:45.630" style="s2">shift because he was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.540" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">basically if you stop being truthful</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.630" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">then you start trying when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.940" style="s2">and lie you start trying to control the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:54.339" style="s2">minions that you&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.940" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">control and then a dis-ease will spread</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.339" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">through the world and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:00.430" style="s2">you talking about covin all that type of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:02.380" style="s2">stuff and yeah that&#39;s right and so it</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.430" end="00:12:06.610" style="s2">became an ethical act for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.380" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">radically truthful and I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.610" end="00:12:11.230" style="s2">truthfulness muscle is kind of fused to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:12.790" style="s2">the damn one right now so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.230" end="00:12:13.750" style="s2">saying what wants to be said but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.790" end="00:12:15.790" style="s2">saying it with the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.750" end="00:12:17.290" style="s2">truthfulness but it feels quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.790" end="00:12:21.970" style="s2">dangerous because it puts you at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.290" end="00:12:23.380" style="s2">knife edge on a lot of fronts yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.970" end="00:12:26.200" style="s2">there also seems to be this element of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.380" end="00:12:28.089" style="s2">uncertainty that you&#39;re acting before</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.200" end="00:12:31.630" style="s2">you have a certainty about whether or</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.089" end="00:12:35.649" style="s2">not the outcome is what you intend it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.630" end="00:12:37.959" style="s2">be for what you want and do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.649" end="00:12:40.120" style="s2">that the daemon energy actually allows</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.959" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">for that to happen and how do we invite</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.120" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">that in how do we like let ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.379" style="s2">be at the night&#39;s edge and still make</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.920" style="s2">decisions that have real world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.379" end="00:12:52.329" style="s2">implications yeah I think one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.920" end="00:12:54.009" style="s2">coming up there&#39;s just kind of now I</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.329" end="00:12:55.749" style="s2">think if more of us are at the knife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.009" end="00:12:58.410" style="s2">edge you&#39;ll be easier to be there</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.749" end="00:13:03.370" style="s2">because we can support each other</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.410" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">communitas and there&#39;s a balance like</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:53.649" style="s2">well I think especially since the gift</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.050" end="00:14:06.279" style="s2">has been coming in and out of lots of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.920" end="00:14:08.709" style="s2">conversations and themes and be</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.279" end="00:14:11.529" style="s2">integrated embodied through a practice</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.709" end="00:14:14.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of taking questioning as</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.529" end="00:14:18.370" style="s2">an abstraction as a way of like sorting</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.620" end="00:14:21.670" style="s2">and cutting pieces of reality into</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.370" end="00:14:23.139" style="s2">categories is a level that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.670" end="00:14:24.970" style="s2">understand it in an abstract sense but</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.139" end="00:14:26.649" style="s2">to begin to practice the act of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.970" end="00:14:28.809" style="s2">questioning and then to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.649" end="00:14:30.939" style="s2">meta side of it to be like oh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.809" end="00:14:32.800" style="s2">this question and I&#39;m attached to but</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.939" end="00:14:36.189" style="s2">actually the depression behind that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.800" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">which is what question is should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.189" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">asked like what should be good given</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:44.230" style="s2">yeah and I know it&#39;s just like a fool</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:45.459" style="s2">arising in me right now so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.230" end="00:14:46.480" style="s2">people are saying like walk eh you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.459" end="00:14:52.360" style="s2">more rest you should do this you should</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.480" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">do that and I&#39;m like why and then the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.360" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">question that comes out for me when</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">people are saying that like can you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:15:00.850" style="s2">measure wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:04.089" style="s2">can wisdom be measured and if the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.850" end="00:15:06.279" style="s2">question is the the foundation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.089" end="00:15:09.220" style="s2">like wise old Socrates says can you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.279" end="00:15:13.679" style="s2">measure the most effective question I</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.220" end="00:15:16.449" style="s2">don&#39;t think so so what do you rely on</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.679" end="00:15:18.519" style="s2">and if you you know you read your Plato</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.449" end="00:15:22.149" style="s2">Socrates relied on his Dale on his</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.519" end="00:15:23.889" style="s2">guiding spirit so and eudaimonia the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.149" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">Greek word but people translate for</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.889" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2">happiness is having a good relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:33.759" style="s2">with your Damon good ammonia so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:37.480" style="s2">think having the good the right question</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.759" end="00:15:40.449" style="s2">is the foundation but with you ask the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.480" end="00:15:43.089" style="s2">question without wanting anything in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.449" end="00:15:44.559" style="s2">way without trying to engineer without</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.089" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">trying to manipulate without trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.559" end="00:15:50.050" style="s2">control you just asked the question that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">wants to be asked and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.050" end="00:15:55.899" style="s2">foundation yes it&#39;s like a bringing</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.699" style="s2">together of like the questioning or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.899" end="00:16:00.220" style="s2">ability to like give voice to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.699" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">invisible and bringing it down into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.220" end="00:16:06.220" style="s2">intuitive so that you can like speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">from your truth speaks for your</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.220" end="00:16:11.709" style="s2">intellect but be coming from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:13.749" style="s2">truthfulness and right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.709" end="00:16:16.389" style="s2">that Damon energy that doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.749" end="00:16:21.069" style="s2">know before it does you know that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.389" end="00:16:22.929" style="s2">just do yes yeah and and with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.069" end="00:16:25.209" style="s2">subjective questions we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.929" end="00:16:29.699" style="s2">really good questions coming in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.209" end="00:16:29.699" style="s2">I just jump in because I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t like how the session is going</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.320" end="00:16:35.190" style="s2">and I think this is the right way but if</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:36.990" style="s2">this is going to be a weekly thing I</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.190" end="00:16:38.400" style="s2">kind of like the idea I don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.990" end="00:16:40.680" style="s2">to be a freaking Peter show that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.400" end="00:16:42.870" style="s2">last thing I want it to be right I want</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.680" end="00:16:44.460" style="s2">us all in this together figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.870" end="00:16:46.830" style="s2">to emancipate the Dame one not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.460" end="00:16:48.390" style="s2">ourselves but everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.830" end="00:16:50.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s my hope for these sessions I</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.390" end="00:16:51.660" style="s2">just I just you know I don&#39;t usually</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.130" end="00:16:53.100" style="s2">take the spotlight but I think that felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.660" end="00:16:54.390" style="s2">right right now taking it that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.100" end="00:16:59.880" style="s2">think I was a little bit nervous coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.390" end="00:17:02.190" style="s2">into this session yeah that&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.880" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">be in the spotlight it&#39;s I would just</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.190" end="00:17:08.939" style="s2">say and to respond to that that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:11.310" style="s2">your emancipation of your Damon has very</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.939" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">much helped emancipate mine and I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.310" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">see it doing that with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.900" end="00:17:17.670" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredible experience to be with</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:22.100" style="s2">this community where we&#39;re really rising</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.670" end="00:17:24.839" style="s2">up into our like possible selves and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.100" end="00:17:30.840" style="s2">through communitas like their community</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.839" end="00:17:32.670" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s very uncanny that we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:35.430" style="s2">come together intuitively and do this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.670" end="00:17:37.890" style="s2">right now and when I hear that you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.430" end="00:17:42.560" style="s2">sort of like almost tears are welling up</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.890" end="00:17:42.560" style="s2">and just felt really good hearing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.550" end="00:17:58.110" style="s2">are you ready for questions all right</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.820" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">thank you for doing this Peter let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.110" end="00:18:06.540" style="s2">if I could find my question here okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:09.270" style="s2">does I read many many a long time ago I</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.540" end="00:18:13.370" style="s2">read Hermann Hesse&#39;s Damian and I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.270" end="00:18:16.740" style="s2">wondering if this concept of Damon or</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.370" end="00:18:20.310" style="s2">diamond or eudaimonia relates in any way</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.740" end="00:18:23.250" style="s2">to the from what I remember there was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.310" end="00:18:26.910" style="s2">sort of this female character in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.250" end="00:18:30.330" style="s2">story that he kept recognizing or seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.910" end="00:18:33.540" style="s2">and was attracted to and was following</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.330" end="00:18:35.310" style="s2">and I got somehow the sense that this</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.540" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">was somehow related to the Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.310" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">concept of this was the the anima the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.920" style="s2">female spirit within his male spirit or</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:45.900" style="s2">something like this this may</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.920" end="00:18:48.030" style="s2">my own projection and I&#39;m wondering have</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.900" end="00:18:50.220" style="s2">any thoughts yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.030" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">great um that&#39;s my favorite book of all</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.220" end="00:18:54.510" style="s2">time I was addicted to Hermann Hesse her</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:18:56.430" style="s2">HESA when I was younger and I probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.510" end="00:19:00.750" style="s2">that was a book I read most my whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.430" end="00:19:02.730" style="s2">life is Damian yeah I didn&#39;t like I got</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.750" end="00:19:04.980" style="s2">to read it again because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.730" end="00:19:06.990" style="s2">remember like he was talking with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.980" end="00:19:11.550" style="s2">animal there but it makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.990" end="00:19:18.650" style="s2">now that that he was see I have a deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.550" end="00:19:18.650" style="s2">connection with that that book thank you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.120" end="00:19:26.910" style="s2">all right next question from Dominus</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.510" end="00:19:35.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a question maybe a statement but</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:36.900" style="s2">you can share your statement - hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.060" end="00:19:39.450" style="s2">listening to you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.900" end="00:19:45.480" style="s2">emancipating Damon I hope everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.450" end="00:19:48.800" style="s2">hear me I woke up to something with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.480" end="00:19:52.890" style="s2">question of how to emancipate the daemon</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.800" end="00:19:57.030" style="s2">without waking up demons I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.890" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2">you can do it I think you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.030" end="00:20:00.350" style="s2">because the demons will always be part</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:02.610" style="s2">of you and they&#39;re part of your strength</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.350" end="00:20:05.370" style="s2">they&#39;re like your shadow you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.610" end="00:20:08.370" style="s2">integrate them you have to invite them</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.370" end="00:20:10.200" style="s2">to the campfire - just like we would</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.370" end="00:20:12.690" style="s2">have invited wolves wolves to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.200" end="00:20:17.190" style="s2">campfire and tamed the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.690" end="00:20:19.380" style="s2">fear in them to our own service if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.190" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">ignore them or fear them and make</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.380" end="00:20:24.120" style="s2">enemies of those parts of yourself they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">just move into the basement of your soul</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.120" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">and start lifting weights</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:37.100" style="s2">well-put I can&#39;t take credit for that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:39.470" style="s2">when that was Amanda Palmer could you uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.100" end="00:20:41.880" style="s2">send that to me I really love that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.470" end="00:20:43.350" style="s2">absolutely absolutely she said it in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.880" end="00:20:44.430" style="s2">interview with Tim Ferriss it was very</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.350" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">good that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.430" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">yeah yeah and I agree my experience</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.340" style="s2">recently is that if you follow the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:20:54.630" style="s2">Dame on it puts you at the knife&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.340" end="00:20:56.610" style="s2">and then you start meeting demons and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.630" end="00:20:57.230" style="s2">can talk about the whole demon concept</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.610" end="00:20:58.910" style="s2">and more sex</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.230" end="00:21:00.590" style="s2">their terms - don&#39;t forget all Christian</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.910" end="00:21:01.910" style="s2">but like my therapist was Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.590" end="00:21:05.179" style="s2">Peterson so like I kind of go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.910" end="00:21:06.530" style="s2">Christian mythology sometimes and it</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.179" end="00:21:09.590" style="s2">seems like there&#39;s a grammar there that</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.530" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">that&#39;s works somewhat and I&#39;m realizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.590" end="00:21:13.610" style="s2">that if you&#39;re at the knife&#39;s edge and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:17.299" style="s2">then you encounter these demons you very</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.610" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">well better be virtuous are they</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.299" end="00:21:21.350" style="s2">gonna get you so it&#39;s like opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:23.030" style="s2">to practice your virtue and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.350" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">sort of like you know perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.030" end="00:21:32.240" style="s2">opportunity practice my stoicism thanks</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">for that that was amazing yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.240" end="00:21:37.490" style="s2">think that&#39;s feels really right that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:39.410" style="s2">when you emancipate your daemon the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.490" end="00:21:42.290" style="s2">demons show up - and you have to face</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.410" end="00:21:44.270" style="s2">the shadow and maybe then the wrong move</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.290" end="00:21:47.990" style="s2">that has been made over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.270" end="00:21:50.660" style="s2">over again is to turn away from those</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.990" end="00:21:53.080" style="s2">things and then like you said they just</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:56.240" style="s2">grow stronger in the basement and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.080" end="00:21:58.610" style="s2">forgotten dreams and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.240" end="00:22:00.290" style="s2">how so much mythology I think has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.610" end="00:22:02.510" style="s2">coming up and here and I have been kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.290" end="00:22:05.090" style="s2">of exchanging stories like talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.510" end="00:22:07.549" style="s2">how Orpheus has to go down to Hades to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.090" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">recover you&#39;re rid of seeds and yet his</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.549" end="00:22:12.650" style="s2">like shadow comes his doubt and he looks</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.100" end="00:22:14.870" style="s2">back at her and the thing that he</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.650" end="00:22:18.200" style="s2">desired most that he liked sacrificed</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.870" end="00:22:21.669" style="s2">himself to go and recover his lost</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.200" end="00:22:25.880" style="s2">forever you know there&#39;s so many stories</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.669" end="00:22:28.100" style="s2">but talk about this this like power that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.880" end="00:22:31.340" style="s2">that&#39;s and also investing like I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.100" end="00:22:35.990" style="s2">the idea of the anima or like the figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.340" end="00:22:38.540" style="s2">of the woman who draws you beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.990" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">hesitation and emancipates you and gets</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.540" end="00:22:44.570" style="s2">you to act beyond what you know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:46.490" style="s2">will happen and then all of the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.570" end="00:22:48.350" style="s2">that kind of comes from that and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.490" end="00:22:53.059" style="s2">virtue that you need to actually make it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.350" end="00:22:55.220" style="s2">through experience that all just came up</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.059" end="00:22:57.650" style="s2">and what you were saying and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.220" end="00:23:00.679" style="s2">great that&#39;s great that also to share</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.650" end="00:23:03.049" style="s2">yeah thanks man I really appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.679" end="00:23:04.580" style="s2">I also recommend checking out Zak</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.049" end="00:23:06.230" style="s2">Stein&#39;s article and he came under still</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.580" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">to talk about it war broke out in heaven</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.230" end="00:23:11.779" style="s2">and hell</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">I think which is related we have another</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.779" end="00:23:25.250" style="s2">question from Khalil</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.740" end="00:24:25.909" style="s2">house to act like and then I and I had</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.230" end="00:24:27.500" style="s2">this kind of like existential breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.909" end="00:24:29.809" style="s2">like wow I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.500" end="00:24:31.610" style="s2">with my life you know like 35 years old</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.809" end="00:24:32.899" style="s2">I don&#39;t have my life I read every single</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.610" end="00:24:34.909" style="s2">philosopher looking at the hands on all</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.899" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">these self-help books spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.909" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">practices nothing and then there&#39;s Jason</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:41.390" style="s2">thought that occurred there is like huh</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:44.210" style="s2">no one else knows how to live my life</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.390" end="00:24:45.590" style="s2">either right and so how do I get into</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.210" end="00:24:47.899" style="s2">right relationship with not knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.590" end="00:24:49.159" style="s2">to live my life and then that judgment</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.899" end="00:24:51.380" style="s2">always there if not only hell live my</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.159" end="00:24:53.090" style="s2">life just kind of like just disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.380" end="00:24:55.130" style="s2">I&#39;m like huh you know this day one</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.090" end="00:24:56.179" style="s2">energy that keeps coming back it might</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.130" end="00:25:01.820" style="s2">have something so I just basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.179" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">handed the keys over to it yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.820" end="00:25:07.190" style="s2">that sort of so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:08.980" style="s2">go anytime soon but yeah I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.190" end="00:25:14.840" style="s2">afraid if it doesn&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.980" end="00:25:16.920" style="s2">if if I could just ask a follow-up like</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.840" end="00:25:19.920" style="s2">I noticed like when</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.920" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">this topic comes up or the idea of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.920" end="00:25:25.800" style="s2">vulnerable comes up my I could feel my</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:28.920" style="s2">body like tingling or shaking a bit I</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.800" end="00:25:32.150" style="s2">guess so I was wondering it you had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.920" end="00:25:32.150" style="s2">come overcome any physiological</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:41.850" style="s2">reticences or just physiological</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.180" end="00:25:45.540" style="s2">barriers to to getting a right</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.850" end="00:25:47.550" style="s2">relationship with your Dame oh yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.540" end="00:25:49.530" style="s2">like Damon&#39;s not asking me to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.550" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">sometimes and I&#39;m gonna remind it of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.530" end="00:25:53.010" style="s2">like those those a Orthodox Christian</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:53.910" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was baptized that they had</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.010" end="00:25:55.920" style="s2">like Desert Fathers</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.910" end="00:25:58.050" style="s2">and how they was like you know went to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.920" end="00:25:59.640" style="s2">the desert and didn&#39;t eat didn&#39;t sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.050" end="00:26:01.560" style="s2">and so they they got closer to God type</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.640" end="00:26:03.240" style="s2">thing and so I was like I made a joke</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.560" end="00:26:05.190" style="s2">like leave I&#39;m a digital desert father</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.240" end="00:26:06.570" style="s2">just sort of like not getting out of my</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.190" end="00:26:08.910" style="s2">head right and just kind of lose just</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.570" end="00:26:10.710" style="s2">following that energy I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.910" end="00:26:14.820" style="s2">dangerous obviously two dollars not too</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.710" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">much but I don&#39;t I answered your</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.820" end="00:26:22.710" style="s2">question that&#39;s what came up part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.230" style="s2">embodiment of this is like you can take</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.710" end="00:26:28.020" style="s2">concepts like I mean even if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.230" end="00:26:30.450" style="s2">unpack game and even unpack that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.020" end="00:26:35.010" style="s2">explain it and some sort of categorical</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.450" end="00:26:37.530" style="s2">way physiological response integrating</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:40.260" style="s2">those concepts that we do actually have</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.530" end="00:26:42.750" style="s2">to confront with and contend with</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.260" end="00:26:45.450" style="s2">because that like prickling sensation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.750" end="00:26:49.260" style="s2">like fever that moves throughout your</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.450" end="00:26:51.120" style="s2">body will stop you you know it&#39;ll close</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.260" end="00:26:53.040" style="s2">your throat up it&#39;ll like prevent you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.120" end="00:26:57.780" style="s2">from emancipating</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.040" end="00:27:01.710" style="s2">you know that energy and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.780" end="00:27:03.480" style="s2">part of the move into bravery is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.710" end="00:27:06.390" style="s2">you just have to do it even though your</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.480" end="00:27:09.450" style="s2">heart is like pumping and you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.390" end="00:27:11.640" style="s2">freaking out you just go for it and try</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.450" end="00:27:14.340" style="s2">and then I think that that maybe is like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.640" end="00:27:17.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t wear the nice edge is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.340" end="00:27:19.680" style="s2">like standing on the precipice of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.190" end="00:27:23.010" style="s2">something and pushing forward without</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.680" end="00:27:26.500" style="s2">falling over into the abyss that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.010" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">cutting through which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.500" end="00:27:31.720" style="s2">I miss Donna&#39;s question and I&#39;d like for</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:35.679" style="s2">her to ask it Donna if you want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.720" end="00:27:37.720" style="s2">your question yeah just very simply I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:41.980" style="s2">kind of new to this group and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.720" end="00:27:44.350" style="s2">interested in your experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.980" end="00:27:55.210" style="s2">knife&#39;s edge in a way that would help</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.350" end="00:27:59.049" style="s2">define it for me yeah the term came from</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.210" end="00:28:01.570" style="s2">I was writing copy for the website and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.049" end="00:28:03.549" style="s2">then Andrew Taggart I meant to reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.570" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">it and he put razor&#39;s edge and I quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.549" end="00:28:10.150" style="s2">like that and then somehow nice edge</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:14.190" style="s2">came up I change it the nice edge and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.150" end="00:28:17.409" style="s2">then I use that as my opening and then I</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.190" end="00:28:18.760" style="s2">got a rap name by Nicolas he called me</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.409" end="00:28:20.919" style="s2">the knife&#39;s edge and I quite liked that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.760" end="00:28:22.570" style="s2">it made sense and I felt into it more</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.919" end="00:28:23.650" style="s2">and I&#39;m like oh ads yeah knife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.570" end="00:28:24.820" style="s2">edge is perfect because I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.650" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">feeling up out of the nice edge right</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.820" end="00:28:27.159" style="s2">now in order to have this right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:30.250" style="s2">relationship with the Dame one it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.159" end="00:28:31.990" style="s2">like you got to be at the nice edge you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.250" end="00:28:34.600" style="s2">got to be virtuous you know you&#39;ve gotta</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.990" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">like challenge of demons you gotta do</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.600" end="00:28:37.179" style="s2">all that type of stuff so it really</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:38.650" style="s2">feels like you&#39;re given a nice edge if</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.179" end="00:28:41.140" style="s2">you if you want to be in right</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.650" end="00:28:42.789" style="s2">relationship with this so I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.140" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">stumbled on the term and then it feels</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.789" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s right for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.010" end="00:28:53.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a few questions here both people</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:58.090" style="s2">having resistance to still the culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.740" end="00:29:01.860" style="s2">and I&#39;m curious to hear it yeah Valerie</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.090" end="00:29:06.630" style="s2">do yourself and ask your question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:09.280" style="s2">so now I feel like I&#39;m being looked at</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.630" end="00:29:13.330" style="s2">okay so as I&#39;m listen to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.280" end="00:29:16.780" style="s2">saying and right that the words sound</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.330" end="00:29:17.230" style="s2">familiar to me but like it feels kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.780" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.230" end="00:29:24.580" style="s2">it just looks familiar you using like</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:26.770" style="s2">different language but the meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.580" end="00:29:29.679" style="s2">familiar to me so I&#39;m particularly</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.770" end="00:29:32.590" style="s2">trying to understand what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.679" end="00:29:35.820" style="s2">still in the culture so what culture why</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.590" end="00:29:35.820" style="s2">still and still and from whom</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.309" end="00:29:40.710" style="s2">I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">first of all I like seeing you as you as</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.710" end="00:29:43.470" style="s2">you know this is good seeing you again</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">my friend</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.470" end="00:29:50.190" style="s2">and yeah I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:53.420" style="s2">reason why you asked that just so I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.190" end="00:29:53.420" style="s2">kind of feel into the question more</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.810" end="00:30:01.080" style="s2">because like I don&#39;t know what does it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.700" end="00:30:04.350" style="s2">mean is it is it implies action like for</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.080" end="00:30:07.740" style="s2">example like maybe it&#39;s a good time to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.350" end="00:30:10.440" style="s2">to start speaking like I like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.740" end="00:30:12.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t like and he mentions like speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.440" end="00:30:15.480" style="s2">up and if you like it like take</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.840" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">responsibility and things happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.480" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">have experience with that so is it the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:31.020" style="s2">same or is it like let&#39;s say referring</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:34.560" style="s2">to the duration of media we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.020" end="00:30:39.830" style="s2">something you hear something real</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.560" end="00:30:45.750" style="s2">authentic okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.830" end="00:30:48.230" style="s2">so sorry I did did you just help yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.750" end="00:30:51.540" style="s2">yeah so what&#39;s coming up for me is um</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.230" end="00:30:53.820" style="s2">yeah that was helpful it&#39;s like one hand</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.540" end="00:30:56.400" style="s2">I say like I&#39;m not too concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.820" end="00:30:58.020" style="s2">the terms I use like like there&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.400" end="00:31:00.480" style="s2">language than Damon then I would use it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.020" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2">but I had a historical relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.480" end="00:31:04.260" style="s2">it the Socrates the book theme you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">a type of stuff so that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.260" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">connected with it but I think what</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:11.610" style="s2">people are hearing it they feel what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:12.810" style="s2">behind it and that&#39;s why I Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.610" end="00:31:15.780" style="s2">Peterson as I mentioned he&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.810" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">therapist for two years and people hate</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.780" end="00:31:20.220" style="s2">him I love him but they felt him right</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.940" end="00:31:22.740" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t this disembodied blue Church</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.220" end="00:31:26.670" style="s2">intellectual yet idiot type type person</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.740" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">he spoke from a source and he spoke from</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.670" end="00:31:32.100" style="s2">that energy or some energy and so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:34.260" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t like don&#39;t focus too much on</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.100" end="00:31:36.540" style="s2">the propositional level I say that focus</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.260" end="00:31:38.490" style="s2">on the energy behind it and what does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.540" end="00:31:41.180" style="s2">say to you or what do you feel like and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.490" end="00:31:44.610" style="s2">maybe what terms work better for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.180" end="00:31:49.030" style="s2">when you feel into that energy so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.610" end="00:31:54.130" style="s2">coming up for me something</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.030" end="00:31:56.530" style="s2">I wanted to say yeah I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.130" end="00:31:57.910" style="s2">his shadow was postmodernism like he</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.530" end="00:31:59.830" style="s2">couldn&#39;t go to the portion Laden realm</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.910" end="00:32:01.180" style="s2">this is why I really like like Raven</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.830" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">because she can get to this abstract</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.180" end="00:32:04.750" style="s2">like Metis space and very few people can</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:06.700" style="s2">like get there and plate with it</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.750" end="00:32:08.080" style="s2">comfortably but I think in this liminal</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.700" end="00:32:09.490" style="s2">war that were entering into where all</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.080" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">these narratives are just flying no one</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.490" end="00:32:12.370" style="s2">knows what&#39;s going on radical</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:14.020" style="s2">uncertainty you had to have that like</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.370" end="00:32:15.820" style="s2">healthy postmodern skill set in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.020" end="00:32:19.090" style="s2">navigate this space and not be so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.820" end="00:32:20.860" style="s2">attached to propositional terms but make</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.090" end="00:32:22.600" style="s2">sure you have the sort of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.860" end="00:32:24.490" style="s2">with the energy behind each proposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.600" end="00:32:25.960" style="s2">like you can sink you can play in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.490" end="00:32:27.040" style="s2">noosphere but you can also sink in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.960" end="00:32:32.620" style="s2">motor sphere and you can go back and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.040" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">forth between the two came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.620" end="00:32:37.390" style="s2">when we were talking about the stealing</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:39.130" style="s2">the culture was maybe a better or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.390" end="00:32:41.920" style="s2">an enlarged ISM that works what well for</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.130" end="00:32:44.950" style="s2">me is actually seduced the culture hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.920" end="00:32:46.840" style="s2">to draw things in like to draw people</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.950" end="00:32:49.180" style="s2">into the light I mean the campfire right</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.840" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">is this kind of beacon if you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.180" end="00:32:56.140" style="s2">dark you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:59.560" style="s2">and you see a glimmer of fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.140" end="00:33:04.120" style="s2">distance that draws you in it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.560" end="00:33:08.170" style="s2">act of seduction and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.120" end="00:33:11.350" style="s2">is not zero-sum like that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.170" end="00:33:13.810" style="s2">that isn&#39;t stealing in the same sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.350" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">it&#39;s stealing in a maybe metaphorical or</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:19.270" style="s2">a loose sense there&#39;s a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:21.820" style="s2">fire is stealing but no human is doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.270" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">the stealing like the fire itself draws</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.820" end="00:33:25.630" style="s2">you in yes no that&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:27.370" style="s2">and it feels almost like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.630" end="00:33:30.310" style="s2">feminine way to put it and the masculine</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.370" end="00:33:33.340" style="s2">way stealing it because I like the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.310" end="00:33:34.840" style="s2">stealing term because John rebecky came</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.340" end="00:33:36.670" style="s2">up with that and a cure the DA is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.840" end="00:33:37.810" style="s2">do a theme song on steal at that clip so</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.670" end="00:33:38.980" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be actual official theme</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.810" end="00:33:41.140" style="s2">song I&#39;m stealing the culture which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.980" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">awesome and I like the idea of stealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.140" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">it because you know a thief does not</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:47.590" style="s2">come announced he just takes and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:50.980" style="s2">takes effectively he doesn&#39;t make a big</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.590" end="00:33:52.420" style="s2">show of it and that&#39;s what I think this</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.980" end="00:33:54.190" style="s2">project should be about like let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.420" end="00:33:55.300" style="s2">broadcast it&#39;s not like oh my God look</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.190" end="00:33:56.560" style="s2">at us we&#39;re awesome right cuz that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.300" end="00:33:58.810" style="s2">just gonna track all the Eagle of noise</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.560" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want it and then once</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.810" end="00:34:02.500" style="s2">things get established and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:04.630" style="s2">dancing around the fire released</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.500" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">rapping we&#39;re getting high on oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.630" end="00:34:08.980" style="s2">then we&#39;re gonna seduce people in to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:13.659" style="s2">become embodied so yeah I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.980" end="00:34:15.700" style="s2">a dual motto of this this space yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.659" end="00:34:18.220" style="s2">I think to like the idea of the thief</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.700" end="00:34:22.050" style="s2">can also be thought of as trickster you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.220" end="00:34:24.669" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of a way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.050" end="00:34:26.679" style="s2">thief or steal maybe appeals to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.669" end="00:34:30.010" style="s2">certain kind of person a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.679" end="00:34:31.690" style="s2">warrior energy somebody who feels like</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.010" end="00:34:38.590" style="s2">against things and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.690" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">subversive and I think maybe seducing or</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.590" end="00:34:43.149" style="s2">I&#39;m drawing in is a little bit or</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:45.159" style="s2">trickster is like trickster is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.149" end="00:34:46.810" style="s2">playing with the magic of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.159" end="00:34:48.669" style="s2">like like creating through this</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.810" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">alchemical process and making mistakes</p>

<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:58.900" style="s2">steal yes that is so so good</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.310" end="00:35:01.480" style="s2">because this is a synchronicity moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.900" end="00:35:03.730" style="s2">so Daniel a defect II was in the room</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.480" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">he mentioned like oh yeah we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.730" end="00:35:06.580" style="s2">about sort of these like maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">primordial language of the Dame on all</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.970" end="00:35:13.710" style="s2">because you gotta find the right</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.930" end="00:35:15.580" style="s2">language to hit and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.710" end="00:35:17.890" style="s2">postmodern language by itself isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.580" end="00:35:19.150" style="s2">neutered it&#39;s a dead end but if you use</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.370" end="00:36:01.060" style="s2">be this a level of which you can laugh</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.800" end="00:36:55.660" style="s2">question sure you folks this is about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.220" end="00:36:58.540" style="s2">nickname by the way you should see him</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.660" end="00:37:02.080" style="s2">every Saturday at this freestyle depict</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.540" end="00:37:03.670" style="s2">in so Peter my question to you and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.080" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">you to Raven if you have any insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.670" end="00:37:08.790" style="s2">into this how does one mitigate demonic</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">false positives so an example could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.790" end="00:37:14.200" style="s2">your ego is taking over and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:15.850" style="s2">masquerading as intuitive wisdom there</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.200" end="00:37:17.950" style="s2">was a suggestion earlier that communitas</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.850" end="00:37:20.200" style="s2">could act as a regulatory force here</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.950" end="00:37:21.430" style="s2">then the question kind of goes is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.200" end="00:37:25.780" style="s2">another level how do you regulate</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.430" end="00:37:27.580" style="s2">communitas yeah so we were texting about</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.780" end="00:37:31.360" style="s2">this Daniel I need propositional</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.580" end="00:37:34.360" style="s2">violence I need people to disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.360" end="00:37:36.130" style="s2">me aggressively and I think people need</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.360" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">to be disagreed with aggressively but</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.130" end="00:37:41.320" style="s2">sort of in like a safe on safe space in</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:43.360" style="s2">order to keep each other in check so</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.320" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">we&#39;re not get too eagerly attached to</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.360" end="00:37:48.100" style="s2">propositions an interpretation of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:50.230" style="s2">the energy is going interview happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.100" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">so that that&#39;s my take and I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.230" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">what Raven has to think about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex question I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:38:01.240" style="s2">once you get above the level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:03.150" style="s2">community oz you know you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.240" end="00:38:05.860" style="s2">want to be meaning on the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.150" end="00:38:08.860" style="s2">into like individual actors embodying</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.860" end="00:38:10.660" style="s2">that those qualities to try and enforce</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.860" end="00:38:13.270" style="s2">it top down I think would be a way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.660" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">trying to take some abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:18.010" style="s2">regulate the behavior but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:20.080" style="s2">kind of move from a bottom up position</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.010" end="00:38:22.770" style="s2">in order to create this emergent</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.080" end="00:38:25.210" style="s2">property of checks and balances</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.770" end="00:38:26.619" style="s2">Alexandra bardos actually talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.210" end="00:38:29.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.619" end="00:38:30.730" style="s2">things coming in threes there being</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.079" end="00:38:32.859" style="s2">these kinds of like structures or</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.730" end="00:38:36.190" style="s2">movement between different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.859" end="00:38:38.049" style="s2">things that allow for things anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.190" end="00:38:40.480" style="s2">proposition to be seen as incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.049" end="00:38:45.400" style="s2">without being challenged by these two</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.480" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">other sides of things and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.400" end="00:38:49.569" style="s2">there are ways that maybe intuitively as</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:52.420" style="s2">we move through this like new really</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.569" end="00:38:56.529" style="s2">like uncertain place we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.420" end="00:38:59.079" style="s2">creating and experimenting I think as</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.529" end="00:39:02.559" style="s2">individuals being really sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.079" end="00:39:03.970" style="s2">feedback and also allowing for people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.559" end="00:39:06.670" style="s2">express authentically when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.970" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">experiencing shadow emotions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.670" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">really important to be able to say like</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:12.999" style="s2">yeah you know I&#39;m when you do that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:16.150" style="s2">feel jealous of you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.999" end="00:39:19.390" style="s2">or when when you do that I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.150" end="00:39:21.999" style="s2">want to grab you or whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.390" end="00:39:23.859" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing allows for that to</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.999" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">come forth and be shared in the space in</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.859" end="00:39:28.960" style="s2">between people and you can reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">shadow it&#39;s like you take the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.960" end="00:39:34.180" style="s2">normally we would feel ashamed to to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">and we allow for that to be a subject of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.180" end="00:39:40.930" style="s2">the dialogue of the community Oz and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:43.989" style="s2">think if we practice those things and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.930" end="00:39:45.700" style="s2">move you know in a small scale and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.989" end="00:39:46.839" style="s2">think the splitting off two is effective</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.700" end="00:39:48.999" style="s2">because if you try and grow the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.839" end="00:39:51.910" style="s2">group larger and larger you&#39;ll start to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.999" end="00:39:54.670" style="s2">face different challenges as the group</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.910" end="00:39:57.039" style="s2">size scales up but if you just break off</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.670" end="00:39:58.660" style="s2">into little pieces you have a group of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.039" end="00:40:01.210" style="s2">five and then it grows to 10 and then it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.660" end="00:40:04.359" style="s2">splits into two fives then you&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.210" end="00:40:10.839" style="s2">of able to maintain the platoon scale</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.359" end="00:40:12.309" style="s2">kind of like mobile dynamic wave and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.839" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">need that because the climate is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.309" end="00:40:16.660" style="s2">uncertain we&#39;re not really ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:24.190" style="s2">building institutions yet but rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.660" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">just maintaining these platoons I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.190" end="00:40:28.749" style="s2">Rachel had a really good question in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:31.989" style="s2">here that I was I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.749" end="00:40:35.309" style="s2">Rachel would you like to share yes so</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.989" end="00:40:38.589" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about masculine stealing</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.309" end="00:40:40.330" style="s2">feminine seducing if they mean the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.589" end="00:40:43.150" style="s2">things in different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.330" end="00:40:45.880" style="s2">some if one is public and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.150" end="00:40:48.610" style="s2">private when we&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.880" end="00:40:51.340" style="s2">keeping things close they&#39;re not letting</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.610" end="00:40:54.970" style="s2">everybody know is there maybe like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.340" end="00:40:59.400" style="s2">masculine private and a feminine public</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.970" end="00:41:03.340" style="s2">going on here hmm that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.400" end="00:41:05.410" style="s2">what do you think Rachel um I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.340" end="00:41:07.240" style="s2">there might be higher and in other</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.410" end="00:41:13.150" style="s2">places and I&#39;m starting to think that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.240" end="00:41:15.160" style="s2">could be an adaptive behavior where like</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.150" end="00:41:17.650" style="s2">less fierce like Strauss talk about</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.160" end="00:41:21.750" style="s2">keeping things secretive and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.650" end="00:41:25.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a feminine energy that helps</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.750" end="00:41:29.550" style="s2">conceal things in a softer way uh is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.180" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">needed or a public interfacing right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.550" end="00:41:46.600" style="s2">yeah that feels really really right I</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:48.850" style="s2">want to get to thank you Rachel I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.600" end="00:41:49.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.850" end="00:41:53.430" style="s2">thinking about and I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.870" end="00:41:58.660" style="s2">about it a lot the role of feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.430" end="00:42:02.230" style="s2">unknown space to traverse in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.660" end="00:42:05.110" style="s2">the feminine being realized this is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.230" end="00:42:07.570" style="s2">entirely new territory there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.110" end="00:42:10.840" style="s2">kind of I mean I guess it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.570" end="00:42:12.250" style="s2">what like like vein of feminism any you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.840" end="00:42:14.050" style="s2">know anybody&#39;s adopted but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.250" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve like created structures around</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.050" end="00:42:18.910" style="s2">like the role of the feminine in society</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:22.450" style="s2">that seem to be failing not only women</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.910" end="00:42:26.410" style="s2">but everyone and moving forward into a</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.450" end="00:42:28.540" style="s2">place of greater like maturation of of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.410" end="00:42:32.100" style="s2">the feminine seems like it&#39;s just never</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.540" end="00:42:32.100" style="s2">been done before in human history</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.220" end="00:42:37.690" style="s2">seems like a seems like a brand-new</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:39.400" style="s2">thing which means there&#39;s no role models</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.690" end="00:42:44.250" style="s2">I mean I think that that&#39;s the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.400" end="00:42:47.950" style="s2">here with with moving into like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.250" end="00:42:52.600" style="s2">female like maturity is like well who do</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.950" end="00:42:54.190" style="s2">you who are your elders who embodies</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.600" end="00:42:56.950" style="s2">this because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.190" end="00:42:59.109" style="s2">the the power of like coming into</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.950" end="00:43:00.789" style="s2">oneself with technology like with</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.109" end="00:43:03.430" style="s2">digital technology and with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.789" end="00:43:06.160" style="s2">coming with more immersive technologies</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.430" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">into the future is just such a different</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:10.900" style="s2">way of expressing and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:14.160" style="s2">and I think is it&#39;s polluted and is</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.900" end="00:43:17.289" style="s2">spatial and is rooted in images and like</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.160" end="00:43:21.130" style="s2">communication that is indirect which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.289" end="00:43:23.770" style="s2">the communication of the feminine and to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.130" end="00:43:25.150" style="s2">be moving into that and being in right</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.770" end="00:43:27.309" style="s2">relationship with it when there are all</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.150" end="00:43:30.599" style="s2">these other kinds of dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.309" end="00:43:34.750" style="s2">commodification of sexual ization of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.599" end="00:43:37.900" style="s2">like self annihilation that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.750" end="00:43:42.490" style="s2">being in social media there&#39;s so many so</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.900" end="00:43:46.270" style="s2">many shadows to be moving out as as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.490" end="00:43:48.069" style="s2">feminine entity into the world so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.270" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">those things have been on my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.069" end="00:43:53.140" style="s2">long I just wanna say really cool to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:54.849" style="s2">have like Raven Rachael Ray Donna and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.140" end="00:43:56.680" style="s2">all the kind of the feminine energy in</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.849" end="00:43:58.329" style="s2">this place cuz I don&#39;t know what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.680" end="00:44:00.250" style="s2">going on there you know like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.329" end="00:44:01.270" style="s2">my language I&#39;m tapped into but I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.250" end="00:44:16.510" style="s2">really want to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.270" end="00:44:18.730" style="s2">with it so for me personally a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:22.059" style="s2">times when I try to tap into my mom when</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.730" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">I&#39;m in different conversations I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.059" end="00:44:28.059" style="s2">very like I&#39;m very into like edgy memes</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">and so I sometimes like this one</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.059" end="00:44:32.980" style="s2">only say the worst thing yeah like good</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:34.750" style="s2">at the time and this kind of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.980" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">of so I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.750" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">experienced this sometimes the daemon</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:42.760" style="s2">can be very sort of like banned allistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:44.170" style="s2">and it&#39;s in this direction and if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.760" end="00:44:46.869" style="s2">experience that like what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.170" end="00:44:49.349" style="s2">about that and how do you deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.869" end="00:44:52.029" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.349" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">yeah like daniel said like the daemon is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.029" end="00:44:57.730" style="s2">a troll and all that yeah like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:59.049" style="s2">like a desire to give advice and I also</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.730" end="00:45:00.910" style="s2">kind of know you too like Jordans in</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.049" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">Toronto like I&#39;ve seen some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.910" end="00:45:03.940" style="s2">things he wears that has that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.230" end="00:45:07.390" style="s2">like trollish flair to it which I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.940" end="00:45:09.279" style="s2">name but maybe maybe Daniel my sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.390" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">they not as a good good response to</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.279" end="00:45:11.970" style="s2">Jordans</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.039" end="00:45:19.219" style="s2">on the spot here you said the daemon as</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.630" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">a troll in the chatbox maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.219" end="00:45:26.329" style="s2">elaborate on that I think sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:29.900" style="s2">it&#39;s the right thing like I I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.329" end="00:45:32.239" style="s2">I read Socrates as a troll and he&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.900" end="00:45:36.679" style="s2">of going around poking and prodding</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.239" end="00:45:38.539" style="s2">people and getting them to wake up the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.679" end="00:45:40.099" style="s2">question is like what&#39;s your false</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.539" end="00:45:41.209" style="s2">positive or false negative right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.099" end="00:45:43.609" style="s2">always gonna come down to that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.209" end="00:45:47.539" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;re you&#39;re like a bad troll</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.609" end="00:45:49.339" style="s2">and sometimes your control and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.539" end="00:45:52.039" style="s2">the daemon also gets trained over time</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.339" end="00:45:53.390" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s all about you can develop a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.039" end="00:45:55.189" style="s2">relationship with your daemon but the de</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.390" end="00:45:57.079" style="s2">menthe itself is not actually aiming in</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.189" end="00:45:58.489" style="s2">the right direction but throughout your</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.079" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">life it gets better and better at aiming</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.489" end="00:46:03.199" style="s2">in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:04.609" style="s2">yeah and I also add it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.199" end="00:46:06.439" style="s2">you&#39;d that trollish tendency could have</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.609" end="00:46:08.630" style="s2">a demonic quality to it but who the</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.439" end="00:46:10.489" style="s2">egoic so like look at me look at me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.630" end="00:46:12.829" style="s2">not these like you know there&#39;s social</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.489" end="00:46:14.359" style="s2">justice people or whatever that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.829" end="00:46:16.429" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on so there could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.359" end="00:46:24.709" style="s2">the attention-seeking things there I</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.429" end="00:46:30.559" style="s2">imagine I&#39;m curious with ajaces chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.709" end="00:46:32.119" style="s2">good versus chaotic evil kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.559" end="00:46:35.299" style="s2">twitter meme that&#39;s been happening</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.119" end="00:46:38.599" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to mind and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.299" end="00:46:41.679" style="s2">connects to the trickster energy just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.599" end="00:46:45.019" style="s2">desire to shake things up and for me</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.679" end="00:46:47.989" style="s2">it&#39;s always connected to wanting people</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.019" end="00:46:49.939" style="s2">to see outside of their their culture or</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.989" end="00:46:53.150" style="s2">their conditioning and that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.939" end="00:46:55.969" style="s2">trickster the chaotic good or evil or</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.150" end="00:46:58.489" style="s2">the troll even it&#39;s like this longing</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.969" end="00:47:01.939" style="s2">for people to just break out of their</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.489" end="00:47:03.589" style="s2">boxes and see the world in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.939" end="00:47:05.569" style="s2">new way that&#39;s what&#39;s coming up for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.589" end="00:47:07.699" style="s2">and a gem and the spire to ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.569" end="00:47:09.289" style="s2">question because you&#39;re ashamed you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.699" end="00:47:10.369" style="s2">cater here in Toronto and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.289" end="00:47:13.519" style="s2">kicking ass in the stove and all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.369" end="00:47:15.559" style="s2">like cool events the stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.519" end="00:47:17.900" style="s2">heard today having spoken about the Dame</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.559" end="00:47:19.669" style="s2">on and relation with ego and stuff how</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.900" end="00:47:22.479" style="s2">do you think that what is your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.669" end="00:47:22.479" style="s2">how that relates a shame</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.750" end="00:47:29.710" style="s2">I kind of interpret you Peter as having</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.530" end="00:47:31.360" style="s2">a had a shame breakthrough where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.710" end="00:47:34.090" style="s2">know what happened in your life but</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.360" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">there was a moment where you</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.090" end="00:47:38.920" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be bothered to care what people</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:42.550" style="s2">thought as much anymore and it freed you</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.920" end="00:47:43.930" style="s2">to just follow some kind of passion but</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.550" end="00:47:45.400" style="s2">said do this and you&#39;re like okay I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.930" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">do it then you called that your daemon</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:50.410" style="s2">and that&#39;s how I interpret it that I had</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.360" style="s2">a shame breakthrough moment as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.410" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">there are these moments where for</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.360" end="00:47:57.640" style="s2">whatever reason we just can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:59.620" style="s2">bothered to care enough about all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.640" end="00:48:02.620" style="s2">other people&#39;s opinions and expectations</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.620" end="00:48:05.500" style="s2">and then we kind of feel free to just be</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.620" end="00:48:07.720" style="s2">ourselves and like I look at shame as</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.500" end="00:48:09.220" style="s2">the mitigating wall between the real me</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.720" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">and the outside world and shame says</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.220" end="00:48:14.200" style="s2">don&#39;t show them that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:15.340" style="s2">show them this or this and when you have</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.200" end="00:48:17.890" style="s2">that breakthrough you just have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.340" end="00:48:20.110" style="s2">channel where you can kind of be you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.890" end="00:48:22.270" style="s2">know more direct and sometimes it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.110" end="00:48:25.120" style="s2">like as Jordan was saying it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.270" end="00:48:29.110" style="s2">either glia stuff that I&#39;m not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.120" end="00:48:32.500" style="s2">to say yeah sometimes it&#39;s just the real</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.110" end="00:48:34.930" style="s2">like real emotional authentic truths</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.500" end="00:48:37.060" style="s2">that you just always hide that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.930" end="00:48:38.560" style="s2">and when I was hearing talk I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.060" end="00:48:39.820" style="s2">hearing the daemon talk right there cuz</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.560" end="00:48:42.850" style="s2">that was delicious you know I just like</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.820" end="00:48:44.800" style="s2">my body was filled with like foo mos and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.850" end="00:48:47.650" style="s2">then I want double-click on something</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.800" end="00:48:49.690" style="s2">you said a shame breakthrough that could</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.650" end="00:48:51.190" style="s2">be a really good workshop if we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.690" end="00:48:53.350" style="s2">of like figure out how to do that shame</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.190" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">breakthrough and I think if I knew how</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.350" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">to bottle that what&#39;s the matter is</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.610" end="00:49:04.540" style="s2">entirely my goal is how do you help</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.410" end="00:49:07.990" style="s2">people have a breakthrough moment where</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.540" end="00:49:11.470" style="s2">they have the freedom to be themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.990" end="00:49:12.790" style="s2">Oh AJ like because agent I were going</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.470" end="00:49:14.560" style="s2">back and forth about trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.790" end="00:49:16.180" style="s2">out a weekly session that maybe could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.560" end="00:49:19.560" style="s2">it Shane breakthrough or you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.180" end="00:49:22.450" style="s2">radically experiment on how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.560" end="00:49:24.550" style="s2">yeah I love that I mean that&#39;s my life</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.450" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">is trying to figure out how most</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.550" end="00:49:29.320" style="s2">directly to explain to someone what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:30.700" style="s2">experienced and to find out do they need</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.320" end="00:49:32.020" style="s2">to experience that could they experience</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.700" end="00:49:33.880" style="s2">that is there an opportunity there have</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.020" end="00:49:35.470" style="s2">they already experienced it what other</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.880" end="00:49:36.580" style="s2">ways could you have a breakthrough</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.470" end="00:49:39.160" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.580" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">my whole dream so I love that idea let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.160" end="00:49:42.910" style="s2">do that and see what happens here there</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:45.460" style="s2">were just AJ and I that was like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.910" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">Damon speaking to itself through to</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.460" end="00:49:48.970" style="s2">people in a way and I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:50.350" style="s2">these conversations with everyone really</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.970" end="00:49:52.930" style="s2">who&#39;s coming in as a distill atutor to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.350" end="00:49:54.280" style="s2">the stoah so I think it&#39;s like an art</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.930" end="00:49:55.900" style="s2">form in a way if you can speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.280" end="00:49:57.730" style="s2">this language you can speak it with</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.900" end="00:50:04.540" style="s2">other people and you can unlock it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.730" end="00:50:06.430" style="s2">then you can emancipate it it might be</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.540" end="00:50:07.840" style="s2">like creative force right like when two</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.430" end="00:50:09.130" style="s2">minds come together and run a few Minds</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.840" end="00:50:11.080" style="s2">come together and you&#39;re just like in</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.130" end="00:50:13.960" style="s2">sync and in flow and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.080" end="00:50:16.870" style="s2">really creating new Sparks and new</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.960" end="00:50:20.580" style="s2">possible places like that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.870" end="00:50:24.130" style="s2">another way to explain the Damon and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.580" end="00:50:24.790" style="s2">speaking of changing things and shaking</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.130" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">things up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.790" end="00:50:35.770" style="s2">Isaiah&#39;s do you want to bring forth your</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:38.050" style="s2">question yeah so in reading your your</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.770" end="00:50:39.910" style="s2">journal entries Peter I keep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.050" end="00:50:44.890" style="s2">about the article you wrote culture war</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.910" end="00:50:48.610" style="s2">2.0 pointing to a lot of of the Occupy</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.890" end="00:50:49.000" style="s2">movement that&#39;s like one of the I guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.610" end="00:50:51.820" style="s2">the UH</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.000" end="00:50:54.340" style="s2">like it just like it set off a like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.820" end="00:50:55.630" style="s2">depolarization in the culture and I like</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.340" end="00:50:57.250" style="s2">thinking a lot about movies in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.630" end="00:50:58.870" style="s2">matrix in this whole like DejaVu</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.250" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">switching the matrix thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.870" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">currently we&#39;re big businesses are being</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:06.550" style="s2">bailed out and it&#39;s literally impossible</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.310" style="s2">to form that kind of movement right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.550" end="00:51:12.310" style="s2">so I&#39;m wondering if you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.310" end="00:51:16.180" style="s2">emancipation of the damemon can can help</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.310" end="00:51:19.060" style="s2">us like be engineer such movement and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.180" end="00:51:21.730" style="s2">maybe even to like and the law I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.060" end="00:51:24.360" style="s2">don&#39;t want to because I constantly keep</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.730" end="00:51:27.540" style="s2">thinking now this lockdown will only end</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.360" end="00:51:32.610" style="s2">through some sort of like mass active</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.540" end="00:51:35.530" style="s2">social of civil disobedience like if if</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.610" end="00:51:36.940" style="s2">if the people in charge like they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.530" end="00:51:38.500" style="s2">if they don&#39;t listen to the demon or if</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.940" end="00:51:40.330" style="s2">they don&#39;t have these types of things</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.500" end="00:51:42.309" style="s2">like why would they give up this power</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.330" end="00:51:44.529" style="s2">they currently have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.309" end="00:51:46.900" style="s2">and what comes to mind is conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.529" end="00:51:47.979" style="s2">have with Jordan Hall recently sojourn</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.900" end="00:51:50.140" style="s2">was a friend of mine he&#39;s been mentoring</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.979" end="00:51:52.479" style="s2">me for a while and I just said to him</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.140" end="00:51:54.670" style="s2">like you know what I don&#39;t feel your</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.479" end="00:51:57.430" style="s2">heart you know like he talks in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.670" end="00:51:58.989" style="s2">abstraction and it feels like almost a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.430" end="00:52:00.819" style="s2">propositional prison he&#39;s putting on to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.989" end="00:52:03.430" style="s2">me because he&#39;s a highly smart he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.819" end="00:52:06.939" style="s2">probably like the Olympic level athlete</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.430" end="00:52:08.259" style="s2">in in the noosphere but doesn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.939" end="00:52:09.910" style="s2">with his heart and he agreed with me</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.259" end="00:52:11.439" style="s2">says yeah I get that advice a lot and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.910" end="00:52:13.059" style="s2">find I had rizona out when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.439" end="00:52:16.239" style="s2">sometimes and I&#39;m like ten metaphors to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.059" end="00:52:17.189" style="s2">understand as metaphor I think him and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.239" end="00:52:19.809" style="s2">are getting in right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.189" end="00:52:22.359" style="s2">speaking of the heart together but why</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.809" end="00:52:24.339" style="s2">he came to mind is that I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.359" end="00:52:24.969" style="s2">need an answer in the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.339" end="00:52:26.499" style="s2">realm</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.969" end="00:52:29.019" style="s2">I think we still have to stay in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.499" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">state of unknowingness and my sense we</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.019" end="00:52:43.650" style="s2">just take it one step at a time and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:43.650" style="s2">anything will emerge one more question</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.380" end="00:52:55.390" style="s2">okay some really good ideas in here for</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.019" end="00:52:58.959" style="s2">how to emancipate your daemon improv</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.390" end="00:52:59.859" style="s2">sessions this is what like I gazing so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.959" end="00:53:02.759" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.859" end="00:53:04.869" style="s2">this is exactly what I wanted right like</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.759" end="00:53:06.670" style="s2">this type of idea is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.869" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">flooding in this is the day one speaking</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.670" end="00:53:13.359" style="s2">right now okay I guess I guess so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:16.239" style="s2">something I&#39;ll say that maybe it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.359" end="00:53:18.749" style="s2">to time to go but I have another event</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.239" end="00:53:21.519" style="s2">coming up called building the stoah</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.749" end="00:53:22.599" style="s2">that&#39;s on the weekend Sunday I need help</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.519" end="00:53:26.559" style="s2">here right it&#39;s like a one-man operation</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.599" end="00:53:27.759" style="s2">right now and I&#39;m burning out and if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.559" end="00:53:28.989" style="s2">don&#39;t let me go insane then maybe you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.759" end="00:53:31.569" style="s2">be good to you don&#39;t lend a hand with</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.989" end="00:53:33.579" style="s2">something and so if you&#39;re inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.569" end="00:53:35.079" style="s2">do that just go to build into stoah on</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.579" end="00:53:36.729" style="s2">weekend and we kind of discussed</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.079" end="00:53:38.170" style="s2">practical things there&#39;s all these like</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.729" end="00:53:39.939" style="s2">practical ideas like someone said oh I</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.170" end="00:53:41.529" style="s2">want to continue this discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.939" end="00:53:42.699" style="s2">let&#39;s have like an after party zoom link</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.529" end="00:53:44.170" style="s2">in the chat because that can&#39;t be here</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.699" end="00:53:46.089" style="s2">so that hasn&#39;t after that&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.170" end="00:53:47.229" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to amend that and maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.089" end="00:53:48.729" style="s2">don&#39;t need to maybe that could be</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.229" end="00:53:49.599" style="s2">outsourced to some kind of like culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.729" end="00:53:52.479" style="s2">that forms out of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.599" end="00:53:53.799" style="s2">so I like this idea is like maybe these</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.479" end="00:53:55.239" style="s2">two sessions relate to each other that</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.799" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">one&#39;s is practical like the nuts and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.239" end="00:53:57.490" style="s2">bolts of it like</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.230" end="00:53:59.109" style="s2">how to do better than that management</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.490" end="00:54:01.660" style="s2">how to do better like advertisement and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.109" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">stuff like that and then this one is</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.660" end="00:54:08.349" style="s2">sort of like sourcing the idea like</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:09.990" style="s2">emancipating it slowly and I will say -</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.349" end="00:54:13.630" style="s2">like I&#39;m not gonna post this one</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.990" end="00:54:15.609" style="s2">broadcast it I will maybe make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.630" end="00:54:17.290" style="s2">unlisted and send everyone a link to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.609" end="00:54:19.119" style="s2">and then I&#39;ll let you use your</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.290" end="00:54:26.680" style="s2">discernment on who you send it to and</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.119" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">try not to send it on the ego because a</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.680" end="00:54:30.900" style="s2">good thief doesn&#39;t come announced Oh</p>
