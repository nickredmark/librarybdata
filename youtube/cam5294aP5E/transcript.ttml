<p begin="00:00:02.649" end="00:00:07.240" style="s2">this is the important thing the human</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.270" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">beings are obligate tribal okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.240" end="00:00:13.780" style="s2">are we are part of something yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:16.480" style="s2">for if we&#39;re not part of something we</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.780" end="00:00:18.580" style="s2">are drift yes and what&#39;s happening is is</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.480" end="00:00:20.860" style="s2">that as we as you as you exit is you</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.580" end="00:00:23.470" style="s2">take the red plate as you exit the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.860" end="00:00:26.470" style="s2">tradition that is not working you you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.470" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">now are addressed and and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.470" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">to which you&#39;re able to find something</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:33.699" style="s2">that you can be part of that is itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:35.230" style="s2">has the at least the ingredients to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.699" end="00:00:36.730" style="s2">adapted it may actually not initially be</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.230" end="00:00:39.129" style="s2">adapted but it has the ingredients the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.730" end="00:00:40.149" style="s2">capacity has the scope and competence to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.129" end="00:00:41.710" style="s2">actually be able to start making</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.149" end="00:00:43.300" style="s2">effective choices in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.710" end="00:00:45.389" style="s2">what&#39;s happening you will naturally</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.300" end="00:00:49.659" style="s2">begin to up gradient in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.389" end="00:00:51.909" style="s2">so okay how&#39;s that show up mmm I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.659" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">like all right right sure to check it</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.909" end="00:00:57.909" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:01:00.039" style="s2">where was this something happens</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.909" end="00:01:02.260" style="s2">somewhere where there was a crisis there</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.039" end="00:01:05.259" style="s2">was a town and in the town you had a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.260" end="00:01:09.579" style="s2">political structure and oh it was during</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.259" end="00:01:10.990" style="s2">Katrina so Mississippi Katrina right the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.579" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">you know hurricane his the leaders are</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.990" end="00:01:15.579" style="s2">breaking and the existing political</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">structure just drops them all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.579" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">right what happens is this one guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:24.460" style="s2">like the guy who runs the general store</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:26.259" style="s2">has his shit together and he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.460" end="00:01:28.119" style="s2">coordinate coordinate effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.259" end="00:01:30.579" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about local small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.119" end="00:01:33.880" style="s2">effective choices but that creates an</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.579" end="00:01:35.259" style="s2">attractor and other people who swiftness</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.880" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">that attractor they&#39;re like looking and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.259" end="00:01:39.579" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing chaos in all directions</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:42.939" style="s2">and they see one spot over there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.579" end="00:01:44.649" style="s2">not chaos in all directions and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.939" end="00:01:46.719" style="s2">begin to orient themselves towards that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.649" end="00:01:48.609" style="s2">and so he says okay well you do this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.719" end="00:01:50.259" style="s2">they start doing that and as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.609" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">out that doesn&#39;t fuck that doesn&#39;t suck</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.259" end="00:01:54.939" style="s2">it works a little bit and and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:59.140" style="s2">been working with him it works better so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.939" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">then the zone of coordinated action the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.140" end="00:02:05.140" style="s2">zone of order the zone of non chaos</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:07.749" style="s2">begins to grow organically because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.140" end="00:02:09.670" style="s2">were that obligate tribalism is that if</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.749" end="00:02:12.970" style="s2">we don&#39;t as individuals lunar lose our</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.670" end="00:02:13.480" style="s2">capacity as individuals to see and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.970" end="00:02:15.640" style="s2">orient</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.480" end="00:02:17.799" style="s2">towards what is truly effective choice</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.640" end="00:02:19.299" style="s2">in our context as long as we have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.799" end="00:02:21.670" style="s2">capacity which is our natural human</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.299" end="00:02:23.980" style="s2">mobility and then we have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.670" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">to orient ourselves to it in a flexible</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.980" end="00:02:27.700" style="s2">way so that we can upgrade e&#39;en its</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:29.170" style="s2">capacity then you get a positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.700" end="00:02:30.730" style="s2">feedback loop in the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.170" end="00:02:34.120" style="s2">you that you&#39;re in my source is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.730" end="00:02:35.890" style="s2">liminal shamanic um you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.120" end="00:02:38.620" style="s2">dealing with chaos all the time really</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.890" end="00:02:41.290" style="s2">and so let&#39;s actually use that skill set</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.620" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">to Rico here something that is leaps all</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.290" end="00:02:44.799" style="s2">over it you know crosses the chasm you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">know does the valley crossing into</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.799" end="00:02:50.680" style="s2">something that works right yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">feels like this is a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.680" end="00:02:54.040" style="s2">prophecy I mean I think what we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:56.890" style="s2">to witness is that I think we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.040" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">to witness in the West is a generalised</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.890" end="00:03:01.750" style="s2">failure of traditions institutional</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.269" style="s2">structures leadership as it currently</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.750" end="00:03:05.650" style="s2">exists for reasons both of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.269" end="00:03:09.250" style="s2">and ontological epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.650" end="00:03:12.129" style="s2">inadequacy right and the movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.250" end="00:03:13.150" style="s2">towards the collective intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.129" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">move it towards distributed intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.150" end="00:03:17.079" style="s2">cognition binding those individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:18.639" style="s2">groups that are actually able to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.079" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">increasingly effective choices in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.639" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">context what&#39;s really happening and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:24.880" style="s2">learning how to Rico here and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:26.109" style="s2">coordinate with those groups so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.880" end="00:03:29.859" style="s2">they were able to scale and increase</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.109" end="00:03:32.470" style="s2">their effectiveness I would say is if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.859" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">not this time and I think this time is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.470" end="00:03:35.769" style="s2">good opportunity like it&#39;s a good trial</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.780" style="s2">run and it may be the one where that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.769" end="00:03:40.299" style="s2">happens if not this time it will be sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.780" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">of in the next few times of this you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.299" end="00:03:44.340" style="s2">know this increase in Delta II mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.819" end="00:03:50.650" style="s2">it was a human know of course our good</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.319" end="00:03:51.910" style="s2">but there is a problem I see in that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.650" end="00:03:54.940" style="s2">mean that your prophecy I think your</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.910" end="00:03:56.620" style="s2">prophecy is accurate what I meant is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.940" end="00:03:58.840" style="s2">thinking again of other example the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.620" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">Weimar Republic uh-huh it you get an in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:03.010" style="s2">it you get a group of individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:04.599" style="s2">are locally very effective but it turns</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:06.910" style="s2">out that the global solution that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.599" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">they&#39;re proposing is actually while it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.910" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">ends up destroying Germany right it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">actually turns out to be massively</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">yeah the the so you clearly have</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:20.850" style="s2">individuals that are on the street right</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.940" style="s2">and in in you know in the marketplace of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.850" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">Germany like they&#39;re there they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.940" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">creating that attractor of order that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">well that&#39;s why they succeed right there</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:32.250" style="s2">but what they do is that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">configuration the dynamical system they</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.250" end="00:04:35.460" style="s2">engendered I mean this is kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">know a version of the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.460" end="00:04:40.860" style="s2">Commons right it&#39;s locally order</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:43.170" style="s2">generating but what it it&#39;s it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.860" end="00:04:45.540" style="s2">service again of this growth of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.170" end="00:04:47.940" style="s2">psychotic conspiracy theory that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.540" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">ultimately puts the whole you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.940" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">whole country on a path of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.070" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">self-destruction yeah I think well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.830" end="00:04:59.460" style="s2">think what we&#39;re gonna see is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:05:03.180" style="s2">gonna see something like a million Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.460" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">parties oh right I think I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.180" end="00:05:11.400" style="s2">gonna see is just lots and lots and lots</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">of micro psychotic cabal&#39;s yes and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.400" end="00:05:16.919" style="s2">question is going to be how do they</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">relate to each other because and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.919" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2">level of systemic breakdown is is you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">know the the the default state is</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:27.270" style="s2">failure yeah so it&#39;s not like we needed</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:28.830" style="s2">Nazis to fail it&#39;s more like we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.270" end="00:05:30.780" style="s2">something we need to do the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.830" end="00:05:34.169" style="s2">Nazis to succeed and the default state</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.780" end="00:05:38.430" style="s2">is failure right so what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.169" end="00:05:41.790" style="s2">like well it looks a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.430" end="00:05:44.940" style="s2">what Peter a cultural or two dot oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.790" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">yeah but but x yeah multiplied by a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.940" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">factor probably five orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:53.640" style="s2">oh yeah so my concern there is then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:55.070" style="s2">you get you get general systems collapse</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.640" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">because if you get this proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.070" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">look at all the your internal social</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:02.820" style="s2">environment becomes as complex and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:04.260" style="s2">unmanned it as unmanageable as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.820" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">external environment you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.260" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">respond to wow you know it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:15.390" style="s2">in this case like something like a virus</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:18.419" style="s2">and here specifically nature may be our</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.390" end="00:06:21.270" style="s2">saving grace hmm because if the if the</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">no politics finance it&#39;s like sociology</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.930" end="00:06:40.470" style="s2">things like identity and the medics</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.880" end="00:06:40.970" style="s2">torture those are so easily how do I say</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.080" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">environment I think I can kind of go</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.099" end="00:07:03.030" style="s2">is that it&#39;s funny I think it just</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.400" end="00:07:05.099" style="s2">happened actually in Iran a cleric you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.030" end="00:07:06.870" style="s2">went to go admitted minister some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.099" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">who have got the virus and he didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:14.160" style="s2">model was that he would be protected and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.400" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">he got sick and died this isn&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.160" end="00:07:17.820" style="s2">what your psychotic story is like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">is that&#39;s rock-bottom this that I kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.820" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">of break it hits rock bottom and so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:26.819" style="s2">know not being sick we&#39;re not dying from</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">sickness is like the kind that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.819" end="00:07:30.780" style="s2">that that&#39;s it wow I forgotten about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:33.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s acute to check some of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.780" end="00:07:35.099" style="s2">whole story is is nature now at the end</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.720" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">of the day we&#39;re all running psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.099" end="00:07:39.240" style="s2">narratives the questions are they</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:42.060" style="s2">adaptive psychotic narratives or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">right right so the more the crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.060" end="00:07:47.340" style="s2">that we run into our non sociological</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:50.729" style="s2">crises that are affect national actual</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.340" end="00:07:53.070" style="s2">natural crises that are visceral so you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.729" end="00:07:55.800" style="s2">know climate change unfortunately until</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.070" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">it is so intense that it&#39;s irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.800" end="00:08:00.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not visceral you kind of everything</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:04.169" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing is mediated by a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.539" end="00:08:07.530" style="s2">large interpretive distance and so you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.169" end="00:08:12.810" style="s2">can always run a narrative in between</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.530" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">those two points yes and avoid avoid we</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.810" end="00:08:16.169" style="s2">call it rock bottom yeah in to hit you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:17.909" style="s2">in the face with something that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.169" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">can&#39;t avoid no matter what there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.909" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">something like getting sick and dying</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">from a virus that&#39;s growing very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:26.280" style="s2">you know if you take a look at it every</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:29.039" style="s2">one of these micro cabal&#39;s of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.280" end="00:08:30.419" style="s2">psychotics they&#39;re gonna get sick if</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.039" end="00:08:33.959" style="s2">this is real if this is or if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.419" end="00:08:36.630" style="s2">real thing where specifically their</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.959" end="00:08:38.910" style="s2">local adaptiveness will be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.630" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.910" end="00:08:43.410" style="s2">less than others now what you&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.610" end="00:08:47.100" style="s2">to say I think it&#39;s certainly come to my</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.410" end="00:08:49.080" style="s2">mind is they you know hardcore prepper</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.100" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">communities are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.080" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">indistinguishable from groups are</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:55.110" style="s2">actually making effective choices you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:56.540" style="s2">know in a larger context like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.110" end="00:08:58.650" style="s2">whole bunch of nodes</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.540" end="00:09:00.950" style="s2">there&#39;s whole bunch of solutions to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.650" end="00:09:03.150" style="s2">particular event that are probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.950" end="00:09:06.000" style="s2">equivalent in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.150" end="00:09:07.890" style="s2">adaptiveness unless think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.000" end="00:09:09.780" style="s2">really big right and so it&#39;s weird like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.890" end="00:09:11.940" style="s2">it&#39;s one of these things where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.780" end="00:09:14.370" style="s2">noticing as I&#39;m talking about it would</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.940" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">actually maybe be best for us if this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.370" end="00:09:19.740" style="s2">a bigger thing then it seems like it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:23.370" style="s2">might be because it would be a enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.740" end="00:09:27.570" style="s2">felt reality that it would push our</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.370" end="00:09:29.430" style="s2">consciousness past certain black holes</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.570" end="00:09:33.170" style="s2">that were in right now so more like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.430" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">Bronze Age collapse yeah which open</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.170" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">battle right you get this PC ation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:41.910" style="s2">all these news you know cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:46.050" style="s2">economic political forms of organization</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.910" end="00:09:47.400" style="s2">and cognition changes fundamentally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.050" end="00:09:49.410" style="s2">in fact of you see if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.400" end="00:09:51.750" style="s2">I could be thinking okay so we can go up</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.410" end="00:09:53.550" style="s2">you can say then the Chinese went</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.750" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">through that kind of dynamic what seven</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.550" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2">times like every every dynasty has gone</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">through a collapse that was on the order</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:02.970" style="s2">of like two-thirds mortality right in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">couple hundred years of chaos and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.970" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">that gave rise to the next dynasty it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">funny because the continuity of China</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:08.730" style="s2">which is different than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.900" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">discontinuity of the Bronze Age I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.730" end="00:10:14.010" style="s2">is precisely that more term attitude</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.660" style="s2">know we&#39;ve got some sixty percent to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.010" end="00:10:17.340" style="s2">seventy five percent or something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.660" end="00:10:19.080" style="s2">that you probably have no longer China</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.340" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2">to China you have something which is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.080" end="00:10:25.080" style="s2">know the Hittites</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:26.190" style="s2">to the Greeks yeah and then on the so</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.080" end="00:10:28.650" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got like some Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.190" end="00:10:30.120" style="s2">collapse the Chinese collapse the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.650" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">collapse and then like the Black Plague</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.120" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">something like that or the black plague</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.220" end="00:10:36.440" style="s2">awful as it was didn&#39;t really interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:39.030" style="s2">the continuity of the West</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.440" end="00:10:40.260" style="s2">it created a real the the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.030" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">came out the other end was very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.260" end="00:10:45.840" style="s2">different but I would say and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:47.580" style="s2">fundamentally was still still thought of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.840" end="00:10:49.470" style="s2">itself as the West at least yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.580" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuity of I there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.470" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">certain continuity of identity back</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.890" style="s2">beyond it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">yeah so this is you do the map all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.890" end="00:10:59.740" style="s2">way back down to the individual so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:05.110" style="s2">you&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s got your</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.740" end="00:11:07.000" style="s2">delusion or an addiction it&#39;s theirs how</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.110" end="00:11:09.070" style="s2">hard do you have to hit rock bottom to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.000" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">have your moment of clarity and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.070" end="00:11:13.330" style="s2">the question and ideally you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">to hit too hard the softer you can hit</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.330" end="00:11:15.550" style="s2">it&#39;s the moment of clarity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:17.950" style="s2">looking for it&#39;s not the rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.550" end="00:11:19.210" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for yeah yeah and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.950" end="00:11:20.830" style="s2">that&#39;s the question is how hard do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.210" end="00:11:23.140" style="s2">have to hit rock bottom to have an a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.830" end="00:11:26.080" style="s2">moment of clarity adequate to the amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.140" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">of change that we need to make in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.080" end="00:11:30.400" style="s2">interior and our exterior to be truly</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">adapted to the context that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.400" end="00:11:34.890" style="s2">finding ourselves in that&#39;s a good</p>
