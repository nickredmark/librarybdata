<p begin="00:03:54.870" end="00:04:03.810" style="s2">then a rebuilding we don&#39;t know that yet</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">of the difficulties again with this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.300" end="00:04:15.210" style="s2">this issue of leads and lags what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">have already initiated in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.210" end="00:04:20.600" style="s2">climate changes we were talking coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:22.680" style="s2">in the door that thirty years of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.600" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">difference between the emission of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.680" end="00:04:27.570" style="s2">carbon that amplified the seawater</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.700" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">we don&#39;t know where we are no neither do</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.510" end="00:04:42.780" style="s2">we know yet how wise intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">farsighted our response can be because</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.780" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">we haven&#39;t responded yet which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:51.140" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve been pretty stupid up to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">this point so fork in the road well</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.140" end="00:04:56.640" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:59.550" style="s2">even if we decide to take the fork</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.640" end="00:05:02.220" style="s2">toward opportunity we do not know for</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.550" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">sure where the opportunity itself has</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.220" end="00:05:09.240" style="s2">passed it may be that that&#39;s the fit</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:11.760" style="s2">that that&#39;s the nightmare scenario but I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:13.380" style="s2">think we ought to assume that it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.760" end="00:05:17.010" style="s2">passed that we can make something much</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:19.140" style="s2">better of this then otherwise would</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.010" end="00:05:22.860" style="s2">occur if we simply let nature take its</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.140" end="00:05:26.240" style="s2">course and run carbon emissions carbon</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.860" end="00:05:30.060" style="s2">levels in the atmosphere to 550 600 800</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.240" end="00:05:31.860" style="s2">1000 parts per million that truly would</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.060" end="00:05:35.240" style="s2">be the end of civilization by everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.860" end="00:05:39.150" style="s2">that we know now that would destroy us</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.240" end="00:05:41.640" style="s2">so a good question and that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.150" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">answer that&#39;s simply you&#39;ve defined I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.640" end="00:05:48.970" style="s2">think where we are at this moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.470" end="00:05:53.260" style="s2">and in the nature of design you speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.970" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">about the need to invent or reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.260" end="00:05:57.430" style="s2">idea of a sustainable human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:00.300" style="s2">and then distributed as widely as</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.430" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">possible and as quickly as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.300" end="00:06:06.010" style="s2">this very very much points towards it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:07.450" style="s2">not about nations against nations</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.010" end="00:06:09.850" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s about the survival of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.450" end="00:06:12.520" style="s2">humanity and on this planet could you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.850" end="00:06:18.180" style="s2">say a few more things about that well</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.520" end="00:06:20.140" style="s2">let me just say two things the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.180" end="00:06:24.460" style="s2">sustainability isn&#39;t just about</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.140" end="00:06:27.790" style="s2">technology and systems and housing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.460" end="00:06:30.340" style="s2">so forth it will be very much about</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.790" end="00:06:31.450" style="s2">it&#39;ll be won or lost on on battle of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.340" end="00:06:35.020" style="s2">equity and fairness</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.450" end="00:06:41.700" style="s2">there&#39;s no sustainable world that could</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.020" end="00:06:44.440" style="s2">be made around inequity and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.700" end="00:06:50.740" style="s2">inequitable world that we would want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.440" end="00:06:52.750" style="s2">sustain anyway the the politics of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.740" end="00:06:54.940" style="s2">are going to be particularly troubling</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.750" end="00:06:58.900" style="s2">it&#39;ll be much easier to see how we make</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.940" end="00:07:02.290" style="s2">solar collectors then how we make a</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.900" end="00:07:05.290" style="s2">solar-powered civilization that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.290" end="00:07:07.330" style="s2">to be require a level of political</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.290" end="00:07:10.300" style="s2">inventiveness that we haven&#39;t seen on</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.330" end="00:07:14.230" style="s2">this planet the corporation I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.300" end="00:07:18.190" style="s2">peculiarly maladapted institution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.230" end="00:07:23.110" style="s2">adapted to extraction of materials and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.190" end="00:07:26.760" style="s2">to endless economic growth those are</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.110" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">assumptions we can no longer safely hold</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.760" end="00:07:36.280" style="s2">and so what the politics will be and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:40.410" style="s2">politics that says that our</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.280" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">great-great-grandchildren have standing</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.410" end="00:07:49.780" style="s2">which is to say a right to stop</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">parts of our behavior that deprive them</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.780" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">in terms of our constitution of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:59.780" style="s2">liberty and property</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:08:02.060" style="s2">so sustainability and ecologic InDesign</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.780" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">or about seeming world as a system and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.060" end="00:08:07.370" style="s2">the interconnections over long periods</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:09.160" style="s2">of time those are two fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.370" end="00:08:11.410" style="s2">changes and they run against virtually</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:13.490" style="s2">everything that we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.410" end="00:08:17.240" style="s2">scientifically and technologically in</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.490" end="00:08:19.970" style="s2">the past 300 years our science is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.240" end="00:08:23.120" style="s2">preceded by disaggregation not by</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.970" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">aggregation it&#39;s preceded in small steps</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:29.480" style="s2">without adequate regard for the most</p>
