<p begin="00:00:10.920" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">each take up to five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">to answer that question and then have an</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">open discussion about what everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:26.550" style="s2">else&#39;s answers generated for us who</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.720" end="00:00:28.980" style="s2">would like to start I can go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.550" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">start I know do believe started a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.980" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">these yeah although I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:41.190" style="s2">a whole bunch to say I got interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">the game B concept because I would like</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.190" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">to spend more time helping other helping</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:53.219" style="s2">other people in a exponential way and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:55.399" style="s2">some of the concepts in there seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.219" end="00:01:00.300" style="s2">you know kind of anti rival risks and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.399" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">you know having everyone contribute some</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.300" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">of those ideas I found interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">had been you know aligning with some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">the stuff I&#39;ve been working on for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">last couple years of group discussion so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">I kind of see it as a way to kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:21.479" style="s2">more participatory and kind of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">look at how we&#39;re doing things and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.479" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">the broader sense like society and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">world and culturally and what are some</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">things that we want to keep and order</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">some things that we want to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:41.430" style="s2">on to try to improve that&#39;s it should</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">probably unlike myself first or I mute</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.430" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">myself it&#39;s funny for I was looking down</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">getting the timer ready while you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">talking minute alright we&#39;re not Eric</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">and to welcome Eric I think Eric if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">put on some headphones we&#39;re getting an</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">echo I don&#39;t know if you can all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">do you want to go next friend so do want</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:12.850" style="s2">me to go next you go ahead all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:16.500" style="s2">excuse me everybody else and start my</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.850" end="00:02:19.060" style="s2">own reset go all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.500" end="00:02:23.080" style="s2">game B what does it mean to me it means</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.060" end="00:02:24.850" style="s2">everything as I have already in my head</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.080" end="00:02:26.380" style="s2">come up with the way that we dismantle</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.850" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">capitalism and create a new world that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.380" end="00:02:33.520" style="s2">works for everyone and how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.030" end="00:02:35.500" style="s2">from a space of out competing game a on</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.520" end="00:02:37.240" style="s2">its own turf that it has to come out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.500" end="00:02:40.510" style="s2">gaming and it has to do better than game</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.240" end="00:02:42.070" style="s2">a and be safe enough to try and that all</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.510" end="00:02:45.100" style="s2">happened before I encountered game B in</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.070" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">September and now having people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.100" end="00:02:50.650" style="s2">speak that language even though I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.960" style="s2">know the language of Omni win of and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.650" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">even if I disagree that you know they</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.960" end="00:02:56.110" style="s2">want to like tape we take a lot of steps</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">back and do all the interpersonal work</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.110" end="00:02:59.620" style="s2">that I feel like I&#39;ve been doing and yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:02.320" style="s2">I still need people to do that with I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.620" end="00:03:04.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think you can figure it all out in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.320" end="00:03:06.460" style="s2">isolation and I&#39;d already kind of let go</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.180" end="00:03:08.140" style="s2">of my idea in a way that it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.460" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">to be mine it doesn&#39;t have to be this</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:12.840" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:16.120" style="s2">but to recreate something together that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.840" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">brings individual autonomy that&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.120" end="00:03:19.720" style="s2">about the individual giving up their</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:21.100" style="s2">power to the group but is about a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.720" end="00:03:22.990" style="s2">of autonomous people coming together</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.100" end="00:03:24.910" style="s2">creating something creating the tools</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.990" end="00:03:27.220" style="s2">they need to be able to work in smaller</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.910" end="00:03:28.450" style="s2">groups for the benefit of themselves the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.220" end="00:03:31.060" style="s2">benefit of the group and the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.450" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">the entire whole and we all get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.060" end="00:03:34.960" style="s2">benefit in in those pieces and so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.950" end="00:03:38.410" style="s2">is what game B is to me it&#39;s Omni win</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.960" end="00:03:40.750" style="s2">solutions it&#39;s looking at our own</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.410" end="00:03:44.230" style="s2">individual lives and figuring out why</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">and how being raised within game a what</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.230" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">part of that is efficient water what</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.140" style="s2">part of that is like how am I being</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:52.150" style="s2">rivalries how am i how do I create Omni</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.140" end="00:03:53.380" style="s2">win solutions when there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.150" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2">that wants to compete when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.380" end="00:04:01.060" style="s2">part of me that wants to do better have</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.100" end="00:04:05.620" style="s2">more and there&#39;s the logical part that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.060" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">also knows I have that I&#39;m gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.620" end="00:04:09.780" style="s2">what everyone else has to give and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:12.580" style="s2">more I give and the more they give and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.780" end="00:04:15.070" style="s2">not required everyone give up all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.580" end="00:04:16.900" style="s2">themselves and become a selfless human</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.070" end="00:04:21.940" style="s2">being that&#39;s basically entered a cult</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.900" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">how to put a toe in the water be like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:26.290" style="s2">how do we cooperate a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:26.680" style="s2">how do we see the benefit of that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.290" end="00:04:29.470" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.680" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">the enjoyment it brings individually so</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.470" end="00:04:33.669" style="s2">it grows and how do you work with two</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:35.020" style="s2">people Bentley and me creating the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.669" end="00:04:36.669" style="s2">cafe and then how do you bring more</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.020" end="00:04:38.440" style="s2">people on board and have it work and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.669" end="00:04:43.000" style="s2">do you how do you have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:44.380" style="s2">and a system to create things with</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.000" end="00:04:45.940" style="s2">dozens of people hundreds of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.380" end="00:04:48.430" style="s2">thousands of people and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.940" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">billions of people that is effective and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.430" end="00:04:53.259" style="s2">actually works but still isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">billions having control over those even</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.259" end="00:04:57.550" style="s2">the one how do you keep bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:00.100" style="s2">and it is the individual the group the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.550" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">global all at once and a lot of that can</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.100" end="00:05:04.389" style="s2">be done or started with the tools on</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">technology which is why that is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.389" end="00:05:07.240" style="s2">concentrating on and I&#39;m also not going</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.910" style="s2">to take five minutes because I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.240" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">that was a lot and I&#39;m going on mic</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.910" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">everyone else can go next</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">alright Brent or Eric would either of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">you like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.250" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">I&#39;ll go I guess hmm I think of game B in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:33.150" style="s2">terms of a paradigm shift which which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:36.490" style="s2">both sort of an overused term but also</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.150" end="00:05:39.160" style="s2">underrated because if you take it</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.490" end="00:05:41.979" style="s2">seriously it makes it more difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.160" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">kind of you know prove the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.979" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">shift and precisely locate it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:48.669" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do right and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:51.639" style="s2">something like revolutions happen quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.669" end="00:05:53.699" style="s2">often in a global context and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.639" end="00:05:57.250" style="s2">historically they&#39;re kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.699" end="00:06:00.159" style="s2">marching forward or backwards depending</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.250" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">on the type but that&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.159" end="00:06:02.770" style="s2">here between a revolution in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:04.389" style="s2">paradigm shift like if they they</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.770" end="00:06:07.510" style="s2">definitely will coincide like I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.389" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">the US needs a political revolution um</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.510" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">but but a paradigm shift is when</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">everything changes like the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">paradigm being the kind of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.990" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">zeitgeist all these sorts of things so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:22.060" style="s2">I think I think there&#39;s some flaws with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">the game a game be framing it&#39;s it can</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.060" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">be overly simplistic but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:28.090" style="s2">salient in the sense that like if we say</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:30.220" style="s2">okay everything historically is game a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.090" end="00:06:34.719" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of brought us to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.220" end="00:06:38.320" style="s2">point like capitalism communism war mm</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.719" end="00:06:40.419" style="s2">um is kind of gay game a the way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.320" end="00:06:44.319" style="s2">kind of unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.419" end="00:06:45.879" style="s2">developed as a civilization then we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.319" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">recognize we have to change you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.879" end="00:06:50.469" style="s2">because of like as from October gir</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:52.139" style="s2">unpacks things like generator functions</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.469" end="00:06:54.930" style="s2">these things that are built-in to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.139" end="00:07:00.219" style="s2">creating the pathologies down the road</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.930" end="00:07:02.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve got this this concept I developed I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.219" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t invent the term but I but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.830" end="00:07:05.979" style="s2">not very well defined in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:08.979" style="s2">so I wrote an article on social</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.979" end="00:07:12.789" style="s2">paradoxes it&#39;s called social paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.979" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">and meta problems and and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.789" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">also kind of captures what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:20.229" style="s2">about and and like with generator</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:22.120" style="s2">functions because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.229" end="00:07:24.819" style="s2">pathologies are built into the decisions</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.120" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">we make even if it&#39;s just consumption or</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.819" end="00:07:30.159" style="s2">you know how you know population growth</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:33.250" style="s2">whatever its kind of built in so to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.159" end="00:07:37.240" style="s2">overcome paradoxes and especially social</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.250" end="00:07:39.250" style="s2">paradoxes is incredibly complex and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.240" end="00:07:44.409" style="s2">difficult right like it&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.250" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">they&#39;re paradoxes so meaning there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.409" end="00:07:52.629" style="s2">strategies to to overcome them one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">called normative incremental ism where</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.629" end="00:07:58.900" style="s2">you have kind of values that you that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">you uh kind of set as attractors and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.900" end="00:08:09.669" style="s2">then agree to work together towards that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:11.830" style="s2">so I think you know I I guess as much</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.669" end="00:08:14.650" style="s2">that&#39;s as much as I want to say in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.830" end="00:08:20.259" style="s2">nutshell of about it but I&#39;ll repeat</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.650" end="00:08:24.939" style="s2">that like I said in a previous cafe mmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.259" end="00:08:27.069" style="s2">I I come I come to this community of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.939" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">from a perspective of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.069" end="00:08:32.829" style="s2">Mehta modernism and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">paradigm shift from from postmodern post</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.829" end="00:08:39.789" style="s2">modernism and post modernity as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:41.740" style="s2">to kind of coming into it getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.789" end="00:08:45.100" style="s2">through through Brett Weinstein and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.740" end="00:08:48.970" style="s2">and his perspectives but I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.100" end="00:08:52.660" style="s2">there&#39;s furfle potential to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.970" end="00:08:54.160" style="s2">see how these things converge and we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.660" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.160" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">a day-by-day work work through this</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">paradigm shift Thank You Brent all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">Eric would you like to go or would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:24.879" style="s2">like to just have a discuss so I&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:27.730" style="s2">how much I can remember so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.879" end="00:09:32.379" style="s2">paradigm shift I have to agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.730" end="00:09:34.089" style="s2">but I think you sort of alluded we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.379" end="00:09:35.649" style="s2">answering the question what does game be</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.089" end="00:09:40.839" style="s2">mean to me and then after we&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.649" end="00:09:44.319" style="s2">conversation okay it was it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.839" end="00:09:47.740" style="s2">okay so what is going be mean to me I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.319" end="00:09:50.829" style="s2">don&#39;t get I guess fundamentally at its</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.740" end="00:09:52.990" style="s2">base game B is what it is among other</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.829" end="00:09:57.490" style="s2">things what game a is not so if game a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.990" end="00:09:59.759" style="s2">is foundationally characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.490" end="00:10:02.259" style="s2">people competing with each other for</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.759" end="00:10:04.569" style="s2">advantage in some way whether that be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.259" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">rethought status wealth whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.569" end="00:10:07.810" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:10.019" style="s2">but the game a is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.810" end="00:10:13.480" style="s2">characterized by their game B is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.019" end="00:10:15.430" style="s2">collaborative cooperative on rival way</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.480" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">so the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.430" end="00:10:19.240" style="s2">the other thing that it means to me is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s and this is the big</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.240" end="00:10:23.649" style="s2">appeal for me is that it&#39;s built on</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">something which to me seems meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.649" end="00:10:31.300" style="s2">solid namely good people sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:33.180" style="s2">individual and and and that again and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.300" end="00:10:38.260" style="s2">again and again know people who I admire</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.180" end="00:10:39.820" style="s2">can&#39;t be returned &#39;ti I&#39;m bad and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.260" end="00:10:41.580" style="s2">people that brought me to it affirmed</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.820" end="00:10:44.170" style="s2">this again and again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.580" end="00:10:48.459" style="s2">sitting around and talk about one thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:50.770" style="s2">but they&#39;re doing it and something which</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.459" end="00:10:52.779" style="s2">slightly bothers me about Wayne way game</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.770" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">spoken back by her questions about and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.779" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">but you know after game be then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">game see you know because game be you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:06.490" style="s2">think about game being that way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">just another structure of some kind it</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.490" end="00:11:09.610" style="s2">may be a different structure but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">just another structure at some point and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.610" end="00:11:13.140" style="s2">so game be for me is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:21.529" style="s2">flexible space which acknowledges the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.759" end="00:11:23.149" style="s2">things change all the time right special</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.529" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">moves leading with the complex things</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.149" end="00:11:27.019" style="s2">change time and so game B is not about</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.399" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">putting a different structure into base</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.019" end="00:11:31.850" style="s2">more flexible structures more adept</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:34.310" style="s2">structure it if the thing which allows</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.850" end="00:11:36.949" style="s2">the formation and dissolution of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.310" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">structures as they are necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.949" end="00:11:40.519" style="s2">then later become unnecessary or</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:43.220" style="s2">outdated or have been improved upon in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.519" end="00:11:45.620" style="s2">some way whatever and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.220" end="00:11:48.199" style="s2">meta thing it&#39;s not a thing it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.620" end="00:11:50.690" style="s2">a it&#39;s a better thing in that thing I</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.199" end="00:11:52.040" style="s2">wrote I don&#39;t know if any ready I sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.690" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">of alluded to it like that dowel right</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.040" end="00:11:59.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a formless nameless thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:12:01.870" style="s2">it&#39;s characterized by certain feelings</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.540" end="00:12:01.870" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.580" end="00:12:06.390" style="s2">not poisoning the well in any way not</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.920" end="00:12:07.740" style="s2">just in your interpersonal relationships</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.390" end="00:12:09.690" style="s2">but in the broader relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.740" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">with nature in the cosmos at large yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.690" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">sir that knot was wealthy have I gone on</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:17.550" style="s2">too long already</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:20.070" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of into a kind of onto a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.550" end="00:12:25.980" style="s2">runaway flown so yeah is that the game B</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.070" end="00:12:28.860" style="s2">to me is about a set of emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.980" end="00:12:32.089" style="s2">feelings kind of but the emotions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.860" end="00:12:34.170" style="s2">the wrong word but principles and values</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.089" end="00:12:36.269" style="s2">which are not set in stone</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.170" end="00:12:42.360" style="s2">again they couldn&#39;t really be spoken but</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.269" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a apart connection is a part</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.360" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">of it well okay I&#39;m going to stop there</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.570" end="00:12:53.460" style="s2">all right your mic was cutting not in</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:54.540" style="s2">and out but like quieter louder a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.460" end="00:12:57.390" style="s2">while I was we were listening so</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.540" end="00:12:59.850" style="s2">hopefully that&#39;s within within that also</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.390" end="00:13:03.330" style="s2">um Brett your chair is squeaking I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.850" end="00:13:05.240" style="s2">know if everyone else but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.330" end="00:13:08.220" style="s2">sensitive to sound</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.240" end="00:13:09.180" style="s2">myself when I&#39;m not talking all right</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.220" end="00:13:11.910" style="s2">sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.180" end="00:13:16.230" style="s2">all right and other than that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.910" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">have an an open discussion for now what</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.230" end="00:13:20.400" style="s2">game being what other people said that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:26.130" style="s2">resonated with us and what it what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.400" end="00:13:32.780" style="s2">brought up as I&#39;m saying before the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.130" end="00:13:35.190" style="s2">paradigm shift idea that phrase used but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.780" end="00:13:38.760" style="s2">again kind of alluding to what I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.190" end="00:13:41.480" style="s2">saying in the doctoral bit it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.760" end="00:13:44.270" style="s2">really a different paradigm it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.480" end="00:13:47.340" style="s2">the ability to install and uninstall</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.270" end="00:13:49.170" style="s2">appropriate paradigms for that thing for</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.340" end="00:13:51.210" style="s2">that modality whatever&#39;s like trans</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.170" end="00:13:52.500" style="s2">paradigm attic know what I mean what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.210" end="00:13:55.110" style="s2">is to me though that this is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.500" end="00:13:58.410" style="s2">to me I see you nodding would you agree</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.110" end="00:14:01.350" style="s2">with that idea yeah I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.410" end="00:14:04.860" style="s2">place for that approach we do have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.350" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">think of this in terms of um you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.860" end="00:14:08.670" style="s2">whether it&#39;s switching paradigms or</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:10.260" style="s2">intermingling paradigms without</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.670" end="00:14:12.210" style="s2">compromising right so there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.260" end="00:14:15.510" style="s2">difference between conscious capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.210" end="00:14:19.430" style="s2">and post capitalism as concepts as</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.510" end="00:14:22.500" style="s2">discourses so I think you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.430" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a role for trans paradigm attic</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.500" end="00:14:27.030" style="s2">thinking and and met a paradigmatic for</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:30.210" style="s2">sure because there are it&#39;s not always</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.030" end="00:14:32.520" style="s2">as clear as okay there&#39;s one paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.210" end="00:14:36.450" style="s2">and now there&#39;s a you know now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.520" end="00:14:38.460" style="s2">new one like from you know mmm you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.450" end="00:14:41.010" style="s2">geocentric to heliocentric it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.460" end="00:14:45.030" style="s2">always that clear so like the the term</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.010" end="00:14:47.570" style="s2">paradigm can be used loosely if you if</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.970" end="00:18:09.650" style="s2">right it&#39;s kind of a an extension of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:23.630" style="s2">wanted to kind of develop it as a</p>

<p begin="00:18:23.630" end="00:18:28.870" style="s2">kind of co-creative generative process</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.830" end="00:18:59.210" style="s2">that&#39;s all it&#39;s our baseline right so</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.500" end="00:19:01.370" style="s2">that you know game be supposed to return</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.210" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">to how we were rather than it being</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.370" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">anything fundamentally new so again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a grounded sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:15.050" style="s2">interconnectedness I think that the very</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.130" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">very heart of it if you do have an</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.550" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">that has to be the that has to be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.760" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">foundation of it and did the systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:37.670" style="s2">change yeah the the tech stuff Springs</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:39.830" style="s2">must spring from that you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.670" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">art and everything else must spring from</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.830" end="00:19:48.980" style="s2">that for me that&#39;s that&#39;s so I I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">concern about that is that in most of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.980" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">what I do every day it&#39;s it&#39;s game a and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that I can make that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:20:04.120" style="s2">transition to that feeling of game B as</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:06.500" style="s2">long as I&#39;m being bombarded by game a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.120" end="00:20:08.870" style="s2">because I have to I you know during the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.500" end="00:20:11.330" style="s2">day I have to defend myself I have to I</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.330" end="00:20:19.240" style="s2">to get food I have to compete so if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:25.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have some tech or some safe space</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.240" end="00:20:28.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I can keep that essence of</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.550" end="00:20:42.020" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s a really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.490" end="00:20:46.870" style="s2">point Bentley I think like everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.020" end="00:20:49.850" style="s2">to be aware aware of that um I know uh</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.850" end="00:20:56.210" style="s2">actually enables us to opt out of game a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.780" end="00:20:57.980" style="s2">quite easily I mean it&#39;s hard for me to</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.980" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">you know roughly speaking uh cuz I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.250" end="00:21:05.720" style="s2">mean this is it&#39;s been it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">challenge for many many years but it got</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.720" end="00:21:08.390" style="s2">to a point where I just couldn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.940" style="s2">write a cover letter</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.390" end="00:21:14.360" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t apply for a job I couldn&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.360" end="00:21:19.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very connected to this discourse</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.400" end="00:21:22.610" style="s2">practices right you get to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.080" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">you just can&#39;t do it anymore and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.610" end="00:21:26.950" style="s2">your choices then are to you know die</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:31.070" style="s2">and be homeless or if you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.950" end="00:21:32.570" style="s2">you&#39;ll get support and then you can you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.070" end="00:21:34.460" style="s2">can kind of commit yourself to it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.570" end="00:21:37.730" style="s2">say okay I&#39;m not going back I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:39.170" style="s2">to go you know oh I&#39;ll get by on a</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.170" end="00:21:44.540" style="s2">and try to you know make money in the</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.540" end="00:21:49.610" style="s2">gig to gig if it&#39;s ethical if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.790" end="00:21:51.770" style="s2">interesting right otherwise then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.610" end="00:21:54.740" style="s2">know I can say no or not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.770" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">qualified or whatever so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.740" end="00:22:00.470" style="s2">important point it seems to be to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:02.420" style="s2">that the people who I guess there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.470" end="00:22:07.160" style="s2">three groups of people creating game be</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.420" end="00:22:09.170" style="s2">is those who have somewhat one at game a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.160" end="00:22:12.770" style="s2">those who have the money and the power</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.170" end="00:22:15.740" style="s2">and the ability much like Jordan Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.770" end="00:22:17.720" style="s2">Hall and Brett Brett Wayne Weinstein and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.740" end="00:22:20.270" style="s2">and such that the I mean they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.720" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">enough of the the backing that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.270" end="00:22:24.770" style="s2">don&#39;t have to compete in game Akon so</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">they&#39;re competing in game a but they</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.770" end="00:22:28.520" style="s2">have more freedoms as now compete with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.560" style="s2">in game be people like I&#39;m assuming</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.520" end="00:22:32.840" style="s2">Bentley who are like right I have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.560" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">work a job I have to fit this in between</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.840" end="00:22:37.700" style="s2">and find space to make that more viable</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:40.340" style="s2">and then people like Brent and I who</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.700" end="00:22:44.210" style="s2">have kind of lost game a right like</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.340" end="00:22:46.250" style="s2">health-wise I can tell I&#39;m never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.210" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">compete in game a I&#39;m never gonna win</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.250" end="00:22:49.400" style="s2">that and with people like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:51.170" style="s2">Peterson or like well if you just tap</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.400" end="00:22:52.910" style="s2">into your ingenuity I&#39;m like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.170" end="00:22:54.200" style="s2">know what my might like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.910" end="00:22:55.850" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been through you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.200" end="00:22:58.070" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to have your mind changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.850" end="00:22:59.930" style="s2">like literally like have your brain have</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.070" end="00:23:03.770" style="s2">damage to it that you can&#39;t do what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.930" end="00:23:06.290" style="s2">used to do but in tapping into instead</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.770" end="00:23:08.750" style="s2">of can I compete in game a what do I</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.290" end="00:23:10.730" style="s2">have to contribute that&#39;s a compliment</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.750" end="00:23:12.530" style="s2">is Omni win everybody has something to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.730" end="00:23:15.320" style="s2">contribute everybody and then the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.530" end="00:23:19.310" style="s2">work able to contribute as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.320" end="00:23:21.260" style="s2">the more is a collective we have more</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.310" end="00:23:24.110" style="s2">and more to gain and so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.260" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">important to not to allow all three of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.110" end="00:23:28.670" style="s2">those groups to you know that like</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:30.440" style="s2">there&#39;s those of us who may not have the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.670" end="00:23:32.840" style="s2">financial capability but we have time</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.440" end="00:23:34.850" style="s2">and we have our own ideas and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.840" end="00:23:36.620" style="s2">certain amount to contribute because</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.850" end="00:23:38.330" style="s2">we&#39;re losing game a and there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.620" end="00:23:40.010" style="s2">who have the opposite who are winning a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.330" end="00:23:42.440" style="s2">game a have the power have the money to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.010" end="00:23:43.940" style="s2">contribute and if they&#39;re winning at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:46.160" style="s2">so they can&#39;t see all the broken pieces</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.940" end="00:23:50.480" style="s2">as easily as people who maybe aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.160" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">winning at it is my understanding right</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.480" end="00:23:52.540" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.350" end="00:24:01.020" style="s2">well if I can talk because I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.430" end="00:24:02.940" style="s2">take the discussion in a different</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.020" end="00:24:04.860" style="s2">direction so if you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.940" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2">well I was just I was just gonna jump</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.860" end="00:24:13.950" style="s2">back what you said about keeping the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:16.770" style="s2">spirit of game be alive play game a day</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.950" end="00:24:22.470" style="s2">right and I think as Brent said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.770" end="00:24:24.870" style="s2">very valid this is also we can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.470" end="00:24:26.010" style="s2">into until it has to all happen at once</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.870" end="00:24:28.950" style="s2">you know what I mean that until the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.010" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">whole world is is like that then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.950" end="00:24:31.650" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">conflict it&#39;s been game a and game B</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.650" end="00:24:37.020" style="s2">until unless the sudden flip and</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:39.060" style="s2">everybody goes at once so this is always</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.020" end="00:24:41.310" style="s2">what makes the idea of transition so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.060" end="00:24:43.140" style="s2">very very very difficult because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.310" end="00:24:47.400" style="s2">have this tension between these two</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.140" end="00:24:52.110" style="s2">fundamentally but it just made me think</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.400" end="00:24:53.550" style="s2">of the you know yeah you can see what</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.110" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">the problems are you can see what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.550" end="00:24:57.030" style="s2">solutions are how you get from here to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">there is the impossible bit right you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.030" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">know you must&#39;ve heard the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:03.750" style="s2">yourself a million times right and just</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">and I think that is part of why that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:12.390" style="s2">such a big problem individual on</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:13.710" style="s2">Facebook right sorry no that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.390" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s I guess that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:21.390" style="s2">kind of focus is what&#39;s what are these</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:22.770" style="s2">kind of small steps and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.390" end="00:25:24.150" style="s2">Jubilee and I are kind of working on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.770" end="00:25:26.100" style="s2">tech side even though a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.150" end="00:25:29.670" style="s2">think that that&#39;s kind of premature</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:34.200" style="s2">we&#39;re just trying to give ourselves some</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.670" end="00:25:36.930" style="s2">space and maybe find me and income kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.200" end="00:25:39.260" style="s2">of building an experiment for game B on</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.930" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">some of the concepts that we know so far</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.260" end="00:25:45.090" style="s2">but I was also thinking you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:46.770" style="s2">talk about the the feeling that it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.090" end="00:25:48.630" style="s2">and that it is and I think Brent when</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.770" end="00:25:50.280" style="s2">you&#39;re saying paradigm changes not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.630" end="00:25:52.460" style="s2">a societal paradigm change it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.280" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">paradigm change within each individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.460" end="00:25:57.900" style="s2">and I think someone is doing some</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">training on that to kind of help people</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.900" end="00:26:02.650" style="s2">make that transition are there any other</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:06.190" style="s2">active</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.650" end="00:26:10.810" style="s2">things in activities that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.190" end="00:26:14.770" style="s2">in the game bSpace that are building</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.810" end="00:26:17.980" style="s2">that emotional state or safe space I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.770" end="00:26:19.750" style="s2">mean like this is hopefully but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.980" end="00:26:21.280" style="s2">involved it&#39;s Eric and I are meeting</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.750" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">tomorrow with a group of people to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.280" end="00:26:25.150" style="s2">practice a mega rule and practice and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:27.220" style="s2">him and I are meeting to do circling</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.150" end="00:26:28.870" style="s2">which i think is very the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.220" end="00:26:30.970" style="s2">create the tech that supports those kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.870" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">of things because you can zoom but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.970" end="00:26:37.930" style="s2">more that we&#39;re benefiting from that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:39.340" style="s2">can transport it or you know offer it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.930" end="00:26:41.050" style="s2">a way that it&#39;s easy for people to come</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.340" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">on board right where they might not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.050" end="00:26:43.480" style="s2">able to be part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:46.300" style="s2">we&#39;re having because there&#39;s five of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.480" end="00:26:47.350" style="s2">right that kind of is the the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.300" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">where we you know we don&#39;t want more</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.350" end="00:26:50.410" style="s2">people joining that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:53.380" style="s2">necessarily but to be able to join their</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.410" end="00:26:54.520" style="s2">own conversations yes I want to practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.380" end="00:26:56.980" style="s2">I&#39;ll make a rule right where are my</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.520" end="00:26:58.390" style="s2">people to practice it with and the more</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.980" end="00:26:59.590" style="s2">we can create the technology that makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.390" end="00:27:01.270" style="s2">that easier which is I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.590" end="00:27:03.040" style="s2">concentrating on on the idea cafe is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.270" end="00:27:04.690" style="s2">like how you bring people together how</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.040" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">you get that scheduling piece right how</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.690" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">you get the underlining tech piece right</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:10.810" style="s2">to meet people where they&#39;re at right</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:12.520" style="s2">that it&#39;s hard to sometimes get people</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.810" end="00:27:13.960" style="s2">together it&#39;s a little bit vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.520" end="00:27:18.730" style="s2">put yourself out there and ask hey is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.960" end="00:27:23.830" style="s2">anyone interested in this and creating</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.730" end="00:27:25.450" style="s2">that that piece of it yeah so we have so</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.830" end="00:27:27.900" style="s2">it kind of the activities going on is we</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.450" end="00:27:30.490" style="s2">have we have these and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.900" end="00:27:34.300" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about practicing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.490" end="00:27:38.590" style="s2">Omega rule I don&#39;t know I guess I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.300" end="00:27:41.650" style="s2">to see a list of all that is kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.590" end="00:27:45.700" style="s2">the onboarding piece that&#39;s still a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.650" end="00:27:51.610" style="s2">of a challenge is it not to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.700" end="00:27:53.290" style="s2">extent anyway up to big grid out so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.610" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">know again the things like rule Omega</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.290" end="00:28:00.310" style="s2">and certain these are practices to build</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:28:02.590" style="s2">capacities at an individual group level</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.310" end="00:28:05.230" style="s2">right which can then be applied out in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.590" end="00:28:08.140" style="s2">by the world as hopefully as both</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.230" end="00:28:11.500" style="s2">Aerodyne shift in more and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.140" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">individual so I yeah you two you guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.500" end="00:28:14.110" style="s2">are focusing on the tech which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:16.620" style="s2">essential don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.110" end="00:28:19.620" style="s2">downplaying it&#39;s not my thing me</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.620" end="00:28:22.100" style="s2">it&#39;s that this is all about building my</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.620" end="00:28:25.020" style="s2">capacity at a selfish level but also</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.100" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">engaging in the process of collectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.020" end="00:28:32.039" style="s2">building path to a and understand and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:45.690" style="s2">open mind and see things have no job but</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.039" end="00:28:46.919" style="s2">and so on and so on I can understand a</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.690" end="00:28:48.750" style="s2">lot of what you&#39;re saying Eric because</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.919" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">of the mic I don&#39;t know if anyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.750" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">is having the same the same level of</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:53.850" style="s2">problems but I think a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:56.220" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is important but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.850" end="00:28:58.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite register because of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.220" end="00:28:59.880" style="s2">in a note that is kind of hard and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.200" end="00:29:01.289" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you got a loose cable or</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.880" end="00:29:06.210" style="s2">something but it&#39;s kind of fading in and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.289" end="00:29:08.400" style="s2">out but I think I got most of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.210" end="00:29:10.950" style="s2">before I was and now it&#39;s getting light</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.400" end="00:29:12.870" style="s2">but in the highest and lows or like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.950" end="00:29:20.520" style="s2">cutting out in the lows for me on my</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.870" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">ends but yeah no no it&#39;s gone we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.520" end="00:29:25.110" style="s2">we&#39;re coming to the ends of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">for you Sydney around 30 minutes so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.110" end="00:29:30.140" style="s2">we can um schedule a more afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.150" end="00:29:38.070" style="s2">what we can do generally speaking is we</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:39.539" style="s2">stop recording and then we go unlive so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.070" end="00:29:42.150" style="s2">that we can then vote on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.539" end="00:29:43.830" style="s2">we want to publish it or delete it or</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.150" end="00:29:45.419" style="s2">keep it private or what however we want</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.830" end="00:29:47.490" style="s2">to do that and we can also continue the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.419" end="00:29:49.530" style="s2">conversation but I&#39;ll give everyone a</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.490" end="00:29:51.270" style="s2">chance to wrap up to say there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.530" end="00:30:00.059" style="s2">closing thoughts before we stop</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.270" end="00:30:03.630" style="s2">recording on the same orders before okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.059" end="00:30:05.730" style="s2">oh and I really appreciated hearing</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.630" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">everyone&#39;s opinions I&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.730" end="00:30:11.159" style="s2">curious about that because game B is so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:13.950" style="s2">amorphous right now and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.159" end="00:30:19.559" style="s2">difficult space for me I like boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.950" end="00:30:25.020" style="s2">and they make me feel safe and rules but</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.559" end="00:30:27.990" style="s2">I&#39;ll be you know learning kind of all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.020" end="00:30:29.290" style="s2">this all the felt stuff and growing in</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.990" end="00:30:32.500" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.290" end="00:30:36.870" style="s2">and then I kind of look forward to a day</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.500" end="00:30:41.800" style="s2">where I can be less competitive in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.870" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">having to fund myself so kind of I kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.800" end="00:30:45.400" style="s2">of hopefully get this rolling</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:47.260" style="s2">I mean I met a really good work</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.400" end="00:30:50.500" style="s2">environment and I&#39;m not competitive on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.260" end="00:30:51.790" style="s2">day-to-day basis in that but when I try</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.500" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">about hat thinking about having more</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.790" end="00:30:54.970" style="s2">time to donate to this and I think well</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.040" style="s2">I need to become a contractor so I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.970" end="00:30:58.810" style="s2">lower my hours and focus more time on</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.040" end="00:31:01.960" style="s2">game B and then I&#39;m like well that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.810" end="00:31:06.070" style="s2">really competing if I&#39;m a contractor in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.960" end="00:31:12.100" style="s2">a lot of cases so but I look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.070" end="00:31:14.770" style="s2">hearing more there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.100" end="00:31:18.600" style="s2">you know game B is not not here yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.770" end="00:31:20.980" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it in the future</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.600" end="00:31:23.170" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a lot of concepts out</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.980" end="00:31:25.780" style="s2">there or you know and you can say all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.170" end="00:31:29.310" style="s2">the kind of march of history is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.780" end="00:31:32.380" style="s2">baby steps in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.310" end="00:31:34.780" style="s2">notwithstanding you know the generator</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.380" end="00:31:36.250" style="s2">functions and negative externalities</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.780" end="00:31:37.990" style="s2">that might destroy us</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.250" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">you know like things like the civil</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.990" end="00:31:42.910" style="s2">rights movements are obviously steps in</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:45.850" style="s2">the right direction but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.910" end="00:31:48.700" style="s2">a lot of concepts that that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:51.130" style="s2">can we can have two columns between game</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.700" end="00:31:54.310" style="s2">a and game B II tentatively you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.130" end="00:32:01.330" style="s2">things like D growth you know post</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.310" end="00:32:02.860" style="s2">capitalism a steady state economy you</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.330" end="00:32:04.330" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.860" end="00:32:06.550" style="s2">conceptual frameworks out there and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.330" end="00:32:13.330" style="s2">we&#39;re I think still in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.550" end="00:32:16.540" style="s2">mapping that whole discourse Thank You</p>
