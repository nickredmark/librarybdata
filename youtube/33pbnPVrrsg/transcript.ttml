<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">politics seems so crazy right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">is that the governing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:14.640" style="s2">across the wealthiest parts of our</p>

<p begin="00:01:14.640" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">the huge institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">things like media and music and money</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">and pharma and education and</p>

<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:31.040" style="s2">are in fact becoming super decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.439" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">and hard to govern all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.040" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">money and power and control of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:37.360" style="s2">things are not being held</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:39.439" style="s2">nearly as tightly as they used to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.360" end="00:01:42.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve all watched the disintegration</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.439" end="00:01:44.079" style="s2">of power across many of these different</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.159" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.079" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s no wonder as each one of them</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:51.479" style="s2">begins to fall</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">that they all fall prey to the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.479" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">decentralization of power it for sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">makes you stop and think about where</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">everything&#39;s headed</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">i know that&#39;s not what i had signed up</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">for when i initially started to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">to jordan greenhall i thought we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">going to talk about nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">and smart drugs and that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">started but in short order</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:15.280" style="s2">jordan aimed the conversation at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">dead center of these trends</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.280" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">i was first made aware of jordan and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">neurohacker collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:25.040" style="s2">at a podcast dinner and recording</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">for wim hof that chris ryan and i did</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.040" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">and some of his folks from the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">hector collective were brought along by</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:33.760" style="s2">some stanford researchers jordan was one</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">of the co-founders of divx</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">dabbled in just about anything you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.800" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2">imagine from philosophy to role-playing</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">with most of his interests coming back</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">to the co-evolution of human</p>

<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">jordan has come to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">humanity is in the midst</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">of a world historical transition and as</p>

<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to kill us all like mad max</p>

<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">maybe see us in a amazing future like</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">way too at the end of the show</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">maybe we can start with this i&#39;ve heard</p>

<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:44.959" style="s2">well actually it&#39;s funny there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.440" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">probably two ways of describing it one</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.959" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">is what i think is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">the reality is that a smart drug is a</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">separate people from their money um but</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.439" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">if we want to actually talk about uh the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.599" style="s2">the you know the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">honest category uh which i think has</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.599" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">been known as no tropics for a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">and then we have to decide what are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the best set of nominal glitch</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">because it&#39;s such an emergent thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not very well understood</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">um it is the the recognition of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">that neurochemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">is an actual real thing and that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">use a combination of neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">molecular biochemistry and pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">to design neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">interventions that change the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">the brain works and therefore change the</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">and your psychology work in desired</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.400" style="s2">so you know the old i guess it was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">60s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.400" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">phrase better living through chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">um plausibly actually delivered on</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">so as i understand it nootropics are a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">little bit more like hey how can i</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">upgrade my</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">brain is that right</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">yeah what i would i you know i tend to</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">come to things from the top</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">down and uh or the very very bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">um the idea of no tropics is to say can</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">we upgrade your conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">in general or more specifically can we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">actually upgrade your your adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">capacity your ability to be effective in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">um and then so below that intent</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">is the set of more concrete things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">make that possible it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.280" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">um your adaptation to the world is a</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">sometimes being more alert is good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">an</p>

<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">maladaptive so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s less about the ability to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:39.360" style="s2">on some specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">kind of local concrete upgrade and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.360" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">actually more about the ability to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">a sense of what is the total portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:52.240" style="s2">of capacities that make up a particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">state and then how do we actually try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.240" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">one upgrade your portfolio so you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">more ability to respond to the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">and then improve the the total set</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">so that your your total sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">responsive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">is more adaptive to the total set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">environmental conditions you might find</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">when i think back at this like you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">i guess the idea sprung in the 60s and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">remember being in college and going like</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">wow i</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">i really need to i don&#39;t know drink more</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">coffee</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">or take some stru you know some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">drugs or something to kind of get my</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">focus going here and a lot of it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">cultural right like i had school or i</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">some sort of pressure on me and i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">to increase my performance so</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">i guess just starting at the high level</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">here is the idea here that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">look our culture and our pressures have</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">increased beyond evolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">and sure mother nature gave us a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">brain but that brain doesn&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">our culture so we need to do something</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">in order to enhance performance to meet</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">the demands that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a fair way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">putting it um i i would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">i would actually put it into more of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">longer term narrative which is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">mother nature gave us a great brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">which has always been</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">and will always be in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">some kind of pharmacology you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:09.280" style="s2">whether it&#39;s just simply</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">are you consuming fats or carbohydrates</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.280" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">which is going to very significantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">change the way your brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">behaves um or you know are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">consuming</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:19.440" style="s2">coffee or chocolate which are different</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">chemistries that the brain has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.440" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">co-evolving with</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">since we&#39;ve had brains um and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">there&#39;s two movements one movement is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">continuous coevolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">the body brain system and the the set</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">of environmental factors that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">interact with</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">and then the second is that the that</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">co-evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">particularly in the middle of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">century began to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">quite radically accelerate outside of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">the what we call the equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">feedback or the safe space the safe zone</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">that evolution had prepared us for and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">we&#39;re now kind of an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">we bootstrapped ourselves well outside</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.440" style="s2">of what nature prepared us for</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re now increasingly having to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.440" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">rather deep responsibility for where</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve put ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">and so that&#39;s interesting so one way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">approaching that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">upgrade would be uh i guess using</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">some sort of chemical biology are there</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:25.840" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">premises around what we&#39;ll need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:33.200" style="s2">our brains beyond the chemical piece</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">sure absolutely um the scope is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.200" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">is holistic we have to actually take</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">into account the whole system so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:40.880" style="s2">you know whether you&#39;re talking about uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">breathing</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.880" end="00:08:45.200" style="s2">breathing is actually a very fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">attack the the jamie wheel who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.200" end="00:08:48.800" style="s2">friend of ours and a partner of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">project um talks about</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">all kinds of different ways the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">different very specific breathing like</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">you&#39;re breathing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">in through your nose and then holding</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">for a little while and then breathing</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">out sharply through your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">uh changes uh the presence of nitrous</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">oxide in your bloodstream</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s a physical act that changes</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">chemistry in a particular direction but</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">you also have things that change</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">you know different forms of breathing</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">will change um</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">brainwave states you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">tonality different making different</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">sounds like vibrating the the nasal</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">passages does something so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">you can think of it as an unrestricted</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">tool kit</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">of different ways that you can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">that modify physical reality that modify</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">the mind brain system that then modify</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">cognitive and psychological state right</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s just kind of a loop of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">and ideally what happens is that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">modify your cognitive and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">so as to have a better perception</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">of the possible ways to go back into</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">that loop</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">and better capacity to make decisions on</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">how to drive that loop so you actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">get a continuous</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">up gradient loop if that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">obviously you&#39;ve experimented a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">with this what is it first of all what</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">does it even</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">feel like what do people imagine</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">what should they imagine with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">to be on a nootropic to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">um i guess let&#39;s just use the word</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:21.920" style="s2">hacked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">cognitively so what is that what should</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:25.680" style="s2">they imagine in their heads what does it</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:28.160" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.680" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">okay well i&#39;ll start from the from this</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.160" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">from the notion of broad</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">and work my way in so again the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">includes all possible ways of modifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">the system uh so as to improve adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">performance which means it includes</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">everything from</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">increasing emotional resilience to</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">increasing empathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">to increasing creativity to increasing</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">divergent thinking to increasing focus</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:52.320" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:54.320" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.320" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">subsidiary elements each one of which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.320" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">in the broad category</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">so and they all feel very different</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">right so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">taking a neotropic which radically</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.240" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">increases your empathy</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">uh you know obviously you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">feel more connected to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">other people and have a better sense of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">their emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">whereas by contrast if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">nootropic that really quite radically</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">increases your let&#39;s say it increases</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">your focus</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">and motivation but actually decreases</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">your empathy uh then that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">different what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">you&#39;re the idea of parallax you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">familiar with that concept like</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">one eye and two eyes you actually get</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">well it depends on how much energy you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">want to put into it and how much you</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">i think that as far as i can tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m only four to six years old so</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">gigantic universe of stuff that i have</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">no experience with whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">but as far as i can tell um it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">possible to integrate these things into</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">your normal state</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">broadly so even the super intense stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">it is possible through</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">practices and through deliberate effort</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">to be able to make that part of your</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">base</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">your your normally accessible state um</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">but you know maybe you don&#39;t have 40</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">years to dedicate to focusing on making</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">that possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">and it&#39;s not that that that important to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">your adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">capacity to be in life to have it be</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">part of your base state and so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:25.519" style="s2">just reserve it as something that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">access through some kind of ally so in</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">this case perhaps it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">micro dosing and so you&#39;ll say it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">i&#39;m never going to spend the time and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:33.600" style="s2">energy to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">capable of getting into the micro dosing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.600" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">state through simple</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">uh force of will so what i&#39;ll do is i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">just keep that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">ready at hand to be able to use when i</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">need it and i&#39;ll only need it say 10</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">of the time that&#39;s a very valid approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">given how huge of a market this seems</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">like it would be why is there</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">like not that much research or</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">scientific</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">community just embracing this or do i do</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:14:59.760" style="s2">i have this wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">oh no you&#39;ve got it dead on i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.760" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of different reasons um</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">so let&#39;s see if we can piece pill some</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">of them apart</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">um one of them is that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">a meaningful backlash to the 60s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">know the the kids in the 60s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.760" style="s2">uh rushed into something big powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">important and new</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:23.440" style="s2">with frankly very little discipline or</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">discernment um</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.440" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">which created a lot of good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">assuming you like rock and roll and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:32.320" style="s2">and computers um and also create a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">of bad stuff and so you then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.320" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">have the counter counter culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">backlash and a lot of things associated</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">with the use of chemistry to modify</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">uh subjective experience they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">tarred with that brush</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">and i think we can actually point to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">empirical reality for this</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">the people who are the survivors of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">60s</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">quite disproportionately for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">opposed things like marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">legalization</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">or silicon microdosing frankly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">a legacy of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">that bygone era whereas the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:07.839" style="s2">millennials are</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">radically less uh concerned about those</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.839" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">prohibitions and they maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">millennials are unwise because they</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">haven&#39;t experienced it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">but in the event that particular uh kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">of generational bias exists</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">uh another one which is separate but</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">related and very important</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">is the notion that consciousness as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">as a concept um is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">is itself actually quite tainted in in</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:35.519" style="s2">and this is changing and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:37.920" style="s2">changing so quite rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.519" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">but certainly a decade ago uh you know</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">broadly categorized consciousness in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">and therefore a scientist who played</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">um and i guess the last is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">certainly my experience in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">that most of the scientific academy</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:28.160" style="s2">has lost a lot of the kind of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.160" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">to truth to characterize the major arc</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.720" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">of science from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">19th century to the middle maybe into</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">the late 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">and broadly speaking has become a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.280" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">more of an institution than an</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">instrument to use uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">carol quigley&#39;s term meaning people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">much more concerned with doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">than with doing the truth thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:57.280" style="s2">huh does that mean that cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">have less of a puritanical</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.280" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">influence on their research</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">might be further along for example i</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">know pure acetaminophen has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">studied in europe for a super long time</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">and used over there so what are the big</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:10.880" style="s2">cultural differences between us and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">europe</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.880" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">well i think the short answer is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not really the right guy to give you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">an answer to that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um what i do know is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s both a cultural and a called a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">distinction that is quite diverse so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">places like</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">brazil and russia have a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">actual research done in these categories</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:36.400" style="s2">and also the individuals in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">are less concerned about what the formal</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.400" end="00:19:41.200" style="s2">structures tell them to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">this is also true in a lot of the asian</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.200" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s really each one is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">unique</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">every discrete region even even europe</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">which is kind of covered under a single</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">eu</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">each european country has its own</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:57.280" style="s2">different cultural history</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:19:58.240" style="s2">and its own different uh regulatory or</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.280" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">institutional</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.240" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">perspective on these kinds of things it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">is highly heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">is part of it also like pharma here is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:09.039" style="s2">all about</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">curing things a lot of what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.039" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">framework we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">in this conversation is about enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">things i just wonder like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">if if pharma is looking at dementia</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:18.720" style="s2">right and they&#39;re like hey take this</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">pill</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.720" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to help with dementia with</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">alzheimer&#39;s or this or that</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.760" style="s2">they would not be approaching it with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.760" end="00:20:32.200" style="s2">that uses and kind of the nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.760" style="s2">uh look you know use all of these uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.200" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">performance-enhancing things they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.760" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">looking at somehow i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">sequestering the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">or the the the outputs of dementia like</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:43.360" style="s2">trying to kind of minimize them versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know change the overall</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.360" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">chemistry of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">well we&#39;ve got a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">factors that are applying simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">so let&#39;s kind of take them each</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">piece by piece and again i i have not</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">actually been</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">inside the pharma industry so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">articulating right now is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">more of a derivative of a model of how</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">industries in general work</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">and some amount of experience with</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">actual people inside big pharma so</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:08.960" style="s2">take this with a grain of salt but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">the basic idea is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.960" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">the primary driver of pharma is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re dealing with something which</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">an evolved industry</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">inside a a co-evolving regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">framework right this is just how</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">everything works</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">and so first and foremost pharma</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">is looking for things where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">size of the market and the return</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">justifies the rather extraordinary cost</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">neces</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">necessary for them to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">gates to be able to sell anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s actually quite important uh so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">you know if we could provide a solution</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:51.520" style="s2">to dementia that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.000" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">was effectively free pharma could not</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.520" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">pursue it um because they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">extract billions of dollars of revenue</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">for their products</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:03.679" style="s2">otherwise they can&#39;t justify the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">actually going to doing the research</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.679" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">and this is you know decisively</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:11.520" style="s2">the second element is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">because of the regulatory environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.520" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">and the way that the regulatory trials</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">are done</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">and frankly the current state of our um</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">epistemology of causation pharma is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">broadly limited to</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">relatively simple uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">causal mechanisms and i don&#39;t and when i</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">say relatively simple i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">the specific intervention right so they</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">one two or two molecule</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.559" style="s2">uh products that have that they can then</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">do all the work they do to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.559" end="00:22:45.200" style="s2">prove all the things they need to prove</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">to be able to get regulatory approval to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.200" end="00:22:47.280" style="s2">bring them to market</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">but what that means is that if a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.280" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">particular solution requires say four or</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">five distinct</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">interacting causal factors they just</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">can&#39;t even touch it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.000" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">gigantic universe of possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:01.440" style="s2">is not within the scope of what they can</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.440" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">um what was the other one that mattered</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:09.200" style="s2">oh and i guess it&#39;s also important to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">recognize and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.200" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">uh linked back to the first which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">that unfortunately it actually is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">case that in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">maintain the the business model</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:20.400" style="s2">curing things is actually not anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">near as lucrative as</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.400" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">uh maintaining uh maintaining health</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">through uh pharmaceutical engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:30.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">uh if farmer could make a a product that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">cure dementia that cost a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">thousand dollars or could make a product</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">that ameliorated the negative</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">consequences of dementia but you had to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">be on it forever</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">and therefore made 10 million dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re almost economically required</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">to go for the latter over the former</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">they may in fact be in breach of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">fiduciary due to shareholders if they do</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">the alternative</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">um so we&#39;ve got a lot of complexity both</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">in terms of the scientific approach</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">that we&#39;ve received over the past 100</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">years and what&#39;s worked what hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">the the physical economic cost of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">executing that scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">approach and then the regulatory and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">financial framework of what candy can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">be done</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of the whole the whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:15.440" style="s2">loop on that side and then you flip to</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">the other side which is</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.440" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">in the current environment we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">really just starting to get into it the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">the the advent of ubiquitous and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">relatively free information</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">things like you know biohackers being</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:30.799" style="s2">able to communicate broadly with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">biohackers past a critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.799" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">the quantified self movement and so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.480" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">ability to turn</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">quantifiable data into sensors or</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">feedback mechanisms that live</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">at the edge in extremely large numbers</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">is actually changing the landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">what we can do</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">um in a very important way like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:51.919" style="s2">this is it&#39;s not a trivial shift it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental shift in the nature</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">of how much</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">information of what kind and with what</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:24:59.039" style="s2">kind of fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.520" end="00:25:00.799" style="s2">we can actually generate and then of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">course you have computational resources</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:07.679" style="s2">and machine learning that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">really quite radically opens up new</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.679" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">potentials and being able to explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">in particular much more complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">causal frameworks than the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">legacy pharmaceutical methodologies</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">could explore</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">so is the toothpaste out of the tube in</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2">the same way</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">that i mean when you&#39;re talking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">reminding me a little bit of the way</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">that like the music industry was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:30.640" style="s2">disrupted right</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">through a number of things the internet</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">um how people publish it who has rights</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">music labels all that stuff like now is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:39.760" style="s2">people are scrambling trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">out how to control it because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">toothpaste went on the tube on it is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">that the way you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:48.559" style="s2">things headed for not just</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">nootropics but just overall as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.559" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:52.240" style="s2">even pharma i&#39;ll go broader than that i</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">think i would say that we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.240" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">there for everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">um and the fact that we&#39;re headed there</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">for everything is important for</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">everything because there&#39;s a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">loop</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">so the way i think about in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:06.080" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">is i very much use evolutionary models</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.080" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">um because there&#39;s you know if i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">a niche let&#39;s say for example i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">the ice age</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">when i&#39;ve got the ice age woolly</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">mammoths emerge and are successful</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">uh but when the ice age ends and we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">a warm period</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">welding amendments go away and it really</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the willie mammoth</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">what to do if the niche has changed the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:28.799" style="s2">niche has changed</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.799" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">conceptual framework for what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">broadly</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:37.440" style="s2">so the the the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">of exponential technology particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">in the domain of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">that began in the late 1970s and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:47.760" style="s2">continues to accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">are a very very fundamental change</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.760" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">in the niche and those institutional</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">music industry banking pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">medical it doesn&#39;t matter effectively</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">all institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">that evolved in the niche of scarce</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">information um are almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">always going to be quite significantly</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">unfit for the emergent niche</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">of abundant information</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">and then it&#39;s just a matter of time like</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">when certain industries like say</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">got hit quickly because their particular</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">kind of thing was very much</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">pure information and it wasn&#39;t that hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">for the information wave to touch that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">transform it to pure information just</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">suck all the energy out of that system</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">frankly music would have done exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">but for the fact that the music industry</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">actually connected deeper into the stack</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">to law and started using its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">influence the law to start</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">making it so that infra so the natural</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">movement of music into the information</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">wave</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:55.919" style="s2">couldn&#39;t happen and it got held back by</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.919" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">uh pressure in the case of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">and pharma you know we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">things that on the one hand are</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:10.240" style="s2">vastly more informationally complex</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">music this that right all of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">things become disintermediated</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.159" style="s2">is it governments that are like holy</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2"> we need to keep the control and we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.159" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">need to kind of step in here and try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">uh regulate and put boxes around this</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">to be honest i think so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">exactly the right way of describing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:10.900" style="s2">um i think we&#39;ve kind of we&#39;ve reached</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">that stage uh so first i think that the</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">on just uh like a level playing field</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">the the information wave we can also</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.039" style="s2">call it the decentralization wave it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">actually is the information wave but</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">decentralization happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">very tightly linked to abundant</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">information so the the information wave</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:33.600" style="s2">is already passing through most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">primary components of</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">there and it&#39;s pretty obvious that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">getting there to most people who care</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">about that kind of thing and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">uh as the energy of money and finance</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">starts getting sucked over into the</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">you&#39;ll see an accelerating breakdown of</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.600" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">institutional forum and that&#39;ll show up</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">as a kind of crisis and frankly i</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">even think like if you want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:20.960" style="s2">good understanding of why it is that our</p>

<p begin="00:31:20.960" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">seem to be going insane i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:28.080" style="s2">actually a big part of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">that there is a an actual crisis going</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.240" end="00:31:40.640" style="s2">uh in which the late 20th century</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.240" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">uh into crisis and i said earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of happening everywhere and</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">it&#39;s important and this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">a very deep point and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">grasp which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">social systems hang together you know</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">so you can go to college so you can</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">so you can get a job right if if jobs</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">if there was zero</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">upside to getting a college degree and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">getting a job that was de-linked</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">then the education system would have</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">changed long ago</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">but because they are linked and because</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">they hang together it actually creates a</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">is actually very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">you can&#39;t change education unless you</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">so that that set of feedback loops</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">if you kind of if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">it as a as like a field</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">you can imagine like a sheet of paper</p>

<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">kind of on the bottom left corner you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">have a a bunch of feedback loops and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:08.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a hard center look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">like a whirlpool and that&#39;s our 20th</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">attractor part of the new whirlpool and</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">as they do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">both the old whirlpool begins to lose</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">its energy because it&#39;s got less stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:37.519" style="s2">that&#39;s orbiting it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">less feedback moves to maintain its</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.519" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">integrity and the new one</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">begins to build its energy um</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s really really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.760" style="s2">because things like uh you know how does</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:49.760" style="s2">an individual human being</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.760" end="00:33:52.159" style="s2">behave and participate in the</p>

<p begin="00:33:52.159" end="00:33:55.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they behaved and</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:59.039" style="s2">participated in the centralized economy</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.360" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">now you have to have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.039" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">capacity loaded on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">each individual has has to have more</p>

<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">to be able to take more responsibility</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:11.919" style="s2">in the world one because their degrees</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.560" end="00:34:12.560" style="s2">of freedom are going to be wide open but</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.919" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.560" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">because the the boxes are not going to</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:19.440" style="s2">right you&#39;re not just going to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.839" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">get handed off from one machine to</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">with a very small amount of choices in</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be floating around in a</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">choose to say okay today i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">actually do learning</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to focus on education it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">what i&#39;m doing today oh well tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">i&#39;m to actually very specifically focus</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:37.599" style="s2">on self-care and level up my capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">engage in a better</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.599" end="00:34:41.119" style="s2">way of maintaining my well-being okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">well then for the next two hours i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.119" end="00:34:44.079" style="s2">actually going to be engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">what otherwise just to be known as work</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.079" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ll add my value to some set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">projects which are useful</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">and therefore provided more resources to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:51.280" style="s2">do the other stuff i want to do so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.280" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">really rather vastly different way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">and as more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">beginning to grasp that and take on</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">the leveling themselves up into a higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">higher degree of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">which also means a higher and higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">degree of empowerment then</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">they have less need for patients with</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">or connection to the legacy structures</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">of centralized authority</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">which breaks those legacy structures</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.680" style="s2">and capacity and begins the process of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">forming what do these new structures</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.680" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">look like as a collaboration between</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">empowered responsible individuals is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">conceivable to think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">then governments or the controlling</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.200" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">aspects of social structures that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">have the governing aspects to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">uh in the future a uh non-geographically</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">bound entity that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">that spans you know that we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">participate in and maybe move from thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">to things so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">i&#39;m part of a um governing system</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">that is not necessarily the united</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">states but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">some structure that i&#39;m a part of that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">associate with that i kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">and people can move from structure to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">structure or do you see all those things</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.359" style="s2">kind of coagulating into a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">one economy one system that we then kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.359" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">of move within</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">well i i kind of want to i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">important to make sure that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.079" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">um how do we do this right it will</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">definitely not look like</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:24.320" style="s2">one world government in a 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">sense right that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.320" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">uh there&#39;s very good reasons to to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s the case and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">probably the most important</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">is that the 20th century model of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">um doesn&#39;t have enough bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:40.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have enough capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">receive</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.880" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">and process information and make good</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">to deal with the actual complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s just structurally impossible</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like trying to uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s right for the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:58.400" style="s2">metaphor um</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:37:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to fly an airplane with</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.400" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">a calculator it&#39;s just not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.240" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">it done</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:05.119" style="s2">so what can get it done is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">better question</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.119" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">and the answer is much closer to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">mesh work that you described some</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">actually rather decentralized as</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">decentralized as</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">can be done mesh work of governance</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">units that have apis on how they relate</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">and some meaningful portion of it will</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">in fact still be</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:26.640" style="s2">geographic because we still have</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">physical bodies and there are still</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.640" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">major</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">questions of physicality like food and</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">water and physical safety</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:36.079" style="s2">but some major portion of it will also</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">be highly virtualized</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.079" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">um and there&#39;s actually a kind of a cool</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">term called subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">which is the principle of governance</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">should be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">into the lowest level where it can</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">actually be done</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">metaphor um</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:53.680" style="s2">yet at the same time there will actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">be a lot of things that will actually be</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.680" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">totally global</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">because it just happens to be the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">effective way to to manage them</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">and those will tend to be very</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">lightweight</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">but and very virtual but also global in</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">like say the internet there&#39;s no real</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">point in there being</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">two or three very very separate</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">internets there&#39;s a very high quality</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">attractor to have a highly decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">system which has simple protocols to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">enable information to flow seamlessly</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">being a single unified protocol jordan</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">you have to be on heavy nootropics right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">now because you&#39;re clearly way smarter</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">than i am</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">let me ask you a question how did you go</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">from like i used to be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">tech i guess i kind of still am uh and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:34.960" style="s2">then i moved out a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">have been doing different stuff and i</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">navigate this thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">came in and started talking to me about</p>

<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">was just he noted</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">that he was a little bit surprised that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">i was reading</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">such a thing and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a good um a good narrative</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:04.960" style="s2">that is much closer to the center who i</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">have always been</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.960" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">i did philosophy undergrad i also did</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">compsci</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">ai economics political science political</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">agriculture but always at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">stack because i was just most interested</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">in those things which the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">durable and either most fundamental or</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">most emergent um and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">from a personality perspective i just</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:29.760" style="s2">grew up as a nerd</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">i just happened to be the guy who liked</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.760" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">computers video games of all sorts role</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">playing games board games comic books</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">science fiction all that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">and so my my identity the who i am</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">was just very deeply connected with nerd</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">culture my</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">uh predilection was focusing on things</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:52.640" style="s2">that are either fundamental or emergent</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">and those two things in 1994</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">happened to overlap in doing things in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:58.480" style="s2">tech</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">and so that&#39;s how i got into tech by</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.480" end="00:41:01.920" style="s2">virtue of that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">in many ways it was always a means to an</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">end my objective has always been</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">focusing on where is this thing going</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:11.119" style="s2">and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:12.160" style="s2">do the best job as a whole in this giant</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">story of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.160" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">humanity in the universe and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:18.800" style="s2">subsidiarily how what role does</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:21.359" style="s2">technology play</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.800" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">broadly and then below that level what</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.359" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">role can i play in the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">technology in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">that bigger picture help everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">get super geeky too what kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">are you reading should they be reading</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">easy answer to that right now with</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">regard to neuro hacker which which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">jamie&#39;s book</p>

<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">a lot of the primary territory and he</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">probably covers it in a fashion which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.680" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">uh true and digestible</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s the kind of thing that it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">one of those things if you haven&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">it in the next year</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">people will be wondering what value</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve been up to</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:08.319" style="s2">um and you can think of that as caller</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">level up tech</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.319" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">the whole set of tech that&#39;s existed</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">since the greek</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">elissenian mysteries then although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">a contemporary environment on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">actually collectively go about</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">solving the problem of having enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.839" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">individual capacity to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2"> we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">okay so aside from that nerding out i</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">beyond that when i nerd out i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">nerd out big time um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">a pretty good comic book called</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:36.079" style="s2">unflattening</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">i actually think comic books are an</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.079" end="00:42:39.839" style="s2">excellent vehicle</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">for understanding stuff because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.839" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">have the ability to use</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">visual and text simultaneously which</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">actually are two very different</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">modalities of expression</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">and then flattening specifically plays</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">with that it gives you a better sense of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:55.760" style="s2">why it is i say what i just said</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:59.200" style="s2">if you want to go even deeper i would</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.760" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">take a look at the contemporary or the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.200" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">best current works on</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">uh the lineage from marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">do you remember him the medium is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:09.599" style="s2">message oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">you know his stuff was hot and then got</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.599" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">cold and but then</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">a whole bunch of people have held on to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">it and it&#39;s actually frankly fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">like the linkage between</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">psychology or neuropsychology how our</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">how our brain</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">forms our psychological experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">the relationship between that and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.640" style="s2">developmental environment of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.640" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">uh that mediates our relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">world you know the kind of tech that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">used particularly during our</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">first 20 years of life and what that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">implies</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">for how we make sense of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">how we act in the world is</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">actually fundamental like if you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">that you can make some really good</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:51.680" style="s2">predictions</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on next um</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.680" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">i think the next right now this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">actually quite interesting i believe</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">we&#39;re actually in a moment a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">significant acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:00.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult for people to write</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:02.319" style="s2">books</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:42.000" style="s2">turns out to be very very important</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.040" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">um but what i&#39;m actually seeing right</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.000" end="00:44:46.240" style="s2">now is it&#39;s more of a list of the people</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.240" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">have made have already done enough work</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.480" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">what&#39;s true um and away from and to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">what&#39;s important um honestly what i</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">would do is exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">rather than sort of think of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">that should be i&#39;d actually think of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">things that shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">um my primary recommendation to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">is turn almost everything off</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">most forms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.280" style="s2">information curation most of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">techniques particularly everything that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.280" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">is commercial</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">at any scale and definitely anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:35.560" style="s2">that&#39;s commercial any scale that existed</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:39.440" style="s2">before to call it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.560" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">2010 is bad for you</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.440" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">um it&#39;s not going to be working in your</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">best interest and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">optimized to make it hard for you to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">make sense yourself like it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:51.040" style="s2">jacking your olympic system</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:52.560" style="s2">so broadly speaking turn off your tv</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.040" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">almost entirely</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">don&#39;t read newspapers and be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.839" style="s2">careful like don&#39;t participate</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:01.599" style="s2">in facebook or most of the twitterverse</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.839" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.599" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">learnings that we had in nutrition</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">about the kinds of fats you take in</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">that level of nutritional discernment</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">has to be applied to your informational</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">diet</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">at least at that level and probably even</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">higher um</p>
