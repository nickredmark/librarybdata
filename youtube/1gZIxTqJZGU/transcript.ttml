<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">so many things go into making who we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">and how we show up right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">and then return to the air passing</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">through your body</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">let your breathing remind you that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:15.600" style="s2">are in exchange</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">with the atmosphere of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">with all of life</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.960" end="00:05:29.120" style="s2">puppies the trees</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">and with each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">still have that image that we&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">or holding hands inside of each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.479" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">and let yourself relax into this</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">exchange</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">our breathing is a testament to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">that life</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">requires that we stay in exchange if we</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">try to stop that exchange would die</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">have to keep breathing</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">staying in the exchange</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">it takes more energy to hold up our</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">boundaries anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to make the exchange</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s already happening it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">we&#39;re just focusing on it and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">conscious of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">very good i think we&#39;re all here now</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">so in less than 12 hours i will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">sitting on the bank of a lake</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">with a great blue heron as i do most</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">mornings</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:04.479" style="s2">he sits on a branch that&#39;s fallen into</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">the water</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.479" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">and it sticks out of the water and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">there every day</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">and i sit about 20 feet away from him</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">he watches for the fish and i watch him</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">it&#39;s the most amazing thing when he</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">catches a fish his whole body plunges</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">into the water</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">he comes back up in this he has this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:32.160" style="s2">fish in his mouth that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">seems way too big to fit down his throat</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.160" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">and i can actually see the fishtail like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">flopping</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">in his throat and the outline of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">fish</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">as it just kind of goes down slowly</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">then he does this amazing thing he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">holding on to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">branch with his feet and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">with the the fish stuck in his throat</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:58.879" style="s2">he turns his whole body upside down and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">he dips his beak into the water to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.879" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">to grab some water and then and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fall over</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.599" style="s2">and he comes back up and he and he takes</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">a drink and then slowly the fish goes</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.599" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">this whole process takes about five</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">minutes or so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">very familiar with it he&#39;s my morning</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">friend</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">and then he um he wipes his beak off</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">on against the side of the branch</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">then he flies away</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">this morning when i was out there there</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">was this nice</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">breeze it was making these ripples</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.159" end="00:08:44.399" style="s2">across the top of the water</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">and i remembered something a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.399" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">told me years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.200" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">he said that there&#39;s a holy wind that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">blows through you</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:57.200" style="s2">and i used to think that that was god</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.279" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure what to call it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">i know that even though you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.920" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">not the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">that that same holy wind that blows</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">through me</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">blows through you</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">what moves through me moves through you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">on some level we&#39;re interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">and interdependent and for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">what these intersubjective practices are</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">and i know that i know that that wind</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">travels through both through all of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">and i wonder how i know that</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.920" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">there&#39;s so many things that i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">and so many things that i can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">in our world but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">i know</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">and i know that the way that we are with</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">each other matters</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.040" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">as if the wind feels it too the way we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">interact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">these inner subjective practices can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">that simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">you and me and the wind that blows</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.360" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">through us</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">um rebel wisdom recently released a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:31.680" style="s2">video called</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">the evolving conversation with john</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.680" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">varvakey and peter limberg</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">you may have seen that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s one one part in there um john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">john&#39;s talking about he&#39;s doing this</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">project and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">um i will butcher this peter but um</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:54.560" style="s2">he&#39;s doing this project where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">blending socratic dialogue with circling</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.560" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">in the exploration of wisdom something</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">and in this video john proposes</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">that rather than being motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:08.399" style="s2">curiosity in our inner subjective</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.399" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">that we should invoke wonder we should</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">be invoking wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">and he says that wonder is where you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">opening to the space</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">where you&#39;re confronting mystery being</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">in the unknown together</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">he says you&#39;re calling out into question</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:32.640" style="s2">and your world so that they both can</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">undergo a restructuring of identity</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.640" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">he says wonder can deepen into awe</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">which has the powerful ability to pull</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">people beyond their egocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to try out john&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">proposal today</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">so we&#39;re not going to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:50.800" style="s2">dialogues around wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to see if we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.800" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">participate and wonder together</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">and actually go into the wonder</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">knowing of wonder as as he says where</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">where you you know something by becoming</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">it and interacting with it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">so as we sit together in all of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:11.440" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">i want you to include your in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.440" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">the deepest uh most sacred</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">part of yourself that you can locate</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:23.839" style="s2">it has nothing to do with the roles that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">you play in life</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.839" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">and it has nothing to do with your to-do</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">list</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">or your future accomplishments your</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">plans for conquest</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">but it is it&#39;s that greater depth</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">that seems to go on forever like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">wind</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">you can&#39;t hold on to it you can only be</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">in the movement of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">hopefully this invokes a sense of wonder</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">about who we even are</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">and what happens when two people turn</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">toward each other and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:10.240" style="s2">open from this deepest place</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like the mystery that you are even</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">so if you have your eyes closed you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">go ahead and open them</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">see if you can make eye contact with a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">few of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">history to mystery</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">sacred to sacred</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.160" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">and as two fragrances can occupy the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">same space</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">we say there&#39;s room in me for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">these practices can be very intimate</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.160" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">so in our breakout rooms we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">let wonder lead</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:06.800" style="s2">i think we&#39;re going to do this in two</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">sections</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.800" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">so our first breakout will have a moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">of silence</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">with your partner just be with each</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">however you experience the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:20.000" style="s2">interconnectedness and the flow between</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">you and just sort of settle into each</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.000" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">other in that exchange</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:26.880" style="s2">and then after one minute i&#39;ll send a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:29.920" style="s2">broadcast and it says now the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.880" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">first person speaks and one person is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.920" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">going to explore for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:37.519" style="s2">beginning with i wonder so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to speak</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.519" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">begin your sentences or your questions</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">with i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">and then the second person will go</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">see if you can listen inside of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">wonder of your partner</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">you&#39;re listening and then we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">come back here to the main room</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see how that was and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">we&#39;ll go back out for another section</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">another part and i think we&#39;re good on</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">timing</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">okay so peter and my host</p>
