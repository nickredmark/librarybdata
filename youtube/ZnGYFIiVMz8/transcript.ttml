<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:06.779" style="s2">all right I figured out how to use an</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.449" end="00:00:08.820" style="s2">online whiteboard somewhat so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.779" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">to walk you through the Netflix of apps</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.820" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">with actual audio hopefully so I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:21.900" style="s2">want to explain how Netflix works just</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:24.990" style="s2">in case you didn&#39;t know but more</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:27.539" style="s2">importantly how to gather tech works</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.990" end="00:00:31.410" style="s2">similarly and yet completely magically</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.539" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">different I&#39;m done right needs more than</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.410" end="00:00:37.110" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">okay so Netflix works like this users</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.110" end="00:00:44.969" style="s2">pay approximately $10 per month per</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">account and personally and for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.969" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">money the user gets infinite access to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:57.770" style="s2">their catalogue of films cat thumbs all</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">the cat films even one catalog of films</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.770" end="00:01:08.159" style="s2">we are the Netflix of apps so for $10</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:20.210" style="s2">per member is where a co-op they get</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.159" end="00:01:25.939" style="s2">unlimited access to our catalog apps now</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.210" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">Netflix has their licensed content and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.939" end="00:01:38.579" style="s2">they have original content so this would</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">be things like Disney Star Wars original</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.579" end="00:01:46.009" style="s2">content would be like sensei and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:48.689" style="s2">stranger things</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.009" end="00:01:50.220" style="s2">they started out just licensing content</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.689" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">but they had so much money from their</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:54.899" style="s2">for profit from people paying $10 a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">month that they for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.899" end="00:01:59.600" style="s2">profit decided to put body into new</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:02.490" style="s2">projects that they thought their</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.600" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">membership would like and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.490" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">have been successes and some of them not</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">so much but that is their two options we</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">also can license content or create</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:18.329" style="s2">original so let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">license Yelp to work with our other apps</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.329" end="00:02:29.939" style="s2">and I some food network app that we like</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:34.079" style="s2">we can also create our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.939" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">so the idea Cafe would be one that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.079" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">would create which is what I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:46.079" style="s2">on currently on its own YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">we could create a childcare app one big</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.079" end="00:02:53.250" style="s2">huge difference is that Netflix if</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">Disney decides they&#39;re gonna create</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.250" end="00:02:57.919" style="s2">their own streaming video which they</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">have decided and no longer want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.919" end="00:03:05.189" style="s2">license to Netflix Netflix is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">allowed to just move licensed over to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.189" end="00:03:12.629" style="s2">original content they could recreate</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:14.909" style="s2">generic ice princess but nobody is going</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.629" end="00:03:17.790" style="s2">to watch it they cannot just move</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.909" end="00:03:20.790" style="s2">licensed content to original we however</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.790" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">if Yelp is too expensive can just</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.790" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">recreate a restaurant slash service</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">rating system if the food network is too</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:33.959" style="s2">expensive for us to license we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:35.639" style="s2">recreate our own food program so we in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.959" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">fact the point is to eventually have</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.639" end="00:03:40.349" style="s2">almost all original content and less</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:43.190" style="s2">license the content is so amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.349" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">created for purpose instead of profit</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.190" end="00:03:52.159" style="s2">also Netflix once sense8 is there once</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">stranger things or even frozen is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.159" end="00:03:56.939" style="s2">released it is released in its final</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:03:59.069" style="s2">format they don&#39;t go back and change it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.939" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">because they notice there&#39;s an error we</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.069" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">however because of how apps work can</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:06.299" style="s2">create something and keep it continually</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">improving it and making it better and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.299" end="00:04:10.979" style="s2">better and better I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:13.259" style="s2">graphic could showcase that but like you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.979" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">get what you get here it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.259" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">released as its final star product</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a star everyone whereas ours can</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">get infinitely better continually by</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:26.390" style="s2">increasing it their decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:32.660" style="s2">are all made because they&#39;re a company</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.390" end="00:04:34.730" style="s2">for profit because we are owned and run</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.660" end="00:04:37.100" style="s2">by our members who the reason they are</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.730" end="00:04:39.140" style="s2">there is so they can use the apps the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.100" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2">apps are created not for profit not for</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.140" end="00:04:42.890" style="s2">how much money we can make off of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:44.750" style="s2">but once we break even once it makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.890" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">sense the threshold is met we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.750" end="00:04:49.010" style="s2">creating for purpose the purpose of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:52.430" style="s2">childcare app is to create better</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.010" end="00:04:59.420" style="s2">childcare not to make more money but</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.430" end="00:05:01.400" style="s2">just like Netflix and no one&#39;s forced to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.420" end="00:05:02.810" style="s2">come on board and use Netflix right the</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.350" end="00:05:17.720" style="s2">is if we create better apps</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.100" end="00:05:19.070" style="s2">then what is out there for free if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.720" end="00:05:22.040" style="s2">create better apps than when it&#39;s out</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.760" end="00:06:18.290" style="s2">infinite catalog however we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.610" end="00:06:20.780" style="s2">just create we&#39;re not going to create</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.290" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">new life-changing apps every month but</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.780" end="00:06:24.680" style="s2">once we have the foundation of the ones</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">we need we can improve them but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.680" end="00:06:27.830" style="s2">need to keep recreating them unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:29.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a need for it unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.830" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">there is something we miss something</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.570" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">else that we need to create but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:37.410" style="s2">not we also not every app is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">used by every member</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.410" end="00:06:40.950" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have something for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:43.860" style="s2">but not every app is gonna be for</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.950" end="00:06:45.630" style="s2">everyone just like Netflix doesn&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.860" end="00:06:48.150" style="s2">about is everybody gonna launch says</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.630" end="00:06:50.460" style="s2">sensei they want enough people to watch</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.150" end="00:06:52.440" style="s2">it that it breaks even we are not even</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.460" end="00:06:55.530" style="s2">creating it they have to create with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.440" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">an idea of what their user wants but</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.530" end="00:06:58.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll be really hard for them to pull</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:06:59.970" style="s2">their audience and be like who would</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.350" end="00:07:01.350" style="s2">watch sense they&#39;d try explaining that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:02.670" style="s2">to people so there&#39;s 80 people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.350" end="00:07:03.960" style="s2">born at the same time and they all can</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.670" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">like go in each other&#39;s mind you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.960" end="00:07:08.310" style="s2">well if it&#39;s good I&#39;ll watch it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:10.590" style="s2">basically all so does everyone want a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.310" end="00:07:11.910" style="s2">food out well yes if it&#39;s good if I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.590" end="00:07:13.980" style="s2">use it if it&#39;s user friendly and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.910" end="00:07:17.400" style="s2">beautiful and functions absolutely I</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.980" end="00:07:21.980" style="s2">want it and so together we can create</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.400" end="00:07:25.260" style="s2">apps that don&#39;t just impact our own life</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.980" end="00:07:27.390" style="s2">also impact the system we can understand</p>
