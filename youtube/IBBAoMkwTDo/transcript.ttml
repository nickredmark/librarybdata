<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.279" style="s2">right hello welcome to Wednesday&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.380" end="00:00:08.010" style="s2">possibility in the pandemic where we do</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.279" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">solution raising this week is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.010" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">solution how they all interconnect</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:13.710" style="s2">together and next week where you are</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:15.630" style="s2">talking in energy specifically</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.710" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">ironically because this is also we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.630" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">going to be breaking up energy a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:21.680" style="s2">today because we both watched the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">documentary that Michael Moore is behind</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.680" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">what is it called planet humans energy</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">and how it&#39;s not so green and I did a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">video last week of almost a week ago on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">it and Eric here just watched it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">posted so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be coming up</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:42.090" style="s2">during our conversation but we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">to discuss what it&#39;s currently what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.090" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">the meta solution ie there is no better</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:48.690" style="s2">solution currently look like what could</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">it look like and what is the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.690" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">possible that we could do at ten</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:01:00.449" style="s2">dollars and would you like to start Eric</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">about what kickoff with because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.449" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">mentioned a couple of times in previous</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:06.360" style="s2">ones that I think sometimes the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">important question rather than looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.360" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">for solutions that there are already</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">solutions and what are the blockages to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">those solutions being implemented right</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">and and and so I think that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">which which leads nicely into as you</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:19.710" style="s2">just mentioned that might a bit we keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">referring to it as a Michael Moore</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.710" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">documentary it&#39;s not a Michael Moore</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">documentary he executive produced that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">he actually had very little to do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">the making of it other than other than</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:32.189" style="s2">funding it and putting his name behind</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">it so but yeah anyway they for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.189" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t seen this film planet of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">humans base the story it basically tells</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:42.299" style="s2">is that the green movement the drive to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">create renewable energy sources has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.299" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">captured by the market and is now just a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:51.560" style="s2">vehicle for capital to root to make more</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:54.930" style="s2">capital and that many of the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.560" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">particularly biomass and ethanol</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.930" end="00:02:00.899" style="s2">are completely counterproductive right</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">they require the use of fossil fuels in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.899" end="00:02:04.140" style="s2">a quantities greater than the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:05.430" style="s2">energy that comes out at the other end</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.140" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">of the process in the first place right</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.430" end="00:02:10.860" style="s2">so it&#39;s absolutely insane and it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">done purely for the reason of directing</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.860" end="00:02:13.600" style="s2">government grants into the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.600" end="00:02:18.010" style="s2">that literally is it is as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:19.750" style="s2">that and I know this sounds kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.010" end="00:02:20.530" style="s2">conspiracy theory kind of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.750" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of I mean I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.530" end="00:02:23.650" style="s2">posted about it on Facebook and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">been a lot of pushback people quoting</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.650" end="00:02:28.210" style="s2">Guardian articles to me and then when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:30.130" style="s2">look and this is this is really the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.210" end="00:02:31.630" style="s2">point of the whole story right when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.130" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">look at the Guardian article that</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.630" end="00:02:34.690" style="s2">someone put up as a rebuttal yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:37.630" style="s2">film is based on this information bla</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.690" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">bla bla bla bla it refers to according</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.630" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">to research recently undertaken it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:45.130" style="s2">now the case that the total amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:46.150" style="s2">energy put in is less than the total</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.130" end="00:02:47.710" style="s2">amount of energy yet right in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.150" end="00:02:50.650" style="s2">words things like electric cars and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.710" end="00:02:52.540" style="s2">and so on are actually energy efficient</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.650" end="00:02:54.340" style="s2">in that context but then when you click</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.540" end="00:02:55.720" style="s2">on what the research is and who&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.340" end="00:02:57.610" style="s2">it and who&#39;s funded the people that did</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.720" end="00:02:59.650" style="s2">the research it&#39;s all very very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.610" end="00:03:02.200" style="s2">very spurious and this is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.650" end="00:03:05.020" style="s2">point of the film is that the market has</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.200" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">captured the entire process including</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.020" end="00:03:09.250" style="s2">the process of evaluation and research</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:13.000" style="s2">and commentary on the thing afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.250" end="00:03:15.460" style="s2">right and so the the meta solution is</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.000" end="00:03:18.610" style="s2">for people to wake up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.460" end="00:03:21.730" style="s2">realize that the entire thing is in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.610" end="00:03:24.460" style="s2">state of capture and that you absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.730" end="00:03:25.870" style="s2">cannot trust governments and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.460" end="00:03:27.520" style="s2">corporations and the existing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.870" end="00:03:29.170" style="s2">institutions to come up with these</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.520" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">solutions let alone the meta solutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.170" end="00:03:33.100" style="s2">to these problems because they have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:34.630" style="s2">completely captured often without their</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.100" end="00:03:36.550" style="s2">knowledge I mean I&#39;m not saying that all</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.630" end="00:03:38.200" style="s2">of these people are evil and in on it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">right they&#39;re they&#39;re very very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.200" end="00:03:41.560" style="s2">clever there&#39;s a lot of deception goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:44.110" style="s2">on there&#39;s a lot of misinformation goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.560" end="00:03:45.460" style="s2">on they&#39;ve even got activist groups</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.110" end="00:03:47.710" style="s2">behind them right throwing their weight</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.460" end="00:03:49.810" style="s2">behind these solutions yeah oh yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.710" end="00:03:51.370" style="s2">is great this is green but but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.810" end="00:03:53.020" style="s2">not you know they&#39;ve been duped they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.370" end="00:03:54.370" style="s2">been fooled and because the activists</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.020" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">are saying is good everyone else thinks</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.370" end="00:03:58.360" style="s2">is good they quoted another thing in</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">there that 91% of plastic that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.360" end="00:04:01.900" style="s2">supposedly recycled is not recycled this</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:03.130" style="s2">is it&#39;s just dumped now I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.900" end="00:04:05.020" style="s2">whether that&#39;s true or not that was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.130" end="00:04:06.340" style="s2">figure they quoted I mean it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.020" end="00:04:08.260" style="s2">precise figure so I&#39;m assuming they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.340" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2">got some data from somewhere as I say I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.260" end="00:04:11.950" style="s2">cannot speak to the to the truth of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.420" end="00:04:16.540" style="s2">number but it&#39;s but it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.950" end="00:04:18.670" style="s2">example of the deception right to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.540" end="00:04:21.250" style="s2">seen to be Green is far far more</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.670" end="00:04:24.070" style="s2">important than actually being green and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.250" end="00:04:26.860" style="s2">and and that is a sickness that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.070" end="00:04:27.490" style="s2">pervades our entire culture and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.860" end="00:04:29.949" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.490" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">has to involve and I know Jubilees way</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.949" end="00:04:33.819" style="s2">onboard with this has to involve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:36.310" style="s2">transparency at every level right people</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.819" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">just open about as best they know it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.310" end="00:04:39.639" style="s2">truth of the situation not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:41.020" style="s2">cover things up not trying to hide them</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.639" end="00:04:43.180" style="s2">to make more profits not trying to hide</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.020" end="00:04:44.919" style="s2">them to avoid prosecution by some</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.180" end="00:04:47.110" style="s2">legislative body or whatever it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.919" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">but actual open transparency where</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.110" end="00:04:51.370" style="s2">everyone can see the books everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:53.770" style="s2">see the research there&#39;s no hiding I</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.370" end="00:04:56.139" style="s2">mean god this International Panel on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.770" end="00:04:57.190" style="s2">clean transportation that&#39;s who funded</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.139" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">this research right</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.190" end="00:05:00.430" style="s2">sounds like an official body right</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:02.289" style="s2">sounds like a reputable official body</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.430" end="00:05:04.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s a private institution</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.289" end="00:05:06.310" style="s2">funded by private individuals for their</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.750" end="00:05:10.389" style="s2">own ends do you know anything the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.310" end="00:05:11.740" style="s2">thing is a giant con and so yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.389" end="00:05:13.449" style="s2">sell I&#39;m really angry I just saw this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.740" end="00:05:15.880" style="s2">film yesterday and its really got my</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.449" end="00:05:20.349" style="s2">hackles up because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.880" end="00:05:22.389" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the taking of genuine good</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.349" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">intentions on the part of people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.389" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">turning them into and that is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:30.699" style="s2">is just evil at it so I can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:33.070" style="s2">anything worse than that right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.699" end="00:05:34.599" style="s2">that&#39;s my rant over for now awesome</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.070" end="00:05:37.060" style="s2">thanks Eric Shila do you want to share</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.060" end="00:05:41.199" style="s2">meta solutions currently looks like what</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.190" end="00:05:42.729" style="s2">we&#39;re currently doing how everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.199" end="00:05:44.830" style="s2">intertwines with everything else if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.729" end="00:05:49.659" style="s2">solve one one breaks and you know a meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.830" end="00:05:52.389" style="s2">the meta thing I&#39;m just gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.659" end="00:05:54.550" style="s2">wait and kind of chime in afterwards I</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.389" end="00:05:56.979" style="s2">totally agree with what Eric&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.550" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">and I just totally I think we need a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.979" end="00:06:01.870" style="s2">whole new counterbalancing system to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:02.289" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re asking all right</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.870" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.289" end="00:06:08.740" style="s2">I will I will share my rent all right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">yeah I look at our current gaming world</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.740" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">and I picture the Weasley house from</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:17.560" style="s2">Harry Potter like that it&#39;s held up with</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:19.930" style="s2">magic and hope and sometimes that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.560" end="00:06:22.060" style="s2">hope and sometimes it&#39;s bad hope and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.930" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like a business comes up and solves</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.060" end="00:06:25.090" style="s2">a problem but when they&#39;re solving that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:26.650" style="s2">problem they create all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.090" end="00:06:30.030" style="s2">externalities that it then it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.650" end="00:06:32.530" style="s2">somebody else to solve and in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.030" end="00:06:34.630" style="s2">transparency is the fix which we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.530" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">about the next part but it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.630" end="00:06:39.159" style="s2">big piece is information and so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.870" style="s2">have the information that is what a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.159" end="00:06:43.570" style="s2">of people commented what I commented on</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.870" end="00:06:45.400" style="s2">this final human last week on my channel</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.570" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">feel like although it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.400" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">right to the right numbers and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:51.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem with the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:53.590" style="s2">I love documentaries but there I feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.550" end="00:06:54.490" style="s2">like they&#39;re an outdated technology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.590" end="00:06:57.190" style="s2">then as soon as they&#39;re done they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.490" end="00:06:58.990" style="s2">done that informations based on ten</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.190" end="00:07:01.090" style="s2">years ago because they want it they want</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.990" end="00:07:02.860" style="s2">that to be a profitable project right</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.090" end="00:07:04.390" style="s2">the documentary itself they need to sell</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.860" end="00:07:07.510" style="s2">to you so it has to be sensationalized</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.390" end="00:07:09.130" style="s2">and what I want is the information I</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.510" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">want the data I want to actually know</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.130" end="00:07:12.970" style="s2">what goes into the solar panel if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:14.820" style="s2">have a solar panel company you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.970" end="00:07:17.950" style="s2">to sell solar panels so you can only</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.820" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">look at from the point we make them so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.950" end="00:07:20.320" style="s2">that I can sell them to use they make</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:21.850" style="s2">you energy and it doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.320" end="00:07:23.950" style="s2">information of what&#39;s going into that</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.850" end="00:07:26.110" style="s2">solar panel how much water how much</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.950" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">energy how much of the mining you got</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.110" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">like of the materials that we needed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">make this and so currently everything is</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:38.770" style="s2">interconnected you have people living in</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.430" end="00:07:40.810" style="s2">desperate poverty both the people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.770" end="00:07:42.640" style="s2">put them in art the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.810" end="00:07:44.140" style="s2">collected and amassed the wealth are</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.640" end="00:07:45.580" style="s2">responsible for that poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.140" end="00:07:46.870" style="s2">environmental degradation that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.580" end="00:07:48.880" style="s2">whatever you know they&#39;re passing off</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.870" end="00:07:50.950" style="s2">their externalities but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.880" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">lot of environmental cost that comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.950" end="00:07:57.670" style="s2">from being poor people mining people</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:59.890" style="s2">doing poaching and things that like we</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.670" end="00:08:01.720" style="s2">don&#39;t look at as rational choices but</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.890" end="00:08:03.610" style="s2">when you&#39;re starving they are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.720" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">rational choices and then you see you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.610" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">have like the people at the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:11.020" style="s2">the socio-economic costing a lot to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:12.850" style="s2">planet and the people at the top and one</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.020" end="00:08:15.160" style="s2">of those people has power one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.850" end="00:08:16.780" style="s2">people has a choice but do they with all</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.160" end="00:08:17.980" style="s2">of their money and amass power comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.780" end="00:08:22.630" style="s2">from the bottom and the misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.980" end="00:08:24.610" style="s2">the lack of transparency so it is all</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.630" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">interconnected but in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.610" end="00:08:28.450" style="s2">like you pull one brick out and it might</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">all collapse we also can build the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.450" end="00:08:31.780" style="s2">scaffold and it makes it stronger and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:34.810" style="s2">can look at ways because when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.780" end="00:08:36.280" style="s2">because if you solve one thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.810" end="00:08:39.130" style="s2">causes all of this havoc and you pass</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.280" end="00:08:40.810" style="s2">off those externalities there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.130" end="00:08:43.000" style="s2">positive externality side right if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.810" end="00:08:45.010" style="s2">solve education in any way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:47.410" style="s2">helping everyone if you solve poverty in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">any way you&#39;re helping everyone and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.410" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">it can unstow ball the same as it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.740" style="s2">snowball in the same direction it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.790" end="00:08:54.100" style="s2">about the transparency and having that</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.740" end="00:08:56.620" style="s2">Khan</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.100" end="00:08:58.329" style="s2">feedback loop in the information and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.620" end="00:08:59.889" style="s2">getting off-topic because I&#39;m now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.329" end="00:09:02.259" style="s2">talking about like the possibility but</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.889" end="00:09:05.410" style="s2">it&#39;s right now like honestly we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.259" end="00:09:07.149" style="s2">create a system that isn&#39;t documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.410" end="00:09:12.399" style="s2">like documentaries is still this like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.149" end="00:09:14.500" style="s2">news feed system instead of a dashboard</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.399" end="00:09:16.389" style="s2">of like wait where are we with</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.500" end="00:09:18.579" style="s2">alternative energy what does that</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.389" end="00:09:21.490" style="s2">currently look like not so Michael Moore</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.579" end="00:09:22.990" style="s2">Jeff Gibbs can sell a film and not so BP</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.490" end="00:09:24.220" style="s2">can look like they&#39;re being green and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.990" end="00:09:26.440" style="s2">not so our governments can look like</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.220" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">they&#39;re being green what currently is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.440" end="00:09:30.220" style="s2">actually the best solution what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">best solar panel we have and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.220" end="00:09:33.940" style="s2">improve it what&#39;s what makes it the best</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:35.470" style="s2">because there probably isn&#39;t one best</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.940" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">one probably uses at least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.470" end="00:09:39.399" style="s2">water or one probably uses the least</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:42.009" style="s2">amount of coal probably and so looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.399" end="00:09:44.920" style="s2">at what is the data what is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.009" end="00:09:48.009" style="s2">information and yes just that picture of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.920" end="00:09:51.069" style="s2">the Weasley house it&#39;s like kept up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.009" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">like band-aids and magic and you pull</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.069" end="00:09:55.269" style="s2">one thing out and it collapses and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:09:57.399" style="s2">the world is waking up right now to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.269" end="00:09:58.990" style="s2">fact that we don&#39;t have magic and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.399" end="00:10:00.610" style="s2">live in this Weasley house it is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.990" end="00:10:06.370" style="s2">any kind of quake and it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.610" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">collapse and that is that is my I like</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.370" end="00:10:10.509" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we are right now is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:13.769" style="s2">the house of tiles held up by magic hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.509" end="00:10:13.769" style="s2">that&#39;s really nice that&#39;s really ugly</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.130" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s that there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.360" end="00:10:22.029" style="s2">occurred to me while you were speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:26.380" style="s2">there do believe that this need for</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.029" end="00:10:30.209" style="s2">transparency it&#39;s it&#39;s such a long way</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.380" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">off right that that mindset that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.209" end="00:10:34.899" style="s2">produces transparency because you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.639" style="s2">it&#39;s in everyone&#39;s long-term best</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.899" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">interests right even if you up</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.639" end="00:10:40.839" style="s2">here being honest about that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:43.449" style="s2">up is actually good for everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.839" end="00:10:45.220" style="s2">and you know the understanding that this</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.449" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">fuckup happened and why it happened and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.220" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">so this is this is good right and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:55.930" style="s2">creating an environment in which people</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:10:58.509" style="s2">can be transparent without fear of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.930" end="00:11:00.699" style="s2">retribution right because this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.509" end="00:11:03.699" style="s2">the great barriers to transparency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.699" end="00:11:05.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about people wanting to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.699" end="00:11:08.259" style="s2">secretive right that&#39;s that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.559" end="00:11:10.689" style="s2">issue the issue is is is people unable</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.259" end="00:11:12.489" style="s2">to be forthcoming and transparent for</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.689" end="00:11:14.679" style="s2">fear of some kind of consequence whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.489" end="00:11:16.540" style="s2">real or imagined right but fear a bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.679" end="00:11:18.579" style="s2">but fear of some kind of consequence so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.540" end="00:11:23.350" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re gonna drill right</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.579" end="00:11:25.929" style="s2">down into the meta the meta is creating</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.350" end="00:11:29.379" style="s2">that environment of security and safety</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.929" end="00:11:31.209" style="s2">and lack of lack of pointing fingers and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.379" end="00:11:33.669" style="s2">looking to blame people for you</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.209" end="00:11:36.699" style="s2">know what I mean and and and yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.669" end="00:11:38.709" style="s2">how the hell do you do that in a world</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.699" end="00:11:40.239" style="s2">where as you say people are starving and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.709" end="00:11:41.619" style="s2">struggling to get by and don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:08.600" style="s2">post something and I looked at it and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.480" end="00:14:09.890" style="s2">was like the tablet table of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:11.570" style="s2">or something like that and I was looking</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.070" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">why one person doing it a tiny group of</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.550" end="00:15:17.990" style="s2">really royally up right like I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.990" end="00:15:22.400" style="s2">community but other than that like</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:24.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the bar anything shy of that I</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.340" end="00:15:40.970" style="s2">idea even if I create a solar panel and</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.350" end="00:15:41.660" style="s2">there is something fundamentally wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.970" end="00:15:44.090" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.660" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">even if the company goes bankrupt I</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.200" end="00:15:52.670" style="s2">take more risk and the shame part which</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.810" end="00:15:54.830" style="s2">we have to like I can&#39;t solve that for</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.670" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">7.5 billion people but I can solve it</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.830" end="00:15:58.670" style="s2">for me by finding people who will</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:00.590" style="s2">support me even if I make mistakes right</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.670" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.590" end="00:16:04.820" style="s2">something there and now unless China</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:06.200" style="s2">wants to add something to this portion</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.820" end="00:16:07.370" style="s2">we can move on to the second portion</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.200" end="00:16:11.300" style="s2">I&#39;ll just give do you want to add</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.370" end="00:16:15.620" style="s2">something to this portion China this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.300" end="00:16:18.220" style="s2">the rant time is currently copied in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.620" end="00:16:21.050" style="s2">world with the menace</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.050" end="00:16:26.780" style="s2">agree with everything so far and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:30.370" style="s2">I&#39;m ready to move on to solution all</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.780" end="00:16:33.260" style="s2">right yeah now we can talk about our</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.370" end="00:16:36.350" style="s2">what does this look like in our perfect</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.260" end="00:16:38.360" style="s2">world as much as we can envision it 5 10</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.350" end="00:16:39.650" style="s2">100 years in the future however much you</p>

<p begin="00:16:39.650" end="00:16:44.360" style="s2">think that&#39;s plausible and they do not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.780" end="00:16:46.490" style="s2">need to match the hours can be three</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:03.320" style="s2">applied in a meta fashion is that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.300" end="00:17:05.540" style="s2">that all right all right because I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.320" end="00:17:07.880" style="s2">I think this notion applies right across</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.540" end="00:17:09.350" style="s2">right across the board so I mean just</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.880" end="00:17:10.490" style="s2">using my self energy to go up and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:17:10.490" end="00:17:15.410" style="s2">but I&#39;m just saying you know I I am able</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:16.760" style="s2">because I live in a place that past Sun</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:17.959" style="s2">most of the year right in the winter</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.760" end="00:17:19.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of a struggle I am</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.959" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">able to have a few solar panels on my</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.579" end="00:17:24.470" style="s2">roof and that&#39;s it no connection to grid</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">no emissions no nothing now exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.470" end="00:17:27.860" style="s2">the trade-off is with the mining and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:29.240" style="s2">materials that are used and the panels</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.860" end="00:17:30.980" style="s2">are good for maybe 15 years and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.240" end="00:17:32.690" style="s2">they need to be replaced and factoring</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.980" end="00:17:34.700" style="s2">all of that in over the lifetime of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.870" end="00:17:46.730" style="s2">but the what you were saying before</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.350" end="00:17:48.530" style="s2">Jubilee about having the information</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.730" end="00:17:50.900" style="s2">right the information needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.530" end="00:17:52.340" style="s2">accessible so that anyone can understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.900" end="00:17:55.040" style="s2">it easily without having to have a PhD</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.340" end="00:17:56.870" style="s2">in in in battery design right or</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.040" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">whatever to actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.870" end="00:18:01.610" style="s2">understand the information so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:04.670" style="s2">finding metrics that are a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.610" end="00:18:06.620" style="s2">and truthful and be easy for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.670" end="00:18:08.570" style="s2">layperson to understand right even if</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.620" end="00:18:11.720" style="s2">they have no training so something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.570" end="00:18:13.160" style="s2">energy for example is a pretty simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">one right so for the equation that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:18.920" style="s2">talking about with me using solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">to produce my powered rather than gas</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.920" end="00:18:22.760" style="s2">burnt at a power station and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:24.410" style="s2">transferred to me via cables with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.760" end="00:18:26.750" style="s2">loss of cables and the necessity to put</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.410" end="00:18:27.920" style="s2">up cables and maintain cables and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.750" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">and so on and so on right there&#39;s a cost</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.920" end="00:18:32.300" style="s2">to all of this needs to be factored into</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:34.040" style="s2">the overall equation but it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.300" end="00:18:36.590" style="s2">done so in such a way that you can read</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.040" end="00:18:38.930" style="s2">it and so energy in energy out right</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.590" end="00:18:40.430" style="s2">energy joules of energy required to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.930" end="00:18:42.230" style="s2">produce the thing joules of energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.430" end="00:18:44.960" style="s2">produced by the thing during its</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.230" end="00:18:47.000" style="s2">lifetime and this is a this is a and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.960" end="00:18:50.780" style="s2">this kind of metric I think could be</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.000" end="00:18:52.250" style="s2">pretty easily figured out for everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.780" end="00:18:54.380" style="s2">I mean foods a little tricky because</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.250" end="00:18:56.030" style="s2">food calories is not a great measure of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.380" end="00:18:57.320" style="s2">food right there&#39;s other nutritional</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.030" end="00:18:59.930" style="s2">things other than just the calorific</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.320" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">intake but you know we&#39;re through data</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.930" end="00:19:06.050" style="s2">but so and so two things firstly having</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.990" end="00:19:09.350" style="s2">this series of simple metrics that give</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.050" end="00:19:10.670" style="s2">a true reasonably so I mean a simple</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.350" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">metrics never going to give all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.670" end="00:19:14.180" style="s2">nuance right but but that broadly</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:20.180" style="s2">speaking gives a true picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.180" end="00:19:22.550" style="s2">situation and secondly having liked it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.180" end="00:19:24.800" style="s2">like fractal production in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.550" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">areas and so you know at an individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.800" end="00:19:29.480" style="s2">level a household has the capability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">produce some of its own power maybe heat</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.480" end="00:19:33.950" style="s2">some of its water with a tank on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:35.150" style="s2">roof grow some of its food in the garden</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.950" end="00:19:37.880" style="s2">that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.150" end="00:19:39.980" style="s2">a neighborhood collectively could have</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.880" end="00:19:42.140" style="s2">maybe a big diesel generator between</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.980" end="00:19:45.140" style="s2">them all for when there&#39;s a power outage</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.140" end="00:19:50.320" style="s2">and this kind of thing and so production</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.140" end="00:19:53.059" style="s2">and use being</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.320" end="00:19:54.950" style="s2">localized to the degree where it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.059" end="00:19:56.779" style="s2">sensible to do so right not that it has</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.950" end="00:19:59.149" style="s2">to be a dogma where everything must be</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.779" end="00:20:00.409" style="s2">this but where it is sensible to do so</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.149" end="00:20:01.610" style="s2">so food production is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.409" end="00:20:04.639" style="s2">sensible to do on a household by</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.610" end="00:20:06.499" style="s2">household basis but you know a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.639" end="00:20:08.059" style="s2">households maybe something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.499" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not as simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.059" end="00:20:11.210" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be adapted everybody but a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:13.730" style="s2">thousand households something like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.210" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">could be responsible for at least their</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.730" end="00:20:18.019" style="s2">fruit vegetable egg production for</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:19.970" style="s2">example right maybe meat dairy oil they</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.019" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">have to get from from elsewhere but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.970" end="00:20:25.669" style="s2">know that and so where it is sensible to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:28.159" style="s2">do so localized things and where things</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.669" end="00:20:30.169" style="s2">need to be big centralized things be big</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">centralized things and that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.169" end="00:20:37.429" style="s2">to me to be the foundation of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:40.369" style="s2">meta solution all right I will continue</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.429" end="00:20:43.279" style="s2">on I can try a minute we winnin if she</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.369" end="00:20:44.299" style="s2">want um met a solution it was like well</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.279" end="00:20:46.100" style="s2">you were talking about like wait this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.299" end="00:20:47.929" style="s2">the thing like this is this is if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.100" end="00:20:49.240" style="s2">have the tech go up if we have my</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.929" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">version and that is the better solution</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.240" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">but it&#39;s like what does that actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:56.809" style="s2">look like in five 10 20 years I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:20:58.610" style="s2">gonna give it a hundred because I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.809" end="00:21:00.950" style="s2">this is everything I talked about is</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.610" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">plausible in five 10 20 years once we</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.950" end="00:21:03.799" style="s2">get started and the solutions start</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:07.909" style="s2">snowballing and said if the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.799" end="00:21:09.889" style="s2">starts no Molly that exactly what Eric</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.909" end="00:21:12.289" style="s2">talked about having solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.889" end="00:21:13.549" style="s2">local makes sense local and having the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.289" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">ones that are collective and more</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.549" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">universal makes sense and having it make</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:22.279" style="s2">sense down to the individual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:24.230" style="s2">that you can choose where and how you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.279" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">get your energy clearly I can&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.230" end="00:21:29.090" style="s2">Vancouver and expecting to use only</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.499" style="s2">solar but Vancouver could even may</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.090" end="00:21:32.600" style="s2">Hoover could probably use some solar</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.499" end="00:21:35.090" style="s2">especially if its temptation so Lord</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.600" end="00:21:35.690" style="s2">when it&#39;s more efficient right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.090" end="00:21:37.460" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.690" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">thank you for probably should when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.460" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not a sufficient of the kebee</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">having access to information that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:46.309" style="s2">both trustworthy and usable meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:49.100" style="s2">you have that that surface level</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.309" end="00:21:50.509" style="s2">information that anyone can access this</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.100" end="00:21:52.190" style="s2">is what my six-year-old can understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.509" end="00:21:54.830" style="s2">seven oh my seven-year-old can</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.190" end="00:21:56.779" style="s2">understand on how batteries work and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.830" end="00:21:59.230" style="s2">solar power works and here&#39;s the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.779" end="00:22:02.269" style="s2">but you can get debt even a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.230" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">solar-powered engineer could get down</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.269" end="00:22:04.950" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:06.720" style="s2">the data and doubt like that you can get</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.950" end="00:22:08.280" style="s2">more more complex with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:11.340" style="s2">but there&#39;s still that surface level to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.280" end="00:22:13.620" style="s2">explain it to 90% of the people and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.340" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">if we have information we can trust and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.620" end="00:22:18.000" style="s2">use and the technology the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:20.220" style="s2">infrastructure to be able to connect</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.000" end="00:22:21.660" style="s2">with other people both at that local</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.220" end="00:22:23.700" style="s2">level hey who is growing what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.660" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">energy is coming from where how am i</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.700" end="00:22:28.770" style="s2">solving my needs and as I solved them</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">and that both everything feeds back into</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:33.720" style="s2">the system so if you start with a</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:36.330" style="s2">solution and healthcare a solution and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.720" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">education a solution and energy it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.330" end="00:22:40.680" style="s2">about that ever being the final solution</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:43.140" style="s2">it is about continually improving it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.680" end="00:22:45.230" style="s2">this in any way okay with what we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.140" end="00:22:48.300" style="s2">currently going on right a solar panel</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.230" end="00:22:51.030" style="s2">might not be able be better than than</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.300" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">oil right now but it&#39;s starting and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.030" end="00:22:55.020" style="s2">how do we get it more efficient how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:22:56.970" style="s2">we get the mining more efficient to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.020" end="00:22:59.010" style="s2">these resources how do we make it last</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.970" end="00:23:00.630" style="s2">longer how do we get more efficiency out</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.010" end="00:23:03.060" style="s2">of it is something we can crowdsource</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.630" end="00:23:04.770" style="s2">together and so this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.060" end="00:23:07.320" style="s2">having access to information that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.770" end="00:23:09.060" style="s2">trust and can use and access to the</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.070" end="00:23:14.490" style="s2">see wait we thought this was a solution</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.930" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">to education are people learning more</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.490" end="00:23:19.410" style="s2">are people enjoying this process and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:21.750" style="s2">this constant feedback from the user</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.500" end="00:23:50.760" style="s2">to use the solution I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">create a solar Factory</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.760" end="00:23:58.230" style="s2">I want to use the energy so I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">charge my devices so I can have a fridge</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.230" end="00:24:03.090" style="s2">so again like that is what I want so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:04.800" style="s2">want energy available to everyone at</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.090" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">that right I want energy available that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.800" end="00:24:09.960" style="s2">is efficient and cheap and all the good</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:11.700" style="s2">stuff without siphoning off profit to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.960" end="00:24:13.260" style="s2">give to shareholders or passing off</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.700" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">externalities onto everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.260" end="00:24:16.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where the data in the info come</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:19.570" style="s2">in so that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.360" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">and it&#39;s my vision of a future that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.570" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">would like to well it sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.809" end="00:24:33.429" style="s2">of course in my system all of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.080" end="00:24:36.309" style="s2">happening just like you and so in my</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.429" end="00:24:38.620" style="s2">future I see this counterbalancing</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.309" end="00:24:41.620" style="s2">system can told them it&#39;s decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.620" end="00:24:44.620" style="s2">actually like individually sand-like</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.620" end="00:24:50.289" style="s2">sovereign but yet we&#39;re recording the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.620" end="00:24:52.659" style="s2">data we know that it&#39;s legit because of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.289" end="00:24:55.330" style="s2">the data thread and the timestamp and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.659" end="00:24:57.639" style="s2">like it&#39;s not like coming from some</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.330" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">vague place that&#39;s coming from all of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.639" end="00:25:06.940" style="s2">we use this system to value all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">solutions that we&#39;re using and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.940" end="00:25:10.809" style="s2">monitor them and to track them and to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:13.419" style="s2">see exactly what&#39;s working what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.809" end="00:25:16.960" style="s2">working the system itself creates our</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.419" end="00:25:19.809" style="s2">interconnectivity and actual social</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.960" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">safety net so then if you do have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.809" end="00:25:26.049" style="s2">solar business that isn&#39;t as good as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">want for the environment you have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.049" end="00:25:29.980" style="s2">can either you know stop doing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:31.980" style="s2">business and have a safety net that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.980" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">catches you within your own community</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.980" end="00:25:38.889" style="s2">with value or you can just step back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:42.070" style="s2">reassess do some more science figure out</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.889" end="00:25:47.470" style="s2">another better way to solve it maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.070" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">purposely make factories to be easier to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.470" end="00:25:51.870" style="s2">transform so that we can make changes</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:56.649" style="s2">instead of just really rigid factories I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.870" end="00:26:01.330" style="s2">think that this is where we&#39;re going we</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.649" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">are becoming our own agents in the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.330" end="00:26:06.100" style="s2">to solve problems to be valued to not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">controlled by big business big</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.100" end="00:26:13.960" style="s2">corporations and by with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:15.490" style="s2">transparency we create trust that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.960" end="00:26:17.740" style="s2">where the trust comes from it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.490" end="00:26:23.380" style="s2">be hard to say oh everyone be totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.740" end="00:26:25.779" style="s2">transparent but as we build systems that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.380" end="00:26:27.640" style="s2">are transparent I think other people can</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.779" end="00:26:31.030" style="s2">see where the value is in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.640" end="00:26:35.320" style="s2">and then more people get on it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.030" end="00:26:38.200" style="s2">snowball effect we become more open to</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.320" end="00:26:42.070" style="s2">trying new stuff like I see in our</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.200" end="00:26:44.020" style="s2">communities in the future not too far</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.070" end="00:26:46.360" style="s2">where we have the opportunity to try</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.020" end="00:26:48.820" style="s2">different forms of energy creation let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.360" end="00:26:51.040" style="s2">save all this all these odd weird</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.820" end="00:26:53.680" style="s2">alternative ways that are never allowed</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.040" end="00:26:56.050" style="s2">because of our laws and corporations</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.680" end="00:27:00.850" style="s2">really make it difficult to test these</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.050" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">out once we have this counter structure</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.850" end="00:27:05.290" style="s2">set up I see people coming to their</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.360" style="s2">communities and saying I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.290" end="00:27:11.710" style="s2">this type of energy I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.360" end="00:27:14.560" style="s2">what is this that when you harvest from</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.710" end="00:27:15.850" style="s2">your waste it&#39;s not really geothermal is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.560" end="00:27:18.040" style="s2">it but anyway you know just different</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.850" end="00:27:19.720" style="s2">types that aren&#39;t really allowed you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.040" end="00:27:21.280" style="s2">come to your community you can set up a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.720" end="00:27:23.620" style="s2">proposal this is my house I want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.280" end="00:27:28.150" style="s2">design it it&#39;s very green bla bla bla I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.620" end="00:27:31.000" style="s2">want to share it as an</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.150" end="00:27:33.310" style="s2">information-gathering idea and if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.000" end="00:27:37.390" style="s2">works then you have all your tracking</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.310" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">all of my metrics for it and then if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.390" end="00:27:41.350" style="s2">does work people can also do it and try</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:43.780" style="s2">it as well in other places and we get to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.350" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">share that technology and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.780" end="00:27:48.940" style="s2">way to get around our rigid laws because</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:50.530" style="s2">we&#39;re so transparent with it and if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.940" end="00:27:52.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work then we can bounce back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.530" end="00:27:55.120" style="s2">be like okay new new solution how do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.690" end="00:27:57.550" style="s2">fix this problem I created but you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.120" end="00:27:59.920" style="s2">open about it that your community is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.550" end="00:28:02.800" style="s2">interested there also you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.920" end="00:28:07.000" style="s2">valuable I just think that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.800" end="00:28:10.450" style="s2">a world is so fulfilling and desirable</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.000" end="00:28:13.210" style="s2">because you&#39;re constantly important in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.450" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">your life and the life people around you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.210" end="00:28:18.930" style="s2">so probably really rancid and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:21.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.930" end="00:28:23.320" style="s2">all of our brilliant minds do that and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.640" end="00:28:25.030" style="s2">understood it and Eric understood it so</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.320" end="00:28:29.470" style="s2">we&#39;re good people in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.030" end="00:28:31.090" style="s2">understood I think my most articulate</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.470" end="00:28:37.180" style="s2">when I&#39;m renting I would really get up</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.090" end="00:28:38.730" style="s2">ahead of staring there was something I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.180" end="00:28:40.950" style="s2">wanted to say what was it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.730" end="00:28:43.210" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.950" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2"> it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.210" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;ll come back if it&#39;s meant to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:51.340" style="s2">yeah the they weird it is although I say</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.110" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">it every time the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.340" end="00:28:55.059" style="s2">section that our ideas don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:56.500" style="s2">match right we can just because it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.059" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">the whys we&#39;re arguing way I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.500" end="00:29:00.700" style="s2">that&#39;s feasible no that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.850" end="00:29:02.679" style="s2">priority there are actual versions of</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.700" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">the future almost always aligned it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.679" end="00:29:07.210" style="s2">that how we get there that doesn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:08.530" style="s2">that&#39;s still like and yet the Tenjin</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.210" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">because we&#39;re doing the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.530" end="00:29:12.460" style="s2">possible next that&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:15.340" style="s2">again we might disagree on what the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.460" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">adjacent possible is but most of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.340" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to argue that we need an</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">adjacent possible it&#39;s there yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:24.340" style="s2">all agree on the needs it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.260" style="s2">strategies where we may differ but we</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.340" end="00:29:27.909" style="s2">can all agree on the needs it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.260" end="00:29:29.260" style="s2">great model it&#39;s a great model that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.909" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">enviously I remember what I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.260" end="00:29:37.030" style="s2">say now by the way from an Alan Watts</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:38.950" style="s2">talk right that you won&#39;t these problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.030" end="00:29:42.100" style="s2">won&#39;t go away until you put the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.950" end="00:29:45.190" style="s2">direction of nature back in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.100" end="00:29:47.080" style="s2">nature right and and stop trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.190" end="00:29:51.669" style="s2">around with it just just let it do its</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.080" end="00:29:53.559" style="s2">thing and so yeah I mean it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.669" end="00:29:58.169" style="s2">an impossibility right we rely so</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.559" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">heavily on technology but it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.169" end="00:30:04.380" style="s2">part of the meta solution is about</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:06.490" style="s2">letting go of this need to control</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.380" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">everything in the world and everything</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.490" end="00:30:10.929" style="s2">in our lives right and yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">things like washing machines and and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.929" end="00:30:15.490" style="s2">you know hot water for showers and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">things like this and you know nice soft</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.490" end="00:30:18.400" style="s2">beds and all of that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.340" style="s2">lovely I&#39;m not saying get rid of all</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.400" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">that but I&#39;m just saying we need to at</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.340" end="00:30:25.390" style="s2">an individual level as well as at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">societal level really really ask</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.390" end="00:30:30.309" style="s2">ourselves the questions what is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:32.350" style="s2">minimum of the manipulation I can do to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.309" end="00:30:35.950" style="s2">nature what is the minimum I can extract</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.350" end="00:30:38.730" style="s2">from in order to have a life that is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.950" end="00:30:40.870" style="s2">know comfortable and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.730" end="00:30:42.820" style="s2">bountiful and whatever you know without</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.870" end="00:30:45.460" style="s2">without how just having tons of but</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.820" end="00:30:47.710" style="s2">you know that is a value system</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.460" end="00:30:49.950" style="s2">adjustment which has to come along with</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.020" end="00:30:59.770" style="s2">essential anything you track that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:31:02.380" style="s2">value the tracking of it and that brings</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.770" end="00:31:04.840" style="s2">us perfectly into the next section which</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.380" end="00:31:06.850" style="s2">is the adjacent possible now that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.840" end="00:31:08.710" style="s2">talked about what the world currently</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.850" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">looks like what the meta-crisis it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.710" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2"> show if you missed that part the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">second part our beautiful version of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:17.730" style="s2">future which is truly connected and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:20.770" style="s2">amazing and we have accesses information</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.730" end="00:31:23.140" style="s2">what is a step we could take towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.770" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">that beautiful future if we had 10,000</p>

<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">to create a solution and then make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.300" end="00:31:36.820" style="s2">better and for me it&#39;s transparency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.850" end="00:31:39.429" style="s2">creating a system that we trust to</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.820" end="00:31:41.820" style="s2">monitor what is currently going on that</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.429" end="00:31:44.200" style="s2">is only going on because it happens in</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.820" end="00:31:45.400" style="s2">complexity and secrecy right it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.200" end="00:31:48.700" style="s2">complicated to know it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.400" end="00:31:50.380" style="s2">overwhelming to know and it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.700" end="00:31:51.400" style="s2">proprietary to know well no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.380" end="00:31:53.290" style="s2">wait</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.400" end="00:31:54.309" style="s2">we know how mining works we know how</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.290" end="00:31:57.280" style="s2">unless you&#39;re gonna tell us you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.309" end="00:32:01.360" style="s2">mining works better we can make the map</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.280" end="00:32:03.100" style="s2">of our supply chain right what</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:04.900" style="s2">especially with alternative energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.100" end="00:32:06.429" style="s2">what does goes into a solar panel what</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.900" end="00:32:07.870" style="s2">solar panels are out there and how ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.429" end="00:32:10.150" style="s2">they mind and what goes into it what</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.870" end="00:32:12.730" style="s2">water what food what food food I guess</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.150" end="00:32:16.179" style="s2">but water and energy goes into creating</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.730" end="00:32:17.920" style="s2">us and those are the kind of things we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.179" end="00:32:19.420" style="s2">can create together in fact tons of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.920" end="00:32:21.130" style="s2">people are creating it it&#39;s just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.420" end="00:32:22.270" style="s2">not creating it together so then they</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.130" end="00:32:25.059" style="s2">have to sell it to everyone like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.270" end="00:32:27.940" style="s2">cool website that was postponed baby I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.059" end="00:32:30.040" style="s2">like cool and bear are you getting this</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.940" end="00:32:32.050" style="s2">information from and how do I trust you</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.040" end="00:32:34.540" style="s2">if I could just get that snapshot as</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.050" end="00:32:36.460" style="s2">soon as I was on that website yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.540" end="00:32:37.840" style="s2">anyone else had some because I I could</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.460" end="00:32:42.730" style="s2">go on but this is a cool half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.840" end="00:32:44.260" style="s2">and Jason possible my recommendation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.730" end="00:32:46.030" style="s2">take the hundred thousand dollars blow</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.260" end="00:32:47.770" style="s2">it on hookers and drugs because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.030" end="00:32:49.690" style="s2"> hopeless it doesn&#39;t matter what</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.770" end="00:32:50.980" style="s2">we come up with they will capture it</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.690" end="00:32:53.230" style="s2">they will manipulate it they will</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.980" end="00:32:54.730" style="s2">deceive us into thinking that something</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.230" end="00:32:56.020" style="s2">that they&#39;re making money out of is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.730" end="00:32:57.580" style="s2">thing that we want but it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.020" end="00:33:00.400" style="s2">the thing they want it just looks like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.580" end="00:33:03.220" style="s2">the thing that we want and yeah it just</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.400" end="00:33:04.870" style="s2">it seems to be an inescapable cycle</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.220" end="00:33:06.370" style="s2">until the whole thing collapse</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.870" end="00:33:08.170" style="s2">in ourselves so take your hundred grand</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.370" end="00:33:20.350" style="s2">and go and enjoy it and then when it</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.170" end="00:33:21.940" style="s2">runs out jump off a bridge every ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.350" end="00:33:27.610" style="s2">dollars on false pretences take the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.940" end="00:33:29.110" style="s2">hundred grand and go and blow it just go</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.610" end="00:33:32.309" style="s2">out with a bang</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.110" end="00:33:35.110" style="s2">I prefer because I agree like there</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.309" end="00:33:38.920" style="s2">everything is Co optimal everything but</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.110" end="00:33:41.290" style="s2">if we were doing it together it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.920" end="00:33:43.720" style="s2">much less co-op table it&#39;s so much less</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.290" end="00:33:46.110" style="s2">able to be used as a tool against us and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.720" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">transparency is a big part of that if</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.110" end="00:33:52.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no behind and so what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:33:54.100" style="s2">something if we had so again they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.300" end="00:33:56.620" style="s2">looking to create a solution for 7.5</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.100" end="00:33:58.390" style="s2">billion people but ten thousand so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.620" end="00:34:00.550" style="s2">would transparency look like to those</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.390" end="00:34:02.800" style="s2">ten thousand people what would get you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.550" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">to trust these solutions how would you</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.800" end="00:34:07.720" style="s2">know a solution is trustworthy how would</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:09.639" style="s2">you how do I want to know which solar</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.720" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">panel is the best not by listening to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.639" end="00:34:13.629" style="s2">the marketing from the solar panel</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:15.389" style="s2">people who are creating them I want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.629" end="00:34:18.250" style="s2">know the actual physics the chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.389" end="00:34:20.889" style="s2">involved in the creation of this and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.250" end="00:34:23.770" style="s2">can manipulate that a bit but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.889" end="00:34:25.510" style="s2">put like oh how did you create carbon</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.770" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">but there was no carbon here like then</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.510" end="00:34:29.470" style="s2">there&#39;s part that you can&#39;t lie about is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:32.169" style="s2">it&#39;s like well where this by-product go</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.470" end="00:34:36.010" style="s2">like you&#39;re missing a molecule here one</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.169" end="00:34:40.300" style="s2">cop into the nitrogen and there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.010" end="00:34:42.070" style="s2">transparency we can invoke on behalf is</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.300" end="00:34:43.750" style="s2">the wrong word but on behalf of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.070" end="00:34:45.460" style="s2">corporations and governments the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.750" end="00:34:46.629" style="s2">government used to have that rule right</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.460" end="00:34:47.980" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones we went to for</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.629" end="00:34:50.620" style="s2">information they gave us the food</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.980" end="00:34:52.330" style="s2">pyramid this is this is healthy in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.620" end="00:34:54.580" style="s2">dairy industry tell us do you daring me</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.330" end="00:34:56.830" style="s2">haha pretty sure dairies not really hard</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.580" end="00:34:58.630" style="s2">about that we don&#39;t trust them anymore</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.830" end="00:35:00.900" style="s2">but if we did what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.630" end="00:35:03.400" style="s2">we can create that for the ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.900" end="00:35:05.290" style="s2">Canada can&#39;t create that but ten</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.400" end="00:35:07.060" style="s2">thousand Canadians come together we</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.290" end="00:35:08.560" style="s2">could assess what a food pyramid should</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.060" end="00:35:10.540" style="s2">look like without the dairy industry</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.560" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">involved right I like dairy great and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.540" end="00:35:14.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t eat it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:16.900" style="s2">not on the pyramid it&#39;s not necessity</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.080" end="00:35:18.630" style="s2">it&#39;s you know what does that information</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.900" end="00:35:21.840" style="s2">source look like and how they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.630" end="00:35:24.420" style="s2">discredit us I can be discredited 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.840" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">of us coming together that&#39;s really hard</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.420" end="00:35:28.680" style="s2">to discredit that&#39;s hard to be like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:30.180" style="s2">would he trust and then create it versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.680" end="00:35:32.820" style="s2">me creating it and telling you to trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.180" end="00:35:34.590" style="s2">it yeah and then one of the 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.820" end="00:35:36.930" style="s2">accepts you know 50 grand from the New</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.590" end="00:35:38.790" style="s2">York Times to blow the lid on this crazy</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.930" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">bunch of hippies you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.790" end="00:35:42.450" style="s2">and and that&#39;s it the whole world thinks</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:44.730" style="s2">you&#39;re nuts because the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.450" end="00:35:49.370" style="s2">said so and and that&#39;s it no one will</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.730" end="00:35:52.230" style="s2">sell you anything know the information</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.370" end="00:35:59.880" style="s2">it so there is no blowing the lid off is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.230" end="00:36:01.380" style="s2">first of all we&#39;re doing it all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.880" end="00:36:02.580" style="s2">that there&#39;s zero possibility in those</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.380" end="00:36:04.410" style="s2">things happening it&#39;s that their way</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.580" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">lesson when we&#39;re transparent about how</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.410" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">we&#39;re creating it show us the lie right</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:12.830" style="s2">show me where Eric said that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.480" end="00:36:15.810" style="s2">what are you two like it&#39;s not finding</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.350" end="00:36:23.550" style="s2">right like there is no way to come and</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.550" end="00:36:28.050" style="s2">centered on an individual so even if</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:30.030" style="s2">that individual falls from grace it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.050" end="00:36:31.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fall apart the information</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.030" end="00:36:33.570" style="s2">itself you can pick apart for that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.530" end="00:36:36.390" style="s2">science cool awesome thanks for helping</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.570" end="00:36:39.480" style="s2">us right you can&#39;t create a new entity</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.390" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">that sounds like it&#39;s official you know</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">the world not then that it&#39;s like gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.260" end="00:36:58.740" style="s2">come to grow since making the Royal</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.740" end="00:37:06.330" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have transparency on my back</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.540" end="00:37:09.150" style="s2">right right if like who owns what and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.330" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">where&#39;s when we have the IMDB for</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.299" end="00:39:13.640" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t exist in my work it just</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.069" end="00:39:27.650" style="s2">just but the beautiful part is you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.059" end="00:39:29.059" style="s2">have if you have 10,000 people coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.650" end="00:39:31.309" style="s2">together and they&#39;ve said yes here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.059" end="00:39:34.220" style="s2">$10 they put their money where their</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.309" end="00:39:35.900" style="s2">mouth is those 10,000 people being</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.220" end="00:39:38.119" style="s2">involved in the solution like one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.900" end="00:39:40.819" style="s2">them can&#39;t really break it unless we let</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.119" end="00:39:43.009" style="s2">them like there isn&#39;t what are they</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.819" end="00:39:43.759" style="s2">gonna do and if they do it the first</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.009" end="00:39:45.889" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.759" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">awesome well I didn&#39;t see that come in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.889" end="00:39:49.969" style="s2">then we fix it wait you&#39;re bluffing</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:52.279" style="s2">oh look so what 10 co-opted I didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.969" end="00:39:53.809" style="s2">that happening then the next solution we</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.279" end="00:39:55.279" style="s2">don&#39;t allow like what could we have had</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.809" end="00:39:59.779" style="s2">in place to have make sure that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.279" end="00:40:02.149" style="s2">happen again and creating something for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.779" end="00:40:04.369" style="s2">purpose instead of for profit</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.149" end="00:40:06.289" style="s2">right now we&#39;re incentivized to lie you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.369" end="00:40:07.729" style="s2">can&#39;t be in honest solar company how</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.289" end="00:40:09.109" style="s2">would you possibly be out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.729" end="00:40:12.649" style="s2">world on selling your solar panels being</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.109" end="00:40:14.239" style="s2">like well it costs a thousand units of</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.649" end="00:40:17.269" style="s2">energy and you&#39;re only ever gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.239" end="00:40:18.679" style="s2">900 out of it but you know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.269" end="00:40:20.719" style="s2">paying for those thousand you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.679" end="00:40:22.489" style="s2">for the subsidized so you&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.719" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna pay you so it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.489" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">it&#39;s if you only waive that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.159" end="00:40:31.849" style="s2">all right that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.019" end="00:40:33.559" style="s2">know ok fair enough so I get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.849" end="00:40:36.380" style="s2">externalize 400 dollars you need so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.559" end="00:40:37.969" style="s2">still make 300 units out this cool you</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.380" end="00:40:39.229" style="s2">know and if people want to be like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.969" end="00:40:40.609" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be like that but at least</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.229" end="00:40:44.630" style="s2">it&#39;s on the table and they know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.609" end="00:40:46.219" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing yeah and we like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.630" end="00:40:48.349" style="s2">industry isn&#39;t good out of the goodness</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.219" end="00:40:49.909" style="s2">of their hearts and solar industry might</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.349" end="00:40:51.380" style="s2">because the good players might put their</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.909" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">information out there but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.380" end="00:40:55.909" style="s2">playing with the bad players and the bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:58.159" style="s2">players like what good are solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.909" end="00:41:00.380" style="s2">just flipped into existence with no</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.159" end="00:41:02.630" style="s2">energy or water input I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.380" end="00:41:04.579" style="s2">you did that was broken but like that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.630" end="00:41:06.889" style="s2">there&#39;s an invoke of transparency on</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.579" end="00:41:09.889" style="s2">behalf on our behalf like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.889" end="00:41:11.149" style="s2">information and there&#39;s also that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.889" end="00:41:12.499" style="s2">piece in Torah I have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.149" end="00:41:14.029" style="s2">with Freeman together this is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.499" end="00:41:17.089" style="s2">we&#39;re starting is on the transparency</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.029" end="00:41:18.589" style="s2">piece because he thinks lets me just put</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.089" end="00:41:20.419" style="s2">words in his mouth that like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.589" end="00:41:22.039" style="s2">you don&#39;t invoke transparency on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.419" end="00:41:23.689" style="s2">of the other and I&#39;m like oh we invoke</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.039" end="00:41:25.789" style="s2">transparency on behalf of the other when</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.689" end="00:41:27.709" style="s2">the others entire existence is about</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.789" end="00:41:30.019" style="s2">profit and about keeping us in the dark</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.709" end="00:41:32.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t exist if they&#39;re in the light</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.019" end="00:41:34.549" style="s2">then they shouldn&#39;t exist and we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.630" end="00:41:38.809" style="s2">give them the light but they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.549" end="00:41:40.909" style="s2">that we want and that&#39;s an incentive in</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.809" end="00:41:43.729" style="s2">a way because we are the customer of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.909" end="00:41:46.039" style="s2">their business so eventually as we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.729" end="00:41:48.679" style="s2">having more transparency and we do see</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.039" end="00:41:52.639" style="s2">that they that&#39;s incentive for them to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.679" end="00:41:55.669" style="s2">change their ways and be more green</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.639" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">whatever it is actually green but yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.669" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">three more</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:02.670" style="s2">anymore cause the pressure that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:05.400" style="s2">masses need to have to be able to put on</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.670" end="00:42:08.040" style="s2">them I think that&#39;s exactly where we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.400" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">go once we have this system and and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.040" end="00:42:10.740" style="s2">love that you brought Raymond in because</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.330" end="00:42:14.490" style="s2">of course that was where I was going</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.740" end="00:42:16.920" style="s2">next I would love to see like I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.490" end="00:42:18.540" style="s2">that you I think it&#39;s very similar like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.920" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">when you talk about your 10,000 people I</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.540" end="00:42:25.710" style="s2">think they&#39;re near you and so if anybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:27.030" style="s2">within your 10,000 has that problem or</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.710" end="00:42:29.310" style="s2">does something Shady</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.030" end="00:42:32.490" style="s2">it&#39;s all in there like everybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.310" end="00:42:34.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s incentive to for people not to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.490" end="00:42:35.970" style="s2">be associated as well even though we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.200" end="00:42:38.010" style="s2">all driven because we&#39;re part of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.970" end="00:42:39.810" style="s2">game a system right now I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.010" end="00:42:41.369" style="s2">how we think the winners think that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.810" end="00:42:46.470" style="s2">and that&#39;s how they&#39;re gonna be winners</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.369" end="00:42:48.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s so the transparency really I</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.470" end="00:42:53.580" style="s2">think makes people try to be their best</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.690" end="00:42:56.250" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s key so in my big</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.580" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">world vision I would love for the 10</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.250" end="00:43:03.140" style="s2">whatever ten thousand hundred thousand I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:05.369" style="s2">would say this multi-level system of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.140" end="00:43:07.080" style="s2">metrics which is probably a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.369" end="00:43:10.740" style="s2">Raymond is talking about I listened to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.080" end="00:43:13.320" style="s2">your your video and it sounds exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.740" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">the same I must is my system because</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.320" end="00:43:18.390" style="s2">we&#39;re both coming from that meta</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:20.730" style="s2">currency project idea so by being able</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.390" end="00:43:25.140" style="s2">to see these different connections</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.730" end="00:43:29.400" style="s2">within people in the planet and all this</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.140" end="00:43:32.430" style="s2">it&#39;s the currencies I would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.400" end="00:43:35.460" style="s2">able to offer go to communities offer</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.430" end="00:43:38.010" style="s2">this value system to a community and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.460" end="00:43:40.680" style="s2">hopefully there&#39;s 10 dozen or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.010" end="00:43:44.940" style="s2">however many people and just let them</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.680" end="00:43:47.490" style="s2">start to record and map their different</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.940" end="00:43:49.530" style="s2">currencies which sounds weird is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.490" end="00:43:51.869" style="s2">hard to describe currency and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.530" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">currency project it&#39;s really just being</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.869" end="00:43:58.980" style="s2">able to visualize see an exchange in</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:44:01.230" style="s2">different levels so anyway they start to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.980" end="00:44:02.550" style="s2">map their own value what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.230" end="00:44:04.349" style="s2">if they&#39;re recycling and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.550" end="00:44:10.260" style="s2">starting to map that themselves so there</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.349" end="00:44:14.280" style="s2">is a way to value it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.260" end="00:44:16.350" style="s2">start to build that entire mapping</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.280" end="00:44:18.240" style="s2">system so I then you go to another</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.350" end="00:44:20.220" style="s2">community and let them start theirs and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.240" end="00:44:22.830" style="s2">it starts to build and eventually we do</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.220" end="00:44:25.410" style="s2">have this worldwide mapping system that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.830" end="00:44:28.290" style="s2">is showing where the externalities are</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.410" end="00:44:29.640" style="s2">where we&#39;ve been proved on our own where</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.290" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">we&#39;re putting the pressure on other</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.640" end="00:44:37.380" style="s2">corporations to do the same those are</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.060" style="s2">people to work through a solution with</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.380" end="00:44:43.410" style="s2">and figure out what their values are</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.060" end="00:44:45.720" style="s2">like my focus is on the very much needed</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.410" end="00:44:48.390" style="s2">other side of that that it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.720" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">finding where can we start mapping our</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.390" end="00:44:51.930" style="s2">data as individuals what out of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:53.370" style="s2">10,000 could we use right so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.930" end="00:44:55.260" style="s2">finding 10,000 Vancouverites we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.370" end="00:44:57.210" style="s2">mapping everything it&#39;s like finding</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.260" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">10,000 people globally and mapping where</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.210" end="00:45:01.830" style="s2">we&#39;re finding right well how much are we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.910" style="s2">paying what are we eating I was like so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.830" end="00:45:05.670" style="s2">that something can come out of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.910" end="00:45:07.530" style="s2">right but that&#39;s not necessarily what</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.670" end="00:45:11.400" style="s2">the solution raising is this is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.530" end="00:45:13.110" style="s2">it is more of a system of that right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.400" end="00:45:14.970" style="s2">like what what would a food app that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.110" end="00:45:16.050" style="s2">wanted to put your data into and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.970" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2">you&#39;re getting out of it you can get</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.050" end="00:45:18.840" style="s2">something out of your data and to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.700" end="00:45:20.820" style="s2">able to put your data in because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.840" end="00:45:22.320" style="s2">not going to put tons of time in what</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.820" end="00:45:24.060" style="s2">I&#39;m heating when I&#39;m not getting recipes</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.320" end="00:45:26.520" style="s2">out of it or I&#39;m not getting suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.060" end="00:45:30.540" style="s2">or not I need something write it as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.520" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">solution so that I am like I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.540" end="00:45:37.260" style="s2">would probably involved in it in any in</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:39.750" style="s2">any level but with yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.260" end="00:45:42.030" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying hi my brain actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.750" end="00:45:43.950" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s on something and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.030" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">not it&#39;s not on anything at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.950" end="00:45:57.000" style="s2">good times good times it&#39;s on meta</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:46:00.750" style="s2">solution but I do think with 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.000" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">people any like even having a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.750" end="00:46:04.800" style="s2">people that actually understood the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:08.190" style="s2">chemistry right having like a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.800" end="00:46:10.950" style="s2">stand but instead of five billionaires</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.190" end="00:46:12.630" style="s2">seeing if your idea is worthy enough so</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.950" end="00:46:15.660" style="s2">sharks tank is what it&#39;s known each day</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.630" end="00:46:17.490" style="s2">it&#39;s having those ideas be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.660" end="00:46:19.590" style="s2">seen and then or will we invest in it</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.490" end="00:46:21.150" style="s2">having five or six people look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.590" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">being like oh yeah this is the best</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.150" end="00:46:23.559" style="s2">solar count not because we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:25.239" style="s2">invest</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.559" end="00:46:27.279" style="s2">because now my money is here and I get</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.239" end="00:46:28.479" style="s2">all this money but like no compared to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.279" end="00:46:29.949" style="s2">the other ones out there like what does</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.479" end="00:46:31.449" style="s2">it look like what does it look like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.949" end="00:46:32.859" style="s2">be the best seller panel what are the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.449" end="00:46:34.959" style="s2">metrics and how can anyone put those</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.859" end="00:46:37.569" style="s2">metrics in right like Eric has solar</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.959" end="00:46:38.949" style="s2">panels there&#39;s that on the box what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.569" end="00:46:40.599" style="s2">says it does and then there&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.949" end="00:46:43.420" style="s2">actually doing for Eric Eric could be</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.599" end="00:46:45.160" style="s2">feeding that information though it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.420" end="00:46:47.499" style="s2">interesting point actually that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.160" end="00:46:50.979" style="s2">here because the thing is I&#39;m not I I</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.499" end="00:46:53.079" style="s2">would actually have no nothing to offer</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.979" end="00:46:54.789" style="s2">other than personal anecdotal experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.079" end="00:46:57.189" style="s2">which is that they are sufficient right</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.789" end="00:46:58.569" style="s2">it&#39;s enough sometimes in the winter you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.189" end="00:47:00.549" style="s2">know when there&#39;s only like seven or</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.569" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">eight hours of daylight anyway and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.549" end="00:47:03.339" style="s2">overcast all day I need to run the</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:05.199" style="s2">generator for a couple of hours to talk</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.339" end="00:47:07.029" style="s2">the batteries up which means I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.199" end="00:47:08.769" style="s2">petrol right which is which is not great</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.029" end="00:47:10.299" style="s2">but it&#39;s that&#39;s the price you pay with</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.769" end="00:47:12.279" style="s2">solar is that you don&#39;t always always</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.299" end="00:47:14.499" style="s2">have enough Sun during the summer even</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.279" end="00:47:15.579" style="s2">on overcast days it&#39;s enough and so but</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.499" end="00:47:18.579" style="s2">yeah I mean I couldn&#39;t give you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.579" end="00:47:19.779" style="s2">numerical data on how much it produces</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.579" end="00:47:21.880" style="s2">do you know what I mean I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.779" end="00:47:23.439" style="s2">that seven panels is good enough more</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.880" end="00:47:25.660" style="s2">than enough actually most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.439" end="00:47:27.759" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s part of it right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.660" end="00:47:28.989" style="s2">it&#39;s if we&#39;re feeding data back into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.759" end="00:47:31.029" style="s2">system it&#39;s not necess</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.989" end="00:47:32.140" style="s2">where you&#39;re like a Tuesday afternoon I</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.029" end="00:47:33.849" style="s2">didn&#39;t have enough well that information</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.140" end="00:47:34.900" style="s2">we know that it&#39;s overcast because we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.849" end="00:47:37.599" style="s2">know what it&#39;s doing in Spain at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.900" end="00:47:39.369" style="s2">time if there was other people putting</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.599" end="00:47:41.199" style="s2">their information and and you then are</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.369" end="00:47:42.819" style="s2">like wait I&#39;m using solar but this</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.199" end="00:47:44.019" style="s2">person my neighbor who have remain</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.819" end="00:47:47.410" style="s2">indoors I didn&#39;t even know was using</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.019" end="00:47:48.670" style="s2">wind that you were you could use theirs</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.410" end="00:47:50.799" style="s2">during that time and they could use</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.670" end="00:47:52.630" style="s2">yours right like you can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.799" end="00:47:54.549" style="s2">numbers and if we need the numbers from</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.630" end="00:47:55.989" style="s2">you we&#39;re gonna need to send you an</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.549" end="00:47:59.199" style="s2">equipment right or you&#39;re gonna need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.989" end="00:48:01.509" style="s2">buy the equipment like we need to meet</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.199" end="00:48:02.949" style="s2">people where they are which is like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.509" end="00:48:04.269" style="s2">use them I don&#39;t know how they work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.949" end="00:48:05.890" style="s2">like okay we&#39;ll plug this in tell us</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.269" end="00:48:06.699" style="s2">what the meter reads right I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.890" end="00:48:08.829" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.699" end="00:48:10.359" style="s2">but those and then that could be a tool</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.829" end="00:48:12.339" style="s2">library right we&#39;re like okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.359" end="00:48:13.269" style="s2">gonna send this out to you do it for a</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.339" end="00:48:14.920" style="s2">month then you&#39;re gonna send it to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.269" end="00:48:16.839" style="s2">someone else is gonna do it for mum or</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.920" end="00:48:18.519" style="s2">it stays at yours and constantly as</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.839" end="00:48:20.140" style="s2">smart and feeds back into the system</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.519" end="00:48:22.239" style="s2">when you need more power and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.140" end="00:48:25.779" style="s2">not able to do it and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.239" end="00:48:27.009" style="s2">information that it&#39;s again you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.779" end="00:48:28.329" style="s2">gonna feed that in if you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.009" end="00:48:29.709" style="s2">anything but what you&#39;re getting is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.329" end="00:48:32.589" style="s2">idea that maybe your neighbor has a</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.709" end="00:48:34.479" style="s2">solution right and as those things start</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.589" end="00:48:36.869" style="s2">to come together if we already have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.479" end="00:48:38.579" style="s2">the power grid online</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.869" end="00:48:40.859" style="s2">it was like anyone who&#39;s using anything</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.579" end="00:48:42.779" style="s2">alternative put your information in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.859" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">a threshold of people once once enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.779" end="00:48:45.990" style="s2">people are honored it paid it pays for</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.220" style="s2">itself in information right you wants</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.990" end="00:48:49.799" style="s2">what your information is you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.220" end="00:48:51.059" style="s2">information oh but it&#39;s it&#39;s reaching</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.799" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">that threshold which to me is something</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.059" end="00:48:55.079" style="s2">we can do much more easily together by</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:57.299" style="s2">saying hey ten thousand people in Spain</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.079" end="00:48:58.829" style="s2">who have their own energy want to create</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.299" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">an energy grid just to say how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.829" end="00:49:03.269" style="s2">doing it how that&#39;s working yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:05.039" style="s2">not there&#39;s not one within miles of me I</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.269" end="00:49:06.839" style="s2">mean I&#39;m the I am literally the only one</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.039" end="00:49:09.240" style="s2">for miles and miles around no no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.839" end="00:49:11.339" style="s2">just saying that no but I I know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.240" end="00:49:14.130" style="s2">a very specific just me example but but</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.339" end="00:49:17.369" style="s2">this is a general point right that these</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.130" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">these 10,000 people used for many things</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.369" end="00:49:21.749" style="s2">not all things but for many things need</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:23.339" style="s2">to be within reasonable proximity of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.749" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">each other and so the question then</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.339" end="00:49:28.859" style="s2">becomes well who&#39;s going to actually you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">know pick up their clipboard and go and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.859" end="00:49:32.279" style="s2">start knocking on doors using themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:33.509" style="s2">and actually drumming up 10 the own</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.279" end="00:49:35.430" style="s2">beginnings drum up sent that or at least</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.509" end="00:49:36.930" style="s2">arming up 100 so that each of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.430" end="00:49:40.499" style="s2">hundreds and then go and drum up send</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.930" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">more and write as somebody who would</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.499" end="00:49:44.489" style="s2">love to live off the grid but I also I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:47.160" style="s2">not really gonna do that what do you not</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.489" end="00:49:48.869" style="s2">buy myself anyway it might be that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.160" end="00:49:51.269" style="s2">put yourself on that map</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.869" end="00:49:52.859" style="s2">and there is nobody within a big</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.269" end="00:49:54.539" style="s2">distance of you but someone else in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.859" end="00:49:56.039" style="s2">Spain wants to do what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.539" end="00:49:57.539" style="s2">they could connect with you as a mentor</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.039" end="00:49:59.309" style="s2">and then you don&#39;t I mean they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.539" end="00:50:01.349" style="s2">probably gonna move close to you so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.309" end="00:50:03.150" style="s2">could start that power grid and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.349" end="00:50:04.349" style="s2">once there&#39;s two of you the third person</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.150" end="00:50:06.269" style="s2">is more likely to join you like it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.349" end="00:50:08.489" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you need 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.269" end="00:50:10.980" style="s2">people together it can coalesce together</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.489" end="00:50:12.900" style="s2">around that if what we&#39;re creating makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.980" end="00:50:14.249" style="s2">that makes sense right again you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.900" end="00:50:15.509" style="s2">gonna put your information in unless</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.249" end="00:50:17.069" style="s2">there&#39;s something to gain that game</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.509" end="00:50:18.749" style="s2">might be that you&#39;re waiting months or</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.069" end="00:50:21.329" style="s2">years for other people to come and see</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.749" end="00:50:23.369" style="s2">you if it&#39;s not costing you anything and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.329" end="00:50:26.130" style="s2">it&#39;s just just that you exist and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.369" end="00:50:28.890" style="s2">have seven solar panels right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.130" end="00:50:30.539" style="s2">know you see right now if I did put my</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.890" end="00:50:31.559" style="s2">information out there then I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.539" end="00:50:33.059" style="s2">someone from the government coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.559" end="00:50:34.529" style="s2">around demanding tax from me I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.059" end="00:50:37.049" style="s2">don&#39;t know I have it cuz I post it from</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.529" end="00:50:38.999" style="s2">the UK but right now even if you&#39;re off</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.049" end="00:50:44.789" style="s2">grid I believe you are required to pay -</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.999" end="00:50:46.799" style="s2">for what why why do I have to pay you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.789" end="00:50:51.079" style="s2">I&#39;m using absolutely nothing of your</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.799" end="00:50:51.079" style="s2"> so ya know so what</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.630" end="00:50:57.410" style="s2">I think it was when I was talking to max</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.940" end="00:51:01.549" style="s2">Porter&#39;s but I might have the person</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.410" end="00:51:04.099" style="s2">wrong that we were talking about I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.549" end="00:51:06.680" style="s2">think it was max a solution to like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.099" end="00:51:08.420" style="s2">uber right break basically broke the law</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.680" end="00:51:10.369" style="s2">to come into existence there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.420" end="00:51:11.540" style="s2">gray area laws where it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.369" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">quite illegal cuz we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.540" end="00:51:15.829" style="s2">it&#39;s a possibility and if we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:17.750" style="s2">it out in the open we actually couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.829" end="00:51:19.670" style="s2">create it but uber can create uber and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.750" end="00:51:20.540" style="s2">then now we can because to do like uber</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.670" end="00:51:22.819" style="s2">exists you&#39;re not gonna let the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.540" end="00:51:26.089" style="s2">collective one exists that isn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.819" end="00:51:27.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a truth to that that if we all</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.089" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">had our information in the system on</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.829" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">that we&#39;re living off grid and our</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.140" style="s2">governments can tax us there&#39;s a cost to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:34.819" style="s2">that right that now we have to get taxed</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.140" end="00:51:36.650" style="s2">or we didn&#39;t have to before there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.819" end="00:51:38.569" style="s2">some amount of cost of transparency on</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.650" end="00:51:40.130" style="s2">some of those things which is also why</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.569" end="00:51:43.609" style="s2">we might want to start our transparency</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.130" end="00:51:45.290" style="s2">onto them and not on us right or on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.609" end="00:51:47.119" style="s2">US where if there&#39;s enough of us</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.290" end="00:51:48.589" style="s2">involved guaranteed someone&#39;s like wait</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.119" end="00:51:50.569" style="s2">I usually put our information in here</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.589" end="00:51:52.670" style="s2">the government can find us and start</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.569" end="00:51:54.410" style="s2">taxing us so one we need to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.670" end="00:51:56.990" style="s2">secure where it&#39;s just the data we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.410" end="00:51:58.430" style="s2">know we can&#39;t trace it back to Eric but</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.990" end="00:52:00.140" style="s2">then how do you find your neighbors but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.430" end="00:52:02.210" style="s2">they don&#39;t like there&#39;s there&#39;s stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.140" end="00:52:04.280" style="s2">be gained with transparency cost with</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.210" end="00:52:06.890" style="s2">transparency if we had a million of us</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.280" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">on the grid in Europe who are like</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.890" end="00:52:11.809" style="s2">listen your technology isn&#39;t really a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:13.160" style="s2">solution I&#39;ve come up with my own</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.809" end="00:52:15.170" style="s2">solution and we&#39;re coming up with a</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.160" end="00:52:16.819" style="s2">solution you have enough people to like</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.170" end="00:52:20.390" style="s2">change the law in a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.819" end="00:52:22.490" style="s2">lobbyists can&#39;t compete with right</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.390" end="00:52:24.589" style="s2">because if we have money and the actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.490" end="00:52:26.869" style="s2">voting power that&#39;s not a lobbyist</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.589" end="00:52:28.819" style="s2">that&#39;s like democracy more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.869" end="00:52:29.809" style="s2">actually supposed to be doing but they</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.819" end="00:52:33.470" style="s2">have to counteract that with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.809" end="00:52:35.030" style="s2">lobbyists like we we can start changing</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.470" end="00:52:37.010" style="s2">and breaking laws when there&#39;s enough of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.030" end="00:52:38.750" style="s2">us and we have to own that as part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.010" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">our process that we can&#39;t start with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.750" end="00:52:42.049" style="s2">things that are gonna cost us money when</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:43.730" style="s2">it comes on the open like barter systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.049" end="00:52:45.349" style="s2">there&#39;s been a ton of barter systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.730" end="00:52:46.970" style="s2">online that have been tried to be put up</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.349" end="00:52:48.500" style="s2">right you give an hour of your time I</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.970" end="00:52:51.319" style="s2">give an hour of my time we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.500" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">freely in that exchange they break down</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.319" end="00:52:54.740" style="s2">because the government start taxing them</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:57.530" style="s2">so you&#39;re a lawyer you gave an hour of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.740" end="00:52:58.849" style="s2">your time I want taxes on the $500 even</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.530" end="00:53:01.880" style="s2">though you only got an hour plumbing out</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.849" end="00:53:03.589" style="s2">of it yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.880" end="00:53:08.029" style="s2">I have a lot to say about all the you</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.589" end="00:53:12.549" style="s2">guys have talked about there um I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.029" end="00:53:15.140" style="s2">that to get around that the taxing part</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.549" end="00:53:18.999" style="s2">well there&#39;s so many levels here okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.140" end="00:53:21.650" style="s2">for one I would say what if this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.999" end="00:53:24.519" style="s2">counterbalancing system actually values</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.650" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re using solar air and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.519" end="00:53:29.960" style="s2">every three months or so just report</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.440" end="00:53:33.769" style="s2">back yes I mean I&#39;m fully sustainable on</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.960" end="00:53:36.859" style="s2">solar and then that is valued not in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.769" end="00:53:41.960" style="s2">monetary as in money exchange but in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.859" end="00:53:43.369" style="s2">way that is anchoring that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.960" end="00:53:44.539" style="s2">valuable you&#39;re becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.369" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">sustainable I mean that&#39;s the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.539" end="00:53:52.309" style="s2">goal with this gained me is to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:54.289" style="s2">sustainable so there&#39;s a as as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.309" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">building your own value that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.289" end="00:53:58.940" style="s2">reporting back to your community other</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:02.269" style="s2">people would be interested in and also</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.940" end="00:54:04.309" style="s2">want to do it but another thing another</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.269" end="00:54:08.719" style="s2">connection with this underlying system</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.309" end="00:54:11.779" style="s2">is the fact that we become the GUP to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.719" end="00:54:14.029" style="s2">pencil ownership of yourself you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.779" end="00:54:15.229" style="s2">need to be also responsible if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.029" end="00:54:16.839" style="s2">going to be sustainable you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.229" end="00:54:21.650" style="s2">responsible but that&#39;s in a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.839" end="00:54:24.019" style="s2">governance so we take on I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.650" end="00:54:25.880" style="s2">we start to Co govern with our</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.019" end="00:54:28.579" style="s2">governments so they&#39;re still there and</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.880" end="00:54:31.279" style="s2">they&#39;re like propping up game a or</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.579" end="00:54:34.759" style="s2">whatever but then game B is another form</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.279" end="00:54:36.499" style="s2">of governance so that we are able to not</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.759" end="00:54:38.749" style="s2">pay taxes to them because we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.499" end="00:54:40.880" style="s2">the responsibility that supposedly we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.749" end="00:54:42.589" style="s2">given them and that&#39;s why we pay taxes</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.880" end="00:54:45.170" style="s2">so that they can take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.589" end="00:54:47.719" style="s2">us so we start doing our own recycling</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.170" end="00:54:50.390" style="s2">we build those programs into our</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.719" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">recycling in our local areas we get a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.390" end="00:54:56.239" style="s2">value system that&#39;s recognizing that so</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:57.859" style="s2">then we&#39;re paying less taxes from our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.239" end="00:55:00.880" style="s2">community we&#39;re becoming more</p>

<p begin="01:02:00.600" end="01:02:03.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do we make clothes from</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.190" end="01:02:06.120" style="s2">scratch because we&#39;re eventually gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.450" end="01:02:07.830" style="s2">need them in a sustainable way and make</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.120" end="01:02:11.190" style="s2">our wardrobe sustainable right like how</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.830" end="01:02:13.260" style="s2">many pieces do you need and how can we</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.190" end="01:02:15.990" style="s2">help you with that as opposed to dictate</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.260" end="01:02:17.850" style="s2">what that is best of both worlds is</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.990" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">really easily spoke right you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.850" end="01:02:22.290" style="s2">clothing exchanges in the high street</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:23.940" style="s2">right and so at home you might have four</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.290" end="01:02:25.170" style="s2">or five outfits when you get tired of</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.940" end="01:02:26.760" style="s2">one of them you bring it down there you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.170" end="01:02:28.290" style="s2">dump it there you grab a couple of new</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.760" end="01:02:29.730" style="s2">ones you take them home and then when</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.290" end="01:02:31.470" style="s2">you&#39;re tired of those you bring them and</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.730" end="01:02:33.360" style="s2">so and then when they wear out they wear</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.470" end="01:02:35.340" style="s2">out and the material is recycled in</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.360" end="01:02:36.930" style="s2">whatever way it can be I mean it down</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.340" end="01:02:39.270" style="s2">the road further when we can do this</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.930" end="01:02:40.980" style="s2">printing clothes right and so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.270" end="01:02:43.230" style="s2">download a design off the internet you</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.980" end="01:02:44.970" style="s2">print it out you wear it you throw it in</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.230" end="01:02:46.260" style="s2">the thing it recycles when you print</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.970" end="01:02:48.660" style="s2">something else out of it you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.260" end="01:02:50.730" style="s2">this is this is the future sweet you</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.660" end="01:02:55.770" style="s2">don&#39;t need to have any clothes what you</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.730" end="01:02:57.720" style="s2">want when you want it I just get radical</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.770" end="01:03:00.270" style="s2">you know and then once ignited in</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.720" end="01:03:04.770" style="s2">addition I was going to say with this</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.270" end="01:03:07.410" style="s2">multi-level system that I&#39;m picturing it</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.770" end="01:03:09.840" style="s2">really helps to show that buying all</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.410" end="01:03:12.060" style="s2">those clothes and things isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.840" end="01:03:15.530" style="s2">satisfying but you could be recording</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.060" end="01:03:19.740" style="s2">how by doing all of this renewable type</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.530" end="01:03:22.770" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s more satisfying because</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.740" end="01:03:24.450" style="s2">you&#39;re purposely trying to make an</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.770" end="01:03:26.220" style="s2">impact a positive impact in the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.450" end="01:03:28.170" style="s2">and so you can see it in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.220" end="01:03:31.380" style="s2">multi-level value sister for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.170" end="01:03:33.950" style="s2">and then other people can see it from</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.380" end="01:03:36.300" style="s2">you and you can share it anyway I just</p>
