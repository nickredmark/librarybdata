<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:06.450" style="s2">are you shocked at the amount of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.629" end="00:00:08.280" style="s2">that live in Western societies here in</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.450" end="00:00:09.660" style="s2">Norway especially when we were in Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.280" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">a couple days ago but all the countries</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been in that live in free</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">societies yet are completely afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:22.170" style="s2">say what they think is it absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">shocking to you I think the most I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.170" end="00:00:27.349" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been most shocked about in all</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:30.269" style="s2">of that is what&#39;s happened in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.349" end="00:00:32.430" style="s2">with the police starting to prosecute</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.269" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">people for crimes of offensiveness</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.430" end="00:00:37.860" style="s2">that&#39;s just and I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:39.960" style="s2">partly because I&#39;m and I mean I see that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.860" end="00:00:41.550" style="s2">as broadly reflective of something</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.960" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in the West in general</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s particularly shocking and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">appalling to me as a Western Canadian no</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.680" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">because obviously COUNTA that was part</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:53.250" style="s2">of the British Empire and when I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:55.739" style="s2">like there was a pretty tight affinity</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.250" end="00:00:58.680" style="s2">still in Western Canada with the British</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.739" end="00:01:00.989" style="s2">Empire I mean our maps were the Dominion</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.680" end="00:01:02.280" style="s2">of Canada it was still pink you know it</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.989" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">was still part of the British Empire</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.280" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">we sang god save the queen constantly at</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:12.390" style="s2">public gatherings that&#39;s gone by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:15.869" style="s2">wayside and so and you know I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.390" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">regarded British common law and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.869" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">British parliamentary tradition as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">one of it perhaps the highest</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">achievement of Western civilization I</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">mean you could argue about that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">it&#39;s in the top ten let&#39;s say and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">to see the Brits who also have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">phenomenal sense of humor this ability</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:38.430" style="s2">to say anything no matter how outrageous</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.850" style="s2">about anyone and to include themselves</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.430" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">in the joke right which is such an</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.850" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">elegant way of expressing comedic</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">freedom to see them going down this road</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">it&#39;s just it just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">it exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">well it&#39;s deeply saddening that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">sure and and what&#39;s horrifying and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:03.329" style="s2">not the exactly the right word I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">know what the word for it is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.329" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">certainly sorrow that&#39;s associated with</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">a disbelief it&#39;s also that at at</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">watching that happen and what I still</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">think is like the central</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">core of the idea of individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:21.330" style="s2">sovereignty and freedom as expressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">across the Western world and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.330" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">there&#39;s similar manifestations of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">everywhere else but the police for</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:31.110" style="s2">prosecuting people for you know asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">people to turn in their neighbors if</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.110" end="00:02:34.799" style="s2">they say something offensive and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:37.049" style="s2">happening in in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.799" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">yeah litter what we saw that that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.049" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">know somebody sent me posters pictures</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:45.390" style="s2">of posters in the in the Scottish subway</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">in the in the Metro in the tube you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.390" end="00:02:50.670" style="s2">saying inviting people to inform on</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">their neighbors for being offensive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.670" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">like what what the hell what so I knew</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.610" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">this was coming because because I knew</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">we brought our first hate speech laws in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">in Canada back in the 1980s we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">after this character named Ernst z√ºndel</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:10.730" style="s2">who is a particularly despicable piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:13.799" style="s2">of work hard hat wearing right-wing</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.799" end="00:03:25.620" style="s2">had it all that guy and you know it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">his shenanigans careless malevolent</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.620" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">shenanigans that enticed Canadians into</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">producing hate speech legislation I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">thought no that&#39;s that&#39;s not good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">not good you&#39;re making a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pay for this it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:46.049" style="s2">unfold over a long time who defines hate</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">the crucial issue it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:55.049" style="s2">answer is those whom you least want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.950" end="00:03:56.310" style="s2">have the power to define it because</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.049" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that will take that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.310" end="00:03:59.970" style="s2">power to themselves and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.380" end="00:04:01.859" style="s2">that isn&#39;t gonna affect what you get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.970" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">say well you&#39;ve got another thing coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.859" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:14.849" style="s2">pay for it and hopefully hopefully will</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">wake up and push back before we have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.849" end="00:04:21.419" style="s2">pay too high a price we&#39;re gonna pay for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:23.659" style="s2">it so yeah and we&#39;re gonna deserve to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.419" end="00:04:33.449" style="s2">pay for it too</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.659" end="00:04:36.449" style="s2">he&#39;s talking to you what you know last</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.449" end="00:04:38.580" style="s2">night last night I was on this British</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.580" end="00:04:44.129" style="s2">famous British show and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.419" end="00:04:45.900" style="s2">woman parliamentarian there from Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.129" end="00:04:50.099" style="s2">who it was pretty bright I liked</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.900" end="00:04:52.469" style="s2">listening to her but the the host asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.099" end="00:04:54.469" style="s2">me about this character named count dank</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.469" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">EULA I don&#39;t know if you know about him</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.469" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">his girlfriend he&#39;s a comedian well he</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:04.259" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s a comedian and well but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:05.430" style="s2">know there are lots of comedians who</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.259" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">think they&#39;re comedians that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.430" end="00:05:09.330" style="s2">funny and and I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.340" style="s2">funny cuz other people think that he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.330" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">comedian too but he presents himself as</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.340" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">a comedian count Dane Killa I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a joke that name and his</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:25.229" style="s2">dank ulam because he hated that pug and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.199" end="00:05:27.569" style="s2">I&#39;m not very fond of pugs I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.229" end="00:05:32.039" style="s2">they&#39;re hideous little creatures and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.569" end="00:05:33.900" style="s2">and and you know I don&#39;t really hate</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.900" end="00:05:38.219" style="s2">it and everything but it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:40.139" style="s2">like the the this little rat like dog</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.219" end="00:05:42.599" style="s2">with these bugs but you know if you hit</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.139" end="00:05:45.690" style="s2">a pug on the back of the head the eyes</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.599" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">will pop out and so because they&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.270" end="00:06:10.620" style="s2">and he loved it to death and so and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.370" end="00:06:13.169" style="s2">know that&#39;s fine that&#39;s fine but and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.620" end="00:06:15.659" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an ironic attitude in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.169" end="00:06:18.089" style="s2">the dismissal of pugs and dank EULA</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.659" end="00:06:19.949" style="s2">didn&#39;t like his girlfriend&#39;s pug and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.089" end="00:06:22.740" style="s2">he thought he played a mean trick and or</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.740" end="00:06:26.849" style="s2">a Heil Hitler salute which I actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.990" end="00:06:29.069" style="s2">thought was quite funny it&#39;s like I</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.349" end="00:08:25.979" style="s2">and by uttering it she also</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:28.050" style="s2">simultaneously transcended it you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.979" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s the beauty of comedy and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.050" end="00:08:33.510" style="s2">and well so anyways they they went after</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:09:05.190" style="s2">well it&#39;s you&#39;re not that morally</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:06.779" style="s2">virtuous to notice that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.190" end="00:09:08.279" style="s2">know what I mean it&#39;s like and it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.779" end="00:09:10.860" style="s2">have anything to do with the topic at</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.279" end="00:09:12.390" style="s2">hand it&#39;s like yeah you wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.860" end="00:09:13.860" style="s2">that you noticed that unless you were</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.390" end="00:09:15.720" style="s2">implying that were people there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.860" end="00:09:19.829" style="s2">people around you including this count</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.720" end="00:09:21.450" style="s2">dank EULA who didn&#39;t notice that okay it</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.829" end="00:09:23.520" style="s2">had nothing to do with whether he should</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.450" end="00:09:26.339" style="s2">have been prosecuted for his stupid joke</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.520" end="00:09:28.079" style="s2">and they even say well you could say it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.339" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">was a stupid joke which it certainly was</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.079" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">you could say that it was a hateful joke</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">which I don&#39;t agree with by the way but</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.420" style="s2">you could say that and I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.270" style="s2">you can make a credible case for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.420" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">but then to say that because</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.270" end="00:09:42.620" style="s2">you think that the Holocaust was bad he</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:45.020" style="s2">should be criminally prosecuted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:47.570" style="s2">like no sorry man you&#39;ve crossed the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.020" end="00:09:52.010" style="s2">line and there&#39;s no excuse for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.570" end="00:09:54.590" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of what&#39;s worrisome</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:56.990" style="s2">about the state of discourse in in the</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.840" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">person who gets to tell the truth and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.820" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">the King is such a tyrant that he kills</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.470" end="00:10:17.150" style="s2">this gesture then you know that the evil</p>
