<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:09.389" style="s2">begins in childhood I was born I was an</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.470" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">80s child more than two weeks into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.389" end="00:00:15.000" style="s2">80s and that definitely flavored my</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:19.590" style="s2">childhood because it was a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.000" end="00:00:24.119" style="s2">time I had I was born in Edmonton raised</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.590" end="00:00:25.619" style="s2">in like housing cooperatives so there</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.119" end="00:00:27.630" style="s2">were a lot of kids around a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.619" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">families and very little parental</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.630" end="00:00:32.880" style="s2">supervision so we figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">keep ourselves entertained we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.880" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">called in for dark the beginning Epsilon</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">I was in grade 3 was a very like a fun</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">chaos well we were still an evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:50.129" style="s2">Christian family going to church twice a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:54.710" style="s2">Sunday and having that as the coners</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.129" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">cornerstone of our family then my dad</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.710" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">finished his master&#39;s degree in library</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">studies what if we beat a librarian and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:09.960" style="s2">he got a job at the left bridge public</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">library so we moved to left mr. B didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.960" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">move to left which we moved to Raymond</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">which was a small town populated 90% by</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">Mormons which was not our religion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:22.950" style="s2">so we didn&#39;t really fit in and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:24.540" style="s2">hang out with mostly my siblings and my</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.950" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">fantasy what I&#39;ll probably got even more</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.540" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t kind of it did get more in-depth</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">I spent more time in books and less time</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:33.659" style="s2">with other people we were with other</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">people they were trying to convert us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.659" end="00:01:44.130" style="s2">their religion I was probably into my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:47.930" style="s2">religion and I went to seven different</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">elementary schools in grade by grade sex</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.930" end="00:01:51.869" style="s2">even though there was only like two big</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">moves from Edmonton to Raymond from</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.869" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">Raymond to last bridge finally Bodhi you</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">think a year and a half later so I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">constantly having to make new friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">without really having the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">make new friends I yeah my fantasy life</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">was probably the key to making them</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">because when you&#39;re a child and you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:15.790" style="s2">access to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:17.830" style="s2">fantasy imagination and you can bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.790" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">other people into that world at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.830" end="00:02:22.450" style="s2">when you&#39;re pretty young that&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:24.880" style="s2">great trait to have I however they</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.450" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">outgrew it right kids outgrow fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.880" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">and I never did I like my older sister</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:32.260" style="s2">outgrew fantasy and so I started playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:35.520" style="s2">with my younger brother and then he</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.260" end="00:02:40.870" style="s2">outgrew fantasy and I found friends who</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.520" end="00:02:42.970" style="s2">that was their their Miche so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.870" end="00:02:47.290" style="s2">childhood consisted of moving around a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.970" end="00:02:49.420" style="s2">lot changing friends having God and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.290" end="00:02:51.490" style="s2">Jesus is my central focus and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.420" end="00:02:53.140" style="s2">important it was that everybody find out</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.490" end="00:02:55.930" style="s2">about Jesus so that the second coming of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:59.830" style="s2">Christ could happen singing in church on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.930" end="00:03:01.270" style="s2">Sundays reading the Bible I read the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.830" end="00:03:02.860" style="s2">Bible through for the first and only</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.270" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">time when I was in grade four and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.860" end="00:03:11.530" style="s2">cover-to-cover Jesus fantasy and moving</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:16.810" style="s2">around a lot that was my childhood and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.530" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">then just the 80s the we watch TV we</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.810" end="00:03:21.850" style="s2">thought Nintendo when I was in grade six</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.670" end="00:03:24.370" style="s2">so I like childhood childhood didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.850" end="00:03:25.870" style="s2">have electronics we didn&#39;t have cables</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.370" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">we didn&#39;t spend a lot of time on on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.870" end="00:03:31.060" style="s2">television I read a lot of books</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:33.370" style="s2">especially with my dad being a librarian</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.060" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">and escaped into those fantasy worlds</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.370" end="00:03:38.050" style="s2">and created my own I remember having a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">field trip where we walked it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.050" end="00:03:42.100" style="s2">probably like a half an hour to 45</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:43.959" style="s2">minute walk and telling this story which</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.100" end="00:03:46.120" style="s2">I wish I would have recorded I remember</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.959" end="00:03:48.310" style="s2">there was like a big white lion maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.120" end="00:03:51.010" style="s2">ripped off from Narnia which was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.310" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">series my parents read to us like if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.010" end="00:03:54.490" style="s2">had been a kid in the late 90s I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:57.550" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to read Harry</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.490" end="00:04:03.430" style="s2">Potter but because like witchcraft would</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.550" end="00:04:05.440" style="s2">have been very very bad and yet we read</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.430" end="00:04:08.560" style="s2">Nardi XRD and was written by a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:10.690" style="s2">and then I was allowed to read like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.560" end="00:04:13.170" style="s2">artists I&#39;ve and and I don&#39;t know my</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.690" end="00:04:16.450" style="s2">parents were very wishy-washy like we</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.170" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">some years we would practice we would go</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.450" end="00:04:19.239" style="s2">trick-or-treating in other years he</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.650" end="00:04:21.580" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it kind of depended on which</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.239" end="00:04:23.680" style="s2">church we were going into what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.580" end="00:04:24.990" style="s2">flavor of their Christianity was that</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">zero did I mention I recorded this a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.330" end="00:04:39.160" style="s2">times that I am the middle child of an</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:41.289" style="s2">older sister and a younger brother which</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.160" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">is also very much you can&#39;t not have</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.570" end="00:04:56.500" style="s2">want to rock the boat I could see my</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.970" end="00:04:59.050" style="s2">older sister and younger brother needing</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.500" end="00:05:04.389" style="s2">a lot of attention and so I kind of slid</p>
