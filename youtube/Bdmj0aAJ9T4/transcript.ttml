<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:21.770" style="s2">kind of go into the guts of the book and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:25.350" style="s2">the underlying distinctions and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.770" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">that&#39;s really reformulating what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.350" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">notion of a self is and then a start to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:35.750" style="s2">begin to ask what is authenticity from</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">this new or more fully revealed</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.750" end="00:01:40.770" style="s2">understanding of self and what I really</p>

<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">reading it being it it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.430" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">kind of skim off the top because I it it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">catches some originality that goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">really down like really deep and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">you were talking about like what it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to look back on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:43.260" style="s2">because this was your first book yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">was and it you know yeah you said it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.260" end="00:02:48.960" style="s2">was my dissertation and I wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:51.990" style="s2">largely from 97 to 98 it was defended 98</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.960" end="00:02:53.790" style="s2">and then I removed the chapter and did a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.990" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">lot of rewriting then when I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.790" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">published yes it is you know it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">feel like a stranger wrote it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">do feel like it&#39;s mine and I recognize</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:06.270" style="s2">it but it feels very distant at this</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">point it feels you know so but so long</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.270" end="00:03:12.390" style="s2">ago that I look at them like I was kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:13.710" style="s2">of in a different ed space then right</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.390" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">because that it was part of your</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.710" end="00:03:17.610" style="s2">dissertation go right which is like when</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">you&#39;re writing a dissertation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.610" end="00:03:21.420" style="s2">basically of the people that I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">that who&#39;ve written dissertations like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.420" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">man that&#39;s the only thing they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s like so I have hair pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">long at the time and right when I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">taking my tree limbs I was sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">and I was reading I was sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:39.900" style="s2">reading a history cause at the time to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">basically the rough draft time and my</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.900" end="00:03:44.580" style="s2">hair kept like irritating me and was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">like falling in my face and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.580" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">that&#39;s it and I went into the bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">got a scissors just started clubbing it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:04:14.910" style="s2">I shaved my head swimming and it scared</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">people tonsure shaving yeah I mean God I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.910" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">just how old were you that but at that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">point about 23 or 28 so at 28 so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">just to imagine it&#39;s like at 28</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">and you grew up in a small town in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:36.390" style="s2">woods in Wisconsin great yeah you go to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:36.390" style="s2">college and then you end up in a PhD</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.980" end="00:04:43.150" style="s2">right and then you&#39;re sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.780" end="00:04:45.940" style="s2">reading Heidegger right the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.150" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">time right which is not an easy but well</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.940" end="00:04:50.350" style="s2">nothing in Heidegger is easy</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.490" end="00:04:52.840" style="s2">what&#39;s the hell like just rejecting them</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.350" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a little tiny volume that he did</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.840" end="00:04:57.550" style="s2">yet called the concept of time he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">like a 1924 lecture isn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.550" end="00:05:03.070" style="s2">but the history the concept of time that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.220" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">was the it&#39;s kind of like the rough</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.070" end="00:05:07.480" style="s2">draft to be in a time where he includes</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:10.660" style="s2">a lot of the stuff from being in time</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.480" end="00:05:12.670" style="s2">but it has this for like front-loaded a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.660" end="00:05:15.670" style="s2">hundred hundred fifty page years worth</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.670" end="00:05:18.690" style="s2">of history motion of intentionality how</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.670" end="00:05:20.380" style="s2">intentionality phenomenology sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.690" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.380" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">grounding his project in so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:29.230" style="s2">ceiling and legacy he existential eyes</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.980" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">for rules notion of intentionality my</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.230" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">brilliant hyphens into all of his</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:36.760" style="s2">expressions so it&#39;s relation that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:40.360" style="s2">notion of important of directing one</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.760" end="00:05:42.640" style="s2">southward lately he inscribed it into</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.360" end="00:05:46.630" style="s2">the language rather than just explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.640" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">echoing but you can see it much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.630" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">explicitly when you look at so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">history of time and then there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:53.980" style="s2">time and then basic problems of</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">phenomenology basic problems of</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.980" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">phenomenology is roughly I would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:02.140" style="s2">been like something like division three</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:05.800" style="s2">fields have been follows up yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.140" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">yeah Division three I mean that like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.800" end="00:06:11.650" style="s2">last division division two of being in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:12.520" style="s2">time it&#39;s fun it&#39;s it&#39;s funny - have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.650" end="00:06:36.490" style="s2">ever listened to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.520" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">dreyfuses lectures yeah yeah me too yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.490" end="00:06:40.420" style="s2">it&#39;s funny to watch him</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:45.040" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to that whole thing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.420" end="00:06:47.320" style="s2">just stumped by it right um and he does</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.040" end="00:06:48.850" style="s2">I think it&#39;s like from hit the way he</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.320" end="00:06:52.330" style="s2">talks about it anyways he&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.850" end="00:06:57.100" style="s2">it&#39;s Heidegger had to like rush that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.330" end="00:06:59.980" style="s2">that into print right and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.100" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">like all kinds of orders right things</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.980" end="00:07:02.740" style="s2">and this is where it&#39;s actually being</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:04.090" style="s2">dyslexic it&#39;s kind of interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.740" end="00:07:06.700" style="s2">know because it&#39;s like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.090" end="00:07:08.710" style="s2">dyslexic if something&#39;s out of order it</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.700" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">seems to be you have to work through it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.710" end="00:07:13.300" style="s2">you end up learning it like really</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.460" style="s2">learning it because you have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.300" end="00:07:17.590" style="s2">crawl around the edges and kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.460" end="00:07:20.410" style="s2">it out and I was wondering about with</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.590" end="00:07:23.410" style="s2">your book like I kept having this sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.410" end="00:07:25.330" style="s2">I&#39;m like I can&#39;t imagine just laying</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.410" end="00:07:28.720" style="s2">this out right</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.330" end="00:07:31.480" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t imagine just laying it out um</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.720" end="00:07:32.770" style="s2">and then writing it like outlining and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.480" end="00:07:34.840" style="s2">you&#39;re writing it I just I kept</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.770" end="00:07:36.730" style="s2">imagining like you wrote one thing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.840" end="00:07:39.190" style="s2">you realize oh I got to talk about this</p>

<p begin="00:11:04.010" end="00:11:07.940" style="s2">no alibi and I was doing a lot of like</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:40.370" style="s2">lot to do working with youth there was</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.340" end="00:11:43.070" style="s2">that you don&#39;t really discover what</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.070" end="00:11:46.910" style="s2">was a certain point where you sort of</p>

<p begin="00:11:49.670" end="00:11:53.180" style="s2">themselves and there&#39;s a lot of sub</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.410" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">playing and a lot of discipline where</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.180" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">you got to get up in the morning you</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.320" end="00:11:58.850" style="s2">have to have a very routine sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:01.850" style="s2">know again a discipline organization of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.850" end="00:12:04.250" style="s2">it but I think you know that that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.850" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">part of the the insights that I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.250" end="00:12:07.730" style="s2">trying out like I said whose Bach team</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:09.820" style="s2">you know social Bakhtin&#39;s sort of</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.400" end="00:12:18.770" style="s2">you say to somebody look back over your</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.700" end="00:12:21.020" style="s2">life look back over all of your life</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.770" end="00:12:22.640" style="s2">like right now you do the metro and</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.640" end="00:12:27.590" style="s2">did now ask yourself of all the things</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.670" end="00:12:30.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve done when you look back could you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.590" end="00:12:32.180" style="s2">have done otherwise than he did so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.140" end="00:12:34.490" style="s2">you were twenty you had a decision to do</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.490" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">and then when you were 30 other choice</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.590" end="00:12:50.300" style="s2">alternative right and I think what party</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.570" end="00:12:52.520" style="s2">would say is that when we look back in</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.300" end="00:12:54.410" style="s2">our lives when we do that and I think me</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.970" end="00:14:45.660" style="s2">like we think of it like there&#39;s a past</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.079" end="00:14:47.790" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the present and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.660" end="00:14:50.010" style="s2">the future and then once we&#39;ve cast it</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.790" end="00:14:51.990" style="s2">that way it&#39;s really easy to see the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.010" end="00:14:53.670" style="s2">present and decision-making that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.990" end="00:14:55.610" style="s2">squeezed out so it&#39;s like the past</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.670" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">suddenly it seems like it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.610" end="00:15:02.250" style="s2">unchangeable irrevocable like the past</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.800" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">already happened we see that&#39;s powering</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.250" end="00:15:05.699" style="s2">the past it&#39;s set in stone and then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:07.589" style="s2">were the futures like all future its</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.699" end="00:15:10.350" style="s2">uncertainty who knows what the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.589" end="00:15:13.949" style="s2">will bring us and there&#39;s uncertainties</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.350" end="00:15:16.019" style="s2">and possibilities and consequences and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.949" end="00:15:18.600" style="s2">then you have this present and sake the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.019" end="00:15:20.730" style="s2">present it&#39;s squeezed and squeezed more</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.600" end="00:15:22.980" style="s2">and more between a future you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.730" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">predict and a past that&#39;s beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.980" end="00:15:27.329" style="s2">control because it&#39;s already happened</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:28.529" style="s2">and if instead you go that&#39;s all problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.329" end="00:15:28.810" style="s2">there&#39;s just a bit of talking you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.529" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">going</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.810" end="00:15:34.870" style="s2">yourself there&#39;s really just two kinds</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:37.870" style="s2">of pasts there is there&#39;s the past that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.870" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">was and the past that will have been</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.870" end="00:15:45.520" style="s2">what we call the future is really a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">have been past and so you actively move</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.520" end="00:15:51.010" style="s2">toward the past sentencing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">accomplishments and deeds which once</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.010" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">they are done they now cannot be done</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.540" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">yeah I was like you know I need to write</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.520" end="00:16:11.880" style="s2">this book or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">and once I&#39;ve written it ever be there</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.880" end="00:16:20.650" style="s2">yeah totally interesting interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:25.060" style="s2">in the enlivening this of totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.650" end="00:16:27.370" style="s2">getting it down to your bones seems to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.060" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">be something about because if I totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.370" end="00:16:33.670" style="s2">get that right all the way down to my</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:35.230" style="s2">bones I mean what strikes me is all of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.670" end="00:16:36.820" style="s2">sudden when I look to the future the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.230" end="00:16:42.550" style="s2">future becomes something really</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.820" end="00:16:45.400" style="s2">different right then then then if I kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.550" end="00:16:47.890" style="s2">of haunt myself with not having that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.400" end="00:16:49.180" style="s2">such an interesting thing to say you</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.890" end="00:16:50.970" style="s2">think that it could have been otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.180" end="00:16:54.430" style="s2">or I could have done otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.970" end="00:17:03.220" style="s2">right it&#39;s judgment there is to pretend</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.430" end="00:17:13.390" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t there you couldn&#39;t have done</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.220" end="00:17:17.770" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re denying my agency we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.390" end="00:17:20.410" style="s2">cover the agency you have your stomach</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.770" end="00:17:22.870" style="s2">swing that out ahead of yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.410" end="00:17:25.020" style="s2">know you can&#39;t as like moving your sails</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.870" end="00:17:27.579" style="s2">or having good the sails themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.020" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">yourself to a past which once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.579" end="00:17:35.830" style="s2">done it yeah Oh interesting so that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:40.030" style="s2">wondering about if something like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.830" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">starts to get at high there is no notion</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.030" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:49.500" style="s2">aluminous sure right like that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.380" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">yeah can you take can you spin that into</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.500" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">into things because that that&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.580" end="00:17:57.490" style="s2">thing of i resoluteness in the way he</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:59.230" style="s2">talks about it in being in time isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.490" end="00:18:02.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t obvious to me what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.230" end="00:18:07.179" style="s2">yeah but it starts to get more obvious</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.020" end="00:18:09.159" style="s2">here yeah I mean I guess I I think some</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.179" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">of this gets ambiguous in Heidegger that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.159" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">you know in some way I think it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">responding to the call to conscience and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">individually oneself out of das mom know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:26.440" style="s2">we in almost everyday sense we lose</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:28.510" style="s2">ourselves into the public way of how</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.440" end="00:18:31.809" style="s2">things are yeah when I think for</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">Heidegger in some way the the call</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.809" end="00:18:37.169" style="s2">toward conscience is a contoured</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:43.210" style="s2">authenticity and it&#39;s about resolute</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.169" end="00:18:44.770" style="s2">with my decisions knowing in some way</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.210" end="00:18:48.010" style="s2">they&#39;re all lived in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.770" end="00:18:50.529" style="s2">knowing that I will die once I know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.010" end="00:18:54.850" style="s2">I will die it means that all decisions</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.529" end="00:18:56.740" style="s2">can&#39;t be just made equal because I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.850" end="00:18:58.960" style="s2">to decide some of them rather than</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.740" end="00:19:00.610" style="s2">others like if I was gonna die there be</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.960" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">a need to prioritize anything so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.610" end="00:19:04.870" style="s2">always just do it later you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:07.419" style="s2">that one later once you really get it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.870" end="00:19:09.309" style="s2">into your head that you would die part</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.419" end="00:19:13.080" style="s2">of the fabric of yourself understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.309" end="00:19:15.429" style="s2">now life was a bunch of priorities and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.080" end="00:19:17.350" style="s2">what would you be here this story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.429" end="00:19:19.210" style="s2">like I&#39;m it&#39;s really popular so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.350" end="00:19:21.159" style="s2">embarrassed to repeat it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.210" end="00:19:23.409" style="s2">it&#39;s worth telling but this guy telling</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.159" end="00:19:26.169" style="s2">the story about time management this</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.409" end="00:19:28.450" style="s2">guy&#39;s had this big glass jar and he</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.169" end="00:19:30.970" style="s2">pulls out the glass jar and he they</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.450" end="00:19:33.520" style="s2">pulls out this big container of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.970" end="00:19:35.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just six big rocks to like the size</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.520" end="00:19:37.570" style="s2">of a fist or whatever he takes each Rock</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.500" end="00:19:40.029" style="s2">and he fits it into the glass jar and</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.570" end="00:19:44.470" style="s2">then he says to everyone is the jar full</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.029" end="00:19:46.059" style="s2">and people are like no I&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.470" end="00:19:48.250" style="s2">you&#39;re asking he says okay very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.059" end="00:19:50.679" style="s2">he comes up he pulls out a bag of gravel</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.250" end="00:19:53.399" style="s2">and he starts putting gravel into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.679" end="00:19:55.970" style="s2">jar and tumblin all are</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.399" end="00:19:58.739" style="s2">which is the jar full and people like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.970" end="00:20:03.559" style="s2">yeah I think he goes okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.739" end="00:20:07.279" style="s2">he boasts and whose plants and a nurse</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.559" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">and then he says isn&#39;t clear now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.279" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">people like I think it&#39;s probably pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:25.259" style="s2">full of water and he says a full mouth</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:26.850" style="s2">and everybody goes yes it&#39;s full and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.259" end="00:20:29.609" style="s2">goes very good what&#39;s the moral of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.850" end="00:20:31.559" style="s2">story and so eager person in the Front&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.609" end="00:20:33.690" style="s2">like Oh point is is that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.559" end="00:20:35.429" style="s2">a little free time you one make the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.690" end="00:20:36.989" style="s2">of your time you&#39;ve got to make sure to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.429" end="00:20:39.149" style="s2">look for the little nooks and crannies</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.989" end="00:20:39.869" style="s2">to find the extra space to get it all in</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.149" end="00:20:41.249" style="s2">there and blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.869" end="00:20:42.899" style="s2">he goes no that&#39;s not the point at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.249" end="00:20:44.730" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention the point is you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.899" end="00:20:49.080" style="s2">don&#39;t start with the big rocks you never</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.730" end="00:21:00.179" style="s2">get them all into the jar and so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.080" end="00:21:15.809" style="s2">really big rocks first I&#39;ve never heard</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.179" end="00:21:21.169" style="s2">that that&#39;s great the so I thought it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.809" end="00:21:21.169" style="s2">be great just to read the very last</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.830" end="00:21:31.409" style="s2">thing you say about authenticity here</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.570" end="00:21:33.029" style="s2">first at the summary and then just start</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.409" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">to kind of look because this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.029" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">leads to almost to everything else</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.480" end="00:22:00.580" style="s2">you say authenticity viewed in these</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.140" end="00:22:05.799" style="s2">lights is not in any way a radical</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.580" end="00:22:09.640" style="s2">autonomy or a total freedom to do one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.799" end="00:22:15.030" style="s2">own thing it is not an egotistical drive</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.640" end="00:22:20.070" style="s2">of personal ambition nor is it a selfish</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.030" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">profiteering but neither is it a slavish</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:31.380" style="s2">situational impingements the middle way</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:34.600" style="s2">most rightly characterizes authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.380" end="00:22:39.429" style="s2">thus we must be ready to live with</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.520" end="00:23:04.140" style="s2">authenticity is the practice of openness</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.780" end="00:23:44.110" style="s2">it is a duty duty full autonomy one</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:46.120" style="s2">liberated by indebtedness yeah a fitting</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.110" end="00:23:49.990" style="s2">response it&#39;s like a key concept in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.120" end="00:23:52.870" style="s2">strods writings where the fitting</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.990" end="00:23:55.260" style="s2">response is an attempt to create a epics</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.870" end="00:24:00.870" style="s2">that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:24:03.809" style="s2">based in some extra transcendental realm</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.870" end="00:24:05.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not an ethical absolute the nor is</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.809" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">it a kind of willy-nilly we make it up</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.730" end="00:24:12.059" style="s2">as we go along like moral subjectivism</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:15.179" style="s2">it&#39;s about the hermeneutics of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.179" end="00:24:19.559" style="s2">is the current social historical</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.559" end="00:24:24.179" style="s2">way to respond yeah and so what I do a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.870" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">lot of stuff are you know that it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.179" end="00:24:29.580" style="s2">dot it&#39;s an autonomy liberated by</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:34.019" style="s2">indebtedness I think part of the hassle</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.580" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">is that I think so many people they</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.019" end="00:24:39.929" style="s2">they&#39;re unaware of the thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:41.909" style="s2">years worth of technological innovation</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.929" end="00:24:44.549" style="s2">that was involved in their de tribal</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.909" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">ization and their sense of themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.549" end="00:24:50.190" style="s2">a discrete separate individual that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">we&#39;re much more community and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.190" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">collectively grounded than we come and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:57.630" style="s2">you realize and I think what once people</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:25:00.510" style="s2">really get that sense they realized that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.630" end="00:25:03.090" style="s2">their autonomy their their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.510" end="00:25:05.250" style="s2">freedom has been liberated by other</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.090" end="00:25:07.860" style="s2">people it&#39;s been by parents who</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.250" end="00:25:10.919" style="s2">disciplined them who made them become</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.860" end="00:25:13.010" style="s2">literate maybe you know capacitated them</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.919" end="00:25:19.169" style="s2">in various ways by putting constraints</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.010" end="00:25:23.309" style="s2">upon them and so it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.169" end="00:25:25.860" style="s2">find you know the space where we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.309" end="00:25:28.919" style="s2">recognize ourselves as partly other</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.860" end="00:25:32.760" style="s2">people as partly the world as partly</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.919" end="00:25:34.559" style="s2">social historical players rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.760" end="00:25:36.510" style="s2">this sort of discrete anti mystic</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.559" end="00:25:38.490" style="s2">individual which i think it&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.510" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">money in literacy which fund the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.490" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">illusion of the the self-sufficing</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:50.039" style="s2">individual right which which too in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:55.049" style="s2">illusion is illusionary precisely</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.039" end="00:25:57.870" style="s2">because it starts thinking after the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.049" end="00:26:00.330" style="s2">history that created that basically like</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.870" end="00:26:03.299" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t account for it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.330" end="00:26:05.970" style="s2">account for all of the historical and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.299" end="00:26:08.310" style="s2">and existential and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.970" end="00:26:10.680" style="s2">relations that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.310" end="00:26:12.510" style="s2">fashioned it up such that it can have it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.680" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">can have those thoughts right in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.510" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">way I mean in some way to I think you</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:22.590" style="s2">know that that ending is trying to deal</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">with the opening which you know I began</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.590" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">with Taylor and the Boosters and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:30.030" style="s2">knockers so when when the quest of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:32.820" style="s2">authenticity surrogates thrown down upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:35.490" style="s2">people as profound self-awareness is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.820" end="00:26:38.130" style="s2">settling in through mass education</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.490" end="00:26:39.330" style="s2">systems largely the 20th century but</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.130" end="00:26:40.950" style="s2">maybe a little bit before that but</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.330" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">completely in the 20th century we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.950" end="00:26:45.270" style="s2">all parts of the drive toward</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:47.790" style="s2">authenticity well then the boosters are</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.270" end="00:26:50.130" style="s2">like yeah each person has a right to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.790" end="00:26:51.330" style="s2">live their life and the knockers are</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.130" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">like hey there&#39;s bigger meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.330" end="00:26:54.600" style="s2">structures you can&#39;t just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:57.210" style="s2">threatening you know a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.600" end="00:26:59.370" style="s2">meaninglessness and ilysm and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.210" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">chaos and moral relativity in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.370" end="00:27:05.850" style="s2">boosters like yeah but it&#39;s my life and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:08.520" style="s2">I think there&#39;s insights on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.850" end="00:27:10.950" style="s2">and you find that is to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.520" end="00:27:14.490" style="s2">there are larger meaning structures</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.950" end="00:27:17.940" style="s2">structures like those collectives into</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.490" end="00:27:20.730" style="s2">which we can have our sacrifices he made</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.940" end="00:27:22.500" style="s2">me for but we want to safeguard against</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.730" end="00:27:25.950" style="s2">the machine I mean a lot of people end</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.500" end="00:27:28.020" style="s2">up feeling really great in losing</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.950" end="00:27:30.390" style="s2">themselves into something faster than</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.020" end="00:27:32.160" style="s2">themselves and I&#39;m all for that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.390" end="00:27:35.310" style="s2">what are they gonna lose themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.160" end="00:27:37.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s I so I really love the cover</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.310" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">that they did on the book you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.170" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">because it has you see a person we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:46.580" style="s2">see his face we just see we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:49.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.580" end="00:27:52.200" style="s2">yourself by taking care of who you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.500" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">really are who you really are is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.200" end="00:27:56.670" style="s2">world that&#39;s opening by is your</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:28:00.270" style="s2">replacement moment so I think what</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.670" end="00:28:01.950" style="s2">happened is when people in like I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.270" end="00:28:03.870" style="s2">this is sometimes it&#39;s part of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.950" end="00:28:06.090" style="s2">blues rock culture but it&#39;s like I need</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.870" end="00:28:08.010" style="s2">more me time and I&#39;m not giving it up</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.090" end="00:28:11.670" style="s2">focus on me and this kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.010" end="00:28:13.890" style="s2">me isn&#39;t me time I need to go have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.670" end="00:28:17.400" style="s2">know like people pander to me and feel</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.890" end="00:28:20.290" style="s2">like I&#39;m being you really treated in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.400" end="00:28:23.470" style="s2">this kind of like self-indulgent kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.290" end="00:28:26.110" style="s2">that&#39;s been done under the flag of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.470" end="00:28:28.930" style="s2">authenticity yeah you know and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.110" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">trying to cut against that but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.930" end="00:28:32.740" style="s2">like you know we all have to join the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.120" style="s2">military and we&#39;ll be part of the war</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.740" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2">machine or be completely self</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.120" end="00:28:40.570" style="s2">sacrificing I think there is a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:43.960" style="s2">which you find you know your place in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.570" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">the world by contributing to it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.960" end="00:28:48.160" style="s2">to free up the world&#39;s beauty try to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:50.710" style="s2">help other people in their possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:52.840" style="s2">but at no point is that your doing your</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.710" end="00:28:56.260" style="s2">own thing but Nora you just thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.840" end="00:28:58.360" style="s2">within the social machine that you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.260" end="00:29:00.070" style="s2">is assigned in place for you I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.360" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">there is no way I think there is a way</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.070" end="00:29:07.030" style="s2">to to articulate a space that has all</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:09.850" style="s2">the hallmarks of social responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.030" end="00:29:12.220" style="s2">and what we&#39;re going to call your civic</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.850" end="00:29:15.040" style="s2">society and social goodness while also</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.220" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s not tyrannical to the individuals</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:30.690" style="s2">is in this part where you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.460" end="00:29:33.070" style="s2">this thing you say about indebtedness</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.690" end="00:29:36.130" style="s2">more simply a dress is a dutiful</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.070" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">autonomy one&#39;s one liberated by</p>

<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:44.170" style="s2">of and this is this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.710" end="00:29:45.940" style="s2">kind of I&#39;ve heard you talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.170" end="00:29:50.980" style="s2">rides through all your work right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.940" end="00:29:58.600" style="s2">the this this I don&#39;t want say unity but</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.980" end="00:30:02.130" style="s2">this Col relationship right of of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.600" end="00:30:04.480" style="s2">sense of indebtedness that&#39;s right like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.130" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">indebtedness and I remember in your in</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.480" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">your older videos right there&#39;s a dig</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">there&#39;s like this big debate was life a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:13.450" style="s2">curse or was it a blessing basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:17.410" style="s2">right was it a gift right or was it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">it torture YUM and and you always really</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.410" end="00:30:22.510" style="s2">kind of argued for the fete like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:24.820" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s a it&#39;s such a gift yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.510" end="00:30:28.810" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t have even wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.820" end="00:30:30.730" style="s2">right it&#39;s like unwanted all right and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.810" end="00:30:33.280" style="s2">don&#39;t mean just you know in Truman gift</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.730" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">is the same word as Voyager so it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:38.470" style="s2">you needed one be really careful our</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.980" end="00:30:41.350" style="s2">phrasing about the gift is the reference</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.470" end="00:30:42.730" style="s2">to the radical asymmetry well you know I</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.600" end="00:39:49.240" style="s2">character again for the Stoics you were</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.060" end="00:39:52.060" style="s2">born with reasoned and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.240" end="00:39:55.480" style="s2">reason includes the ability to take your</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.060" end="00:39:57.070" style="s2">life the storage really drift away from</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.480" end="00:39:59.590" style="s2">Christianity then Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.070" end="00:40:02.380" style="s2">who&#39;s really against suicide because if</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.590" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">you kill someone and then you could beg</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.380" end="00:40:06.450" style="s2">for forgiveness but if you kill yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:10.060" style="s2">you didn&#39;t have a chance to be forgiving</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.450" end="00:40:13.830" style="s2">Christian advice against suicide is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.060" end="00:40:13.830" style="s2">much against the stoic sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.250" end="00:40:23.530" style="s2">because absolutely are not slavery</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.830" end="00:40:27.400" style="s2">they&#39;re an ancient but if life is so</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.530" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">nasty so just inconsolably bad off</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.400" end="00:40:32.080" style="s2">yourself and you have the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:33.700" style="s2">so and we could go into the details of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.080" end="00:40:34.300" style="s2">his laws against it&#39;s not always that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.700" end="00:40:36.550" style="s2">easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.300" end="00:40:38.440" style="s2">there are ways in which we could have as</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.550" end="00:40:43.690" style="s2">a society don&#39;t better with these</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.440" end="00:40:46.690" style="s2">problems but yeah I mean I do think in</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.690" end="00:40:49.450" style="s2">order to really feel gratitude one has</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.690" end="00:40:53.350" style="s2">to feel life as a kind of gift and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.450" end="00:40:58.150" style="s2">think the issue of gratitude is just</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.350" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">absolutely crucial yeah again it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.150" end="00:41:01.990" style="s2">to say I love it because it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:06.660" style="s2">a birthday cake in a pony</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.990" end="00:41:11.260" style="s2">it&#39;s to say that I&#39;m dazzled by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.660" end="00:41:13.780" style="s2">awesomeness of existence by its majesty</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.260" end="00:41:18.190" style="s2">and its beauty it&#39;s that there is such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.780" end="00:41:21.090" style="s2">thing as music and what do I want as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.190" end="00:41:24.040" style="s2">price for that I mean you you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.090" end="00:41:29.830" style="s2">tasted love you&#39;ve tasted the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.040" end="00:41:31.420" style="s2">amazing most beautiful you think you</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.830" end="00:41:33.790" style="s2">should get all this for free without any</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.420" end="00:41:34.420" style="s2">cost I think that seems like a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.790" end="00:41:38.700" style="s2">fair price</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.420" end="00:41:40.940" style="s2">yeah this is yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.700" end="00:41:44.089" style="s2">absolutely and then it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.940" end="00:41:46.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s very easy to see as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.089" end="00:41:47.810" style="s2">talking about that right how much do I</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.040" end="00:41:49.790" style="s2">want to pay for this right basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.810" end="00:41:51.710" style="s2">you&#39;re basically saying if you just get</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.790" end="00:41:52.460" style="s2">really present and you look at your own</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.710" end="00:41:54.890" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.460" end="00:41:57.500" style="s2">right you were already there like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.890" end="00:41:59.470" style="s2">were given by like generations and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.500" end="00:42:02.150" style="s2">generations and generations right</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.470" end="00:42:04.400" style="s2">accounted for you including all of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.150" end="00:42:07.550" style="s2">like most of your capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.400" end="00:42:10.300" style="s2">literacy to read write to think to talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.550" end="00:42:13.910" style="s2">to speak like almost everything is so</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.300" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">imbued with historical relations all the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.910" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">way down right that and that any of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:24.500" style="s2">stuff is it all right is there is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:28.250" style="s2">inexhaustible mystery like it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.500" end="00:42:31.369" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s infallible so he says better</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.250" end="00:42:33.619" style="s2">to have never been realizes that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.369" end="00:42:36.710" style="s2">a paradox that&#39;s sleeping better is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.619" end="00:42:38.480" style="s2">already assuming the rationality to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.710" end="00:42:40.790" style="s2">the judgment but that&#39;s only what comes</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.480" end="00:42:42.740" style="s2">given existence in life so even the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.790" end="00:42:49.130" style="s2">ability to recognize it is better but</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.740" end="00:42:52.730" style="s2">the whole sense of you know to know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.130" end="00:42:56.810" style="s2">there is such a thing as life to know</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.730" end="00:42:58.849" style="s2">them I don&#39;t know what you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.810" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">hard for me to put a price tag on that</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.849" end="00:43:11.180" style="s2">yeah it just seems like it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.130" end="00:43:14.930" style="s2">banquet of all payments itself you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.180" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a spectacle of justice a hardship I</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.930" end="00:43:20.210" style="s2">don&#39;t think we have to give it this</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">whitewash and this eulogy yeah we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.210" end="00:43:24.859" style="s2">rose-colored glasses whatever expression</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:27.790" style="s2">you use I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.859" end="00:43:30.020" style="s2">going back to this issue gratitude um I</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.790" end="00:43:33.140" style="s2">fear that there are many religious</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.020" end="00:43:35.480" style="s2">people they don&#39;t know how to accept be</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.140" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">granted to them they don&#39;t accept life</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.480" end="00:43:41.030" style="s2">in gratitude because they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:43.069" style="s2">hunted out for an afterlife and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.030" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">the condition that allows them to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.069" end="00:43:46.520" style="s2">them say that yeah life was acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:50.810" style="s2">well then all this hardship is going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.520" end="00:43:53.819" style="s2">be acceptable to there I am you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.810" end="00:43:55.650" style="s2">have I probably seen more antenatal</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.819" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">to some people and I sort of like having</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.650" end="00:43:59.819" style="s2">that that same sort of crazy I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:02.489" style="s2">people who say you know the only way</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.819" end="00:44:04.739" style="s2">that I can accept this world with all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.489" end="00:44:06.779" style="s2">its and justices and hardships is if</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.739" end="00:44:08.729" style="s2">there is some sort of God who&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.779" end="00:44:11.160" style="s2">ensure that justice is served in the end</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.729" end="00:44:12.989" style="s2">and is gonna punish the wicked and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.160" end="00:44:15.059" style="s2">know give treats to the righteous and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.989" end="00:44:17.130" style="s2">when people say that what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.059" end="00:44:19.589" style="s2">saying is I don&#39;t have any gratitude for</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.130" end="00:44:21.569" style="s2">this life until there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.589" end="00:44:23.519" style="s2">beside it and I&#39;m like you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.569" end="00:44:25.949" style="s2">the conditions of just not even being</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.519" end="00:44:28.469" style="s2">able to accept it with gratitude if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.949" end="00:44:30.269" style="s2">need something other than life in order</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.469" end="00:44:33.749" style="s2">to be grateful for life I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.269" end="00:44:35.459" style="s2">you&#39;re grateful for life yes yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.749" end="00:44:40.249" style="s2">like I think it&#39;s I don&#39;t know if I have</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.459" end="00:44:40.249" style="s2">this right but even like my sense about</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.479" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">Christ was like at the end he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.339" end="00:44:54.469" style="s2">basically saying in its absolute worst</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.680" end="00:44:57.509" style="s2">torture can I still say it&#39;s good oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.469" end="00:45:00.359" style="s2">right like that that sense of like all</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.509" end="00:45:03.479" style="s2">the way down right all the way down into</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.359" end="00:45:05.369" style="s2">the worst tragedy great in fact one</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.479" end="00:45:08.039" style="s2">would say one could say that like one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.369" end="00:45:10.619" style="s2">the one of the things about modernism is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.039" end="00:45:12.299" style="s2">the loss of the sense of tragedy I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.619" end="00:45:14.249" style="s2">I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.299" end="00:45:16.799" style="s2">Nietzsche talked about wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.249" end="00:45:19.319" style="s2">restore the sense of the tragedy right</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.799" end="00:45:22.229" style="s2">that&#39;s that sense of just and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.319" end="00:45:25.349" style="s2">something about the tragic it&#39;s so so</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.410" end="00:46:41.520" style="s2">and I think for for some scholars what</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.280" end="00:46:45.060" style="s2">this means is sort of the median thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.520" end="00:46:47.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s that that the spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:47:26.100" end="00:47:30.090" style="s2">of get about even talking about this set</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.560" end="00:47:32.790" style="s2">in the sense of when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.090" end="00:47:36.810" style="s2">about like you get the unfathomable this</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.790" end="00:47:41.460" style="s2">of the ink the like the incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.810" end="00:47:45.540" style="s2">&#39;ti of that there is right in everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.460" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">after that right is is is is downstream</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.540" end="00:47:50.100" style="s2">from this fundamental sense of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:52.080" style="s2">indebtedness to this right and that when</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.100" end="00:47:53.880" style="s2">you look at it right there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.080" end="00:47:57.210" style="s2">about really getting that in your bones</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.880" end="00:47:59.430" style="s2">where you&#39;re not I get this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.210" end="00:48:03.750" style="s2">this is where I&#39;m we start to get into</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.430" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">like what is it to be to be as you say</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.750" end="00:48:10.590" style="s2">the habit of authenticity right I get</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.270" style="s2">this sense of that you know in your part</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.590" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">of what you do in this book is you kind</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.270" end="00:48:16.920" style="s2">of start off with looking at the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:19.800" style="s2">modern conception of of authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.920" end="00:48:21.010" style="s2">being very separate referential as if</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.800" end="00:48:24.010" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.010" end="00:48:27.910" style="s2">then become fulfilled right inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.010" end="00:48:29.560" style="s2">and you&#39;re like well okay so let&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.910" end="00:48:31.360" style="s2">of all we have to look at what is itself</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.560" end="00:48:34.270" style="s2">and then you then you break it down into</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.360" end="00:48:38.290" style="s2">into like four basic vectors right I</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.270" end="00:48:43.120" style="s2">think one was one was embodiment right</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.290" end="00:48:46.660" style="s2">the other one was Senora Senora sness as</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.120" end="00:48:50.530" style="s2">I say that correctly yeah right language</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.660" end="00:48:54.280" style="s2">speech discourse right and the other one</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.530" end="00:48:57.160" style="s2">was um it&#39;s temporal yeah temporality</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.280" end="00:48:58.930" style="s2">Association sociality and that like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.160" end="00:49:00.850" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay look if we work the lip</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.930" end="00:49:03.070" style="s2">we need to look at what itself is first</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.850" end="00:49:05.500" style="s2">of all before we look at can it be</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.070" end="00:49:08.980" style="s2">fulfilled and if that even by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.500" end="00:49:10.690" style="s2">the book I get the sense of like I have</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.980" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">this sense of often and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.690" end="00:49:16.380" style="s2">like true of my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.520" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">authenticity is less and less about a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.380" end="00:49:24.430" style="s2">self reflective orientation right and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:27.970" style="s2">more like this way I&#39;m in I&#39;m though</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.430" end="00:49:29.350" style="s2">it&#39;s something about the way well I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.970" end="00:49:33.610" style="s2">think the use that you actually say this</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.350" end="00:49:37.780" style="s2">it&#39;s the the way I embrace my concerns</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.610" end="00:49:40.870" style="s2">right in others as an embody being right</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.870" end="00:49:48.310" style="s2">right that there&#39;s all it&#39;s the way that</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:24.850" style="s2">there is this sense in which some people</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:26.230" style="s2">they realize that they will die they</p>

<p begin="00:52:49.690" end="00:52:57.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a there so there so you know as for</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.840" end="00:52:59.830" style="s2">Becky would say there&#39;s the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.640" end="00:53:01.540" style="s2">relationship there&#39;s no agent and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.830" end="00:53:03.880" style="s2">an arena it&#39;s the eight they co</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.540" end="00:53:06.760" style="s2">constitute each other you&#39;ve never done</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.880" end="00:53:08.890" style="s2">anything is a response right and so what</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.760" end="00:53:12.220" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is like authenticity is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.890" end="00:53:14.860" style="s2">the way I take up that response right</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.220" end="00:53:17.260" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the content of their</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.860" end="00:53:20.590" style="s2">responsiveness Nestle right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.260" end="00:53:25.750" style="s2">correct quality of the care it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.590" end="00:53:29.260" style="s2">quality of begin yeah as I&#39;m taking care</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.750" end="00:53:31.600" style="s2">of the world I&#39;m doing so not with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.260" end="00:53:35.560" style="s2">neglectful indifference but with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.600" end="00:53:41.580" style="s2">passion that realizes that my presence</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.560" end="00:53:44.050" style="s2">is exactly so that&#39;s that part of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.580" end="00:53:46.780" style="s2">because I think that you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.050" end="00:53:50.590" style="s2">people in when when they have that kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.780" end="00:53:54.460" style="s2">of going with the motions like in depth</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.590" end="00:53:55.930" style="s2">like apathetic indifference right in</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.460" end="00:53:58.660" style="s2">other words I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.930" end="00:54:00.520" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve always done and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.660" end="00:54:02.350" style="s2">that&#39;s what they do and right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.520" end="00:54:07.300" style="s2">that kind of sense of idle talk right</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.350" end="00:54:08.350" style="s2">which I which which you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.300" end="00:54:10.690" style="s2">certain sense it&#39;s easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.350" end="00:54:13.900" style="s2">moralistic about this but my III don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.690" end="00:54:16.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually come to notice like things</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.900" end="00:54:19.180" style="s2">like manners and in idle talk is</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.660" end="00:54:24.040" style="s2">actually the way that the culture keeps</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.180" end="00:54:26.080" style="s2">its foliage in in play right but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.040" end="00:54:28.570" style="s2">there&#39;s the this is what this is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.080" end="00:54:29.590" style="s2">also part of what I think is so</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.570" end="00:54:32.020" style="s2">inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.590" end="00:54:34.180" style="s2">like innately inspiring I would say</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.020" end="00:54:37.090" style="s2">about the notion of authenticity and</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.180" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">scary about it is that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.090" end="00:54:43.150" style="s2">about that very same thing that allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:46.060" style="s2">for the possibility of of responding</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.150" end="00:54:48.360" style="s2">authentically right it&#39;s also the very</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.060" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">thing that allows for inauthenticity</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.360" end="00:54:54.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s a there&#39;s a rule it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:55.470" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s so open right it&#39;s so open</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.040" end="00:54:59.590" style="s2">in some regard that it allows</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.470" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">misconceptions of itself right and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.590" end="00:55:02.280" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:05.650" style="s2">this there is I think that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.280" end="00:55:07.510" style="s2">individual seems to in this embodied way</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.650" end="00:55:09.910" style="s2">to me seems to have I just feel this</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.510" end="00:55:12.130" style="s2">kind of torque where it&#39;s like yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.910" end="00:55:15.460" style="s2">you just let it go</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.130" end="00:55:17.579" style="s2">right and let it be I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.460" end="00:55:20.470" style="s2">environment will supply you with</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.579" end="00:55:21.819" style="s2">interpretations and embodiment and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.470" end="00:55:26.230" style="s2">and that you can just kind of bumble</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.819" end="00:55:27.849" style="s2">along so there is I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.230" end="00:55:29.559" style="s2">asking I&#39;m starting to realize I&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.849" end="00:55:32.530" style="s2">I&#39;m asking is it there does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.559" end="00:55:34.990" style="s2">that there is an ethical moral morality</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.530" end="00:55:49.260" style="s2">in just the way that I take up that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.990" end="00:55:51.640" style="s2">response yeah very much I think it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.260" end="00:55:53.710" style="s2">forces the issue that when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.640" end="00:55:56.140" style="s2">people get back over your life that when</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.710" end="00:55:57.579" style="s2">you were 15 you took someone to prom do</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.140" end="00:56:01.990" style="s2">you think of someone else whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.579" end="00:56:05.010" style="s2">think they&#39;re like well I could have</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.990" end="00:56:09.460" style="s2">done otherwise and they have that sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.010" end="00:56:11.410" style="s2">I think they&#39;re they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.460" end="00:56:14.380" style="s2">register something like look I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.410" end="00:56:16.510" style="s2">agent I make choices I make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.380" end="00:56:20.440" style="s2">and I am to the great but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.510" end="00:56:24.190" style="s2">realize you met they&#39;re coming over in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.440" end="00:56:26.740" style="s2">an inauthentic way the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.190" end="00:56:30.789" style="s2">that was the past and you were there and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.740" end="00:56:34.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what you did and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.789" end="00:56:36.130" style="s2">not to say that they can&#39;t do different</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.059" end="00:56:38.049" style="s2">now or do different in the future but to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.130" end="00:56:39.940" style="s2">pretend that I wasn&#39;t there and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.049" end="00:56:41.410" style="s2">that sort of feature that is the more</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.940" end="00:56:43.869" style="s2">that people are able to convince</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.410" end="00:56:45.789" style="s2">themselves that they&#39;re incidental bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.869" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">players and a word that goes on without</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.789" end="00:56:57.430" style="s2">them and that because they just as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:59.760" style="s2">could have done otherwise this isn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.430" end="00:57:04.869" style="s2">problem stop my responsibility this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.760" end="00:57:07.569" style="s2">someone else&#39;s yeah waiting for someone</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.869" end="00:57:11.589" style="s2">else to save us from ourselves right so</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.569" end="00:57:13.150" style="s2">that call the calling of the response so</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.589" end="00:57:14.050" style="s2">that&#39;s just that&#39;s always that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.150" end="00:57:16.690" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.050" end="00:57:18.580" style="s2">really rich and just that saying right I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.690" end="00:57:20.620" style="s2">know I think here card talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.580" end="00:57:22.450" style="s2">Heidegger talks about that right the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.620" end="00:57:25.240" style="s2">call of conscious or the call of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.450" end="00:57:29.020" style="s2">response in this sense of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.240" end="00:57:31.510" style="s2">the metaphoric sense of listening right</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.020" end="00:57:36.150" style="s2">and I wanted to kind of go into this</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.510" end="00:57:36.150" style="s2">with you a little bit about this role of</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.660" end="00:57:42.430" style="s2">of listening right so in some ways for</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.900" end="00:57:44.290" style="s2">example when you described writing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.430" end="00:57:46.990" style="s2">book right and you were like COD some</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.290" end="00:57:50.640" style="s2">days and you&#39;re talking about with tears</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.990" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">like Thayer said that like you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.640" end="00:57:55.720" style="s2">philosophy these ideas you create them</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t find them right you create</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.720" end="00:58:00.760" style="s2">them and at the same time what I heard</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:02.830" style="s2">you say right is like some days I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.760" end="00:58:05.680" style="s2">fucking could find it in other days I</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.830" end="00:58:07.180" style="s2">couldn&#39;t and then going into despair if</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.680" end="00:58:10.300" style="s2">there was something you were contending</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.180" end="00:58:14.650" style="s2">with though right it&#39;s like right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.300" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a wrestling it in some way this</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.650" end="00:58:20.440" style="s2">sense of heat this this connection</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:23.890" style="s2">between authenticity and genuine</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.440" end="00:58:25.660" style="s2">listening right and genuine hearing</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.890" end="00:58:28.390" style="s2">right I&#39;m thinking about some of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.660" end="00:58:31.480" style="s2">work that you&#39;ve done with around Walter</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.390" end="00:58:34.800" style="s2">all right and and that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.480" end="00:58:38.700" style="s2">about there&#39;s something about when</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.800" end="00:58:42.160" style="s2">historically when we became literate</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.700" end="00:58:47.500" style="s2">right it seems it seems like it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.160" end="00:58:49.120" style="s2">my understanding is that even today with</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.500" end="00:58:52.570" style="s2">illiterate people they have a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.120" end="00:58:54.250" style="s2">difficult time right abstracting out a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.570" end="00:58:59.380" style="s2">biographical self that goes across</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.250" end="00:59:00.730" style="s2">context right right in this yeah and yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.380" end="00:59:02.620" style="s2">I just wondering if you could say</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.730" end="00:59:06.130" style="s2">something about this process about this</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.620" end="00:59:09.040" style="s2">call in any way in on that is that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.130" end="00:59:12.510" style="s2">think there are others as well like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.040" end="00:59:14.770" style="s2">junior dogs the Greeks near a snorting</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.510" end="00:59:17.950" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s a transition that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.770" end="00:59:20.170" style="s2">occurs in the drift from shame cultures</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.950" end="00:59:22.180" style="s2">which tend to be oral versus guilt</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.170" end="00:59:25.960" style="s2">cultures which tend to be literate where</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.180" end="00:59:27.000" style="s2">you know shame is the outward people</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.960" end="00:59:30.360" style="s2">telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.000" end="00:59:33.600" style="s2">to do what you&#39;re doing is you to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.360" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">internalize those others and you command</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.600" end="00:59:38.330" style="s2">yourself not to do what you think others</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.860" style="s2">would change and so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.330" end="00:59:44.910" style="s2">internalization of the others shame it</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.860" end="00:59:49.220" style="s2">becomes built-in and I mean like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.910" end="00:59:52.950" style="s2">guilt in substantial sense is not at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.220" end="00:59:57.030" style="s2">remorse over things that one have done</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.950" end="01:00:02.520" style="s2">it&#39;s as much listening to the voice</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.030" end="01:00:06.420" style="s2">that&#39;s calling me you want to do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.520" end="01:00:08.700" style="s2">you know so whatever you&#39;re you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.420" end="01:00:11.160" style="s2">tempted by some other person you know</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.850" end="01:00:20.730" style="s2">that exercise you know if I do this can</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.570" end="01:00:22.920" style="s2">I just say to myself I just as well</p>

<p begin="01:07:56.989" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">question I&#39;m wondering is my I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.209" end="01:08:03.589" style="s2">naturally my awareness is going is like</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:06.559" style="s2">okay the difference that makes that</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.589" end="01:08:09.529" style="s2">difference right like the difference</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.559" end="01:08:11.569" style="s2">that makes that difference if I whether</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.529" end="01:08:14.299" style="s2">or not I get up to the alarm or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.569" end="01:08:16.190" style="s2">get a V alarm right whether I hit the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.299" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">snooze button or I I</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.190" end="01:08:24.770" style="s2">respond to it as the as the alarm is the</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:27.560" style="s2">the fire alarm right has to do so it</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.770" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">seems to have to do with how deeply both</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.560" end="01:08:34.969" style="s2">the temporality of the future occurs for</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:41.449" style="s2">me right yes right how it occurs for me</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.969" end="01:08:44.150" style="s2">in that that occurrence seems to be part</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.449" end="01:08:46.660" style="s2">of the authentic response like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.150" end="01:08:49.699" style="s2">there&#39;s some way that authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.660" end="01:08:51.859" style="s2">brings forward and has me relate to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.699" end="01:08:52.759" style="s2">to the future in that way and this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.859" end="01:08:55.670" style="s2">what I&#39;m thinking about like</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.759" end="01:08:58.160" style="s2">relationship and community great like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.670" end="01:09:00.140" style="s2">how does that future become alive and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.160" end="01:09:03.259" style="s2">present to me in that way such it occurs</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.140" end="01:09:04.910" style="s2">not just like a snooze button but yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.259" end="01:09:07.000" style="s2">but the fire alarm I think these are</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.910" end="01:09:09.710" style="s2">these are like million-dollar</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.000" end="01:09:12.859" style="s2">existential these are just so wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.710" end="01:09:15.680" style="s2">because I think there is a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.859" end="01:09:17.960" style="s2">popular myth that whitewash is this</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.680" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">situation and they be this bootstrapping</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.960" end="01:09:22.370" style="s2">and I&#39;m not trying to give a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:24.380" style="s2">bootstrapping arguing you know so like</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.370" end="01:09:26.390" style="s2">take something like when some person</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.380" end="01:09:28.190" style="s2">gets hit with unemployment and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.390" end="01:09:30.259" style="s2">suddenly again they lose their job they</p>

<p begin="01:09:30.259" end="01:09:33.770" style="s2">becomes like it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.359" end="01:09:35.420" style="s2">depressing right they don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.770" end="01:09:38.420" style="s2">get out of bed in the morning because</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.420" end="01:09:40.130" style="s2">they&#39;re not sure about the future and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.420" end="01:09:42.259" style="s2">then that becomes like a spiral that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.130" end="01:09:43.880" style="s2">the future starts to close off and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.259" end="01:09:45.680" style="s2">as the future starts it goes off they</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.880" end="01:09:47.839" style="s2">feel like they can&#39;t do anything and use</p>

<p begin="01:14:34.070" end="01:14:41.210" style="s2">right you get out of the track and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.650" end="01:14:43.670" style="s2">realize right that that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.210" end="01:14:45.139" style="s2">front of the pack there&#39;s a limit on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.670" end="01:14:47.599" style="s2">pack and there&#39;s the back of the pack</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.139" end="01:14:50.360" style="s2">they&#39;d always works that way right and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.599" end="01:14:51.739" style="s2">then he&#39;s like the first the first part</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.360" end="01:14:53.329" style="s2">is like you get your coordination down</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.739" end="01:14:55.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s lots of skills and drills</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.329" end="01:14:57.179" style="s2">and a repetition and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.920" end="01:14:58.770" style="s2">and then you get into the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.179" end="01:15:01.140" style="s2">pack and the East is like that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.770" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">you realize that there&#39;s the front of</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.140" end="01:15:04.020" style="s2">the middle pack the middle of the middle</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:06.750" style="s2">back in the back of the mill pack and he</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.020" end="01:15:09.690" style="s2">said like every into the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.750" end="01:15:14.219" style="s2">pack every like threshold he broke</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.690" end="01:15:16.350" style="s2">through essentially was about practice</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.219" end="01:15:17.489" style="s2">and skill building practice and getting</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.350" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">better and better and better and better</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.489" end="01:15:22.199" style="s2">and then he got to the front of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:25.050" style="s2">middle of pack and it was like this kind</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.199" end="01:15:27.179" style="s2">of threshold that he couldn&#39;t there was</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.050" end="01:15:29.550" style="s2">no amount of practicing with his team</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.179" end="01:15:31.290" style="s2">that he could get any farther and so he</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.550" end="01:15:33.330" style="s2">so what he started doing is he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.290" end="01:15:35.010" style="s2">started like hanging out with the people</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.330" end="01:15:36.000" style="s2">in the front of the pack and the front</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.010" end="01:15:37.469" style="s2">of the people open from the pack were</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.000" end="01:15:39.600" style="s2">usually way in front of the pack like</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.469" end="01:15:40.920" style="s2">they were in a different world and so he</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.600" end="01:15:43.140" style="s2">started hanging out with their families</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.920" end="01:15:45.719" style="s2">and he started having conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.140" end="01:15:47.400" style="s2">them going out to lunch and it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.719" end="01:15:50.010" style="s2">interesting because in this in this way</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.400" end="01:15:52.380" style="s2">he started to realize that the people in</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.010" end="01:15:54.780" style="s2">the front of the pack had a completely</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.380" end="01:15:56.460" style="s2">different vocabulary rather than the</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.780" end="01:16:00.270" style="s2">people in the middle of the pack right</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.460" end="01:16:02.219" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting and he the way he</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.270" end="01:16:05.400" style="s2">brought that in is he talks about that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.219" end="01:16:08.460" style="s2">is is he&#39;s highlighting how language</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.400" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">right but I actually think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.460" end="01:16:12.210" style="s2">relationality I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:14.969" style="s2">language cuz that because language is</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.210" end="01:16:18.360" style="s2">always within relate like relationship</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.969" end="01:16:21.090" style="s2">relationship right embedded but we eat</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.360" end="01:16:22.739" style="s2">say like for example when people in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.090" end="01:16:25.230" style="s2">middle of the pack right would talk</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.739" end="01:16:26.429" style="s2">about an inch between the cars they</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.230" end="01:16:28.590" style="s2">would relate to it like an inch between</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.429" end="01:16:30.420" style="s2">the cars but the people up there are</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.590" end="01:16:32.460" style="s2">talk about the inch between the cars in</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.420" end="01:16:35.580" style="s2">there are all these distinctions within</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.460" end="01:16:37.860" style="s2">that inch that are like metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.580" end="01:16:39.770" style="s2">like miles apart all these things that</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.860" end="01:16:42.239" style="s2">you can do that that they their</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.770" end="01:16:44.370" style="s2">vocabulary was it was embedded in their</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.239" end="01:16:46.469" style="s2">vocabulary and he says like that then</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.370" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">that&#39;s when he kind of broke the sound</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.469" end="01:16:51.840" style="s2">barrier a few willing started winning</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:54.000" style="s2">races sure I mean that just I think that</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.840" end="01:16:58.670" style="s2">just makes great sense I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.000" end="01:17:02.900" style="s2">very true you know it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.670" end="01:17:06.510" style="s2">really high performing students they can</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.900" end="01:17:07.930" style="s2">celebrate by autographing one you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.510" end="01:17:11.230" style="s2">those testing</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.930" end="01:17:14.890" style="s2">celebrate autograph one I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.230" end="01:17:17.320" style="s2">in a different mindset of how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.890" end="01:17:19.900" style="s2">thinking about their performance you</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.320" end="01:17:24.700" style="s2">know one of the things about performance</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.900" end="01:17:26.470" style="s2">is that you are always separable from</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.700" end="01:17:27.940" style="s2">your performance because you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.470" end="01:17:30.100" style="s2">been greater than who you are you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.940" end="01:17:31.930" style="s2">always been greeted up past performance</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.100" end="01:17:33.910" style="s2">by the time you get the grade it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.930" end="01:17:35.950" style="s2">already a register who you were rather</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.910" end="01:17:37.420" style="s2">than who you are so like like sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.950" end="01:17:40.920" style="s2">you know student hand in a paper and</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.420" end="01:17:40.920" style="s2">I&#39;ll give them a grade back and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.020" end="01:17:51.640" style="s2">they struggle to read their own response</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.540" end="01:17:53.830" style="s2">aloud in class whatever in there when</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.640" end="01:17:55.510" style="s2">they change and so I think high</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.830" end="01:17:58.390" style="s2">performance people are always looking</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.510" end="01:18:00.520" style="s2">for their chance to be evaluated realize</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.390" end="01:18:02.530" style="s2">that it&#39;s a register of the past and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.520" end="01:18:09.490" style="s2">they take it as a learning activity they</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.530" end="01:18:12.340" style="s2">don&#39;t get in their future directive you</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.490" end="01:18:14.680" style="s2">know you never try to figure out you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.340" end="01:18:16.570" style="s2">know why you got where you&#39;re at you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:19:32.260" end="01:19:37.780" style="s2">from my own experience I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.180" end="01:19:40.450" style="s2">fortunate to have had people in my life</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.780" end="01:19:43.420" style="s2">that have basically taken me under their</p>

<p begin="01:19:56.890" end="01:20:02.170" style="s2">but I know what I&#39;m realizing is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.500" end="01:20:04.090" style="s2">that that I was really fortunate right</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.170" end="01:20:05.740" style="s2">because that&#39;s no longer kind of built</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.090" end="01:20:08.800" style="s2">into the culture this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.740" end="01:20:11.830" style="s2">mentorship and deep relationship where</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.800" end="01:20:14.530" style="s2">somebody really does take on your</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.830" end="01:20:16.720" style="s2">responsibility in a way as if it was</p>

<p begin="01:20:25.270" end="01:20:31.420" style="s2">of you know those habits by which were</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.630" end="01:20:33.250" style="s2">liberated up you know in our autonomy to</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.420" end="01:20:37.330" style="s2">the indebtedness to others I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.250" end="01:20:39.820" style="s2">think the more as you say reflect back</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.330" end="01:20:42.370" style="s2">on my life there were key mentors</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.820" end="01:20:45.100" style="s2">whether they were friends whether they</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.370" end="01:20:47.200" style="s2">were teachers whether they were bosses</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.100" end="01:20:50.620" style="s2">just relatives that there were certain</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.320" end="01:21:17.320" style="s2">doing it in their lives I think when I</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.610" end="01:21:19.720" style="s2">was when I was younger I just saw was in</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.320" end="01:21:21.640" style="s2">the panic of wanting to to make it or</p>

<p begin="01:21:29.560" end="01:21:35.019" style="s2">to do and now my boys are really drifted</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.230" end="01:21:40.539" style="s2">just toward teaching tip toward</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.019" end="01:21:42.159" style="s2">see students thrive in succeed in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.539" end="01:21:44.440" style="s2">and when you&#39;re a teacher and in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:47.829" style="s2">sense of like the mentorship see I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.440" end="01:21:49.960" style="s2">wondering about if we have relationships</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.829" end="01:21:53.320" style="s2">in our lives right if we have communitas</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.960" end="01:21:57.070" style="s2">right like the sense of like the religio</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.320" end="01:22:00.550" style="s2">sense of religion right the community it</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.070" end="01:22:02.650" style="s2">seems like that the that is so huge when</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.550" end="01:22:05.559" style="s2">it comes to being able to hear the call</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.650" end="01:22:09.659" style="s2">because I think that they&#39;re in so many</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.559" end="01:22:12.460" style="s2">different ways I look at my own life</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.659" end="01:22:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s those mentors in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.460" end="01:22:16.239" style="s2">they kind of in some way whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.800" end="01:22:18.460" style="s2">they are new that they were doing it or</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.239" end="01:22:23.519" style="s2">not we&#39;re helping me hear the call of my</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.460" end="01:22:25.780" style="s2">own teacher right in that sense of like</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.519" end="01:22:28.749" style="s2">like we could see they could see</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.780" end="01:22:30.969" style="s2">potential in me right whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.749" end="01:22:32.980" style="s2">they specifically said it or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.969" end="01:22:35.590" style="s2">more like in their enactment about the</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.980" end="01:22:37.329" style="s2">way they were the way they sacked with</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.590" end="01:22:39.130" style="s2">me through the quad at the time that</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.329" end="01:22:42.429" style="s2">they spent with me though the way that</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.130" end="01:22:44.889" style="s2">they were silent with me like the things</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.429" end="01:22:46.630" style="s2">that they told me in confidence that</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.889" end="01:22:49.900" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t tell anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.630" end="01:22:52.480" style="s2">and what that the self in me that that</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.900" end="01:22:55.480" style="s2">called out to keep that confidence right</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.480" end="01:22:59.909" style="s2">in that respect those kinds of deep</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.480" end="01:23:02.400" style="s2">things right I I have this sense in are</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.909" end="01:23:05.110" style="s2">more and more and more and more and more</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.400" end="01:23:10.989" style="s2">that those relationships are becoming</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.110" end="01:23:19.989" style="s2">almost obsolete right concern I just saw</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.989" end="01:23:22.030" style="s2">a video of civility in US and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.989" end="01:23:23.829" style="s2">another world and he was sort of saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.030" end="01:23:30.010" style="s2">that it&#39;s the loss of face to face</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.829" end="01:23:33.969" style="s2">interaction and interacting with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.010" end="01:23:35.349" style="s2">easy to be uncivil and lead to someone</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.969" end="01:23:36.820" style="s2">who&#39;s at a distance and it&#39;s just kind</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.349" end="01:23:39.340" style="s2">of an image an avatar with</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.820" end="01:23:42.340" style="s2">all communications face to face there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.340" end="01:23:44.110" style="s2">more of a demand don&#39;t go back to this</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.340" end="01:23:46.449" style="s2">just sort of this piece you about</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.110" end="01:23:47.900" style="s2">indebtedness and I guess I&#39;m the height</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.449" end="01:23:51.710" style="s2">of your frame maybe I want to</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.900" end="01:23:53.300" style="s2">circle back yeah make this I mean I want</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.710" end="01:23:54.500" style="s2">to sort of safeguard against potential</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.300" end="01:23:58.100" style="s2">misunderstandings that are all different</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.500" end="01:24:00.290" style="s2">listening because I think yeah what I</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.100" end="01:24:03.710" style="s2">would want to be somewhat cautious that</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.290" end="01:24:06.860" style="s2">you know I think for Heidegger the</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.710" end="01:24:09.469" style="s2">beginning of the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.860" end="01:24:11.920" style="s2">authentic self begins with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.469" end="01:24:17.110" style="s2">realization that I am NOT everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.920" end="01:24:19.640" style="s2">that I am me and I&#39;m unique and I</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.110" end="01:24:22.760" style="s2">uniquely held in the thrill of history</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.640" end="01:24:25.760" style="s2">and that although I came to a</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.760" end="01:24:29.300" style="s2">self-awareness through this anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.760" end="01:24:31.699" style="s2">structure of language and of culture by</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.300" end="01:24:34.460" style="s2">the time I found myself and realized</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.699" end="01:24:36.980" style="s2">that I would die I realized that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.460" end="01:24:43.130" style="s2">everyone else that I&#39;m uniquely me and</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.980" end="01:24:48.530" style="s2">that claiming my life in a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.130" end="01:24:51.080" style="s2">so stuff like I can imagine a culture of</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.530" end="01:24:53.510" style="s2">high performance people someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.080" end="01:24:58.190" style="s2">born into it who&#39;s never really known</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.510" end="01:25:01.370" style="s2">any other than that I don&#39;t follow in</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.190" end="01:25:04.790" style="s2">our cultural protocols are lost in da</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.370" end="01:25:08.480" style="s2">smog where I think there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.790" end="01:25:12.190" style="s2">something like this relief that where</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.480" end="01:25:16.100" style="s2">the individual gets broken off from</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.190" end="01:25:22.850" style="s2">others and is thrown back upon him or</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.100" end="01:25:28.130" style="s2">herself and you know the questions are</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.850" end="01:25:30.489" style="s2">about I think Heidegger would be very</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.130" end="01:25:32.270" style="s2">reluctant to talk about contemporary</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.489" end="01:25:34.969" style="s2">capitalist busyness</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.270" end="01:25:37.880" style="s2">yeah sort of high performance so I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.969" end="01:25:45.050" style="s2">he&#39;d be like who sit and read a poem in</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.880" end="01:25:48.140" style="s2">it under a tree and really engage in you</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.050" end="01:25:49.190" style="s2">know being authentic isn&#39;t just self</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.140" end="01:25:54.489" style="s2">mastery</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.190" end="01:25:56.989" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just something a command over</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.489" end="01:25:59.690" style="s2">once like the way one wants but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.989" end="01:26:03.620" style="s2">it&#39;s to actually go you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.690" end="01:26:06.020" style="s2">this is you are there&#39;s never been</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.100" end="01:26:40.990" style="s2">about what what is the point of being</p>

<p begin="01:27:25.190" end="01:27:29.960" style="s2">sense I just it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.280" end="01:27:32.510" style="s2">some level this is this is actually an</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.960" end="01:27:36.470" style="s2">example of this on some level I feel</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.510" end="01:27:40.220" style="s2">like my work has been both this</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.470" end="01:27:41.780" style="s2">discovery but also this founding of</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.220" end="01:27:44.480" style="s2">something this creation of something</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.780" end="01:27:48.220" style="s2">right it&#39;s been so mutual like it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="01:27:49.240" end="01:27:54.620" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s been a real ride I</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.350" end="01:27:58.580" style="s2">just I&#39;m just I continually feel like</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.620" end="01:27:59.990" style="s2">I&#39;m on one level I act as if I know</p>

<p begin="01:27:59.990" end="01:28:04.730" style="s2">right and moving towards but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.440" end="01:28:07.220" style="s2">experience myself when I think about it</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.730" end="01:28:13.190" style="s2">is discovering what I&#39;m doing at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.220" end="01:28:16.850" style="s2">same time it discloses both</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.100" end="01:29:51.949" style="s2">there&#39;s this way in which it seems to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.170" end="01:29:55.040" style="s2">get into into this both the tragedy and</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.949" end="01:29:56.120" style="s2">the beauty right see on one level but</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.040" end="01:29:58.520" style="s2">like when you&#39;re talking about it I</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.120" end="01:30:02.090" style="s2">really relate to that being at a teacher</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.520" end="01:30:03.890" style="s2">role myself there&#39;s often times I get</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.090" end="01:30:06.800" style="s2">the sense that those kind of that kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.890" end="01:30:08.719" style="s2">of thinks that kind of praise and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.800" end="01:30:13.190" style="s2">interesting what I actually experience</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.719" end="01:30:17.120" style="s2">is this is this sense of I feel so</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.190" end="01:30:19.070" style="s2">embedded and loved by them but for</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.120" end="01:30:21.590" style="s2">precisely that because it just seems</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.070" end="01:30:23.090" style="s2">like it&#39;s I&#39;m so aware of that very</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.590" end="01:30:25.400" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re talking about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.090" end="01:30:26.950" style="s2">nothing like giving your heart right</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.400" end="01:30:28.690" style="s2">into a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.950" end="01:30:30.670" style="s2">or teaching or what you care about you</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.690" end="01:30:32.470" style="s2">know you you do this because you love</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.670" end="01:30:33.970" style="s2">this like anybody watching this it just</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.470" end="01:30:34.840" style="s2">tells like is you&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.970" end="01:30:36.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.840" end="01:30:38.350" style="s2">like you&#39;ll talk about this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.280" end="01:30:41.080" style="s2">anywhere like almost any time because</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.350" end="01:30:42.610" style="s2">it&#39;s you love it you&#39;re overflowing with</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.080" end="01:30:53.950" style="s2">yourself with this which I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.610" end="01:31:03.010" style="s2">which is just such a manga and I just</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.950" end="01:31:05.080" style="s2">felt like about it but I did that the</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.010" end="01:31:08.770" style="s2">sense of like wow I had a super mentor</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.080" end="01:31:11.680" style="s2">really gave me a leg over my class and</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.770" end="01:31:13.660" style="s2">then it was like you know realizing</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.680" end="01:31:38.050" style="s2">there are other people they had class</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.660" end="01:31:39.490" style="s2">with and it&#39;s to recognize how much well</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.050" end="01:31:44.470" style="s2">as you&#39;re describing that I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.490" end="01:31:47.200" style="s2">how it&#39;s how it&#39;s showing up in me like</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.470" end="01:31:49.210" style="s2">you you&#39;re both disclosed in that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.200" end="01:31:53.350" style="s2">both mutually disclosed in that event</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.210" end="01:31:57.070" style="s2">right of you like so much he&#39;s given so</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.350" end="01:32:00.490" style="s2">much to you but it also you&#39;re disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.070" end="01:32:02.710" style="s2">and having gotten it right they both</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.490" end="01:32:05.110" style="s2">wealthier images are really strong</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.710" end="01:32:07.720" style="s2">mutually disclosed there and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.110" end="01:32:10.240" style="s2">thing that I think starts to become</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.720" end="01:32:13.360" style="s2">possible and authentic discourse in</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.240" end="01:32:15.070" style="s2">conversation in relationship right which</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.360" end="01:32:16.480" style="s2">is oftentimes in it I want a really</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.070" end="01:32:20.860" style="s2">highlighting this really bugs me</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.480" end="01:32:24.130" style="s2">especially in the in California but and</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.860" end="01:32:26.890" style="s2">I and I and John were vacant I have been</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.130" end="01:32:28.960" style="s2">talking a lot about this and and Chris</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.890" end="01:32:31.390" style="s2">and a lot of the a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.960" end="01:32:33.340" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been having conversations and</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.390" end="01:32:37.120" style="s2">videoing them about this this sense of</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.340" end="01:32:40.929" style="s2">restoring the ancient art of philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.120" end="01:32:43.989" style="s2">ah right and and in seeing that</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.929" end="01:32:45.909" style="s2">not not philosophy in the academic sense</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.989" end="01:32:48.250" style="s2">right not in terms of propositions it</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.909" end="01:32:51.969" style="s2">stuff like that but like philosophy a--</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.250" end="01:32:54.370" style="s2">in the in the enacted sense right the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.969" end="01:32:57.280" style="s2">authentic discourse right and in</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.370" end="01:32:59.140" style="s2">dialectic you think about like dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.280" end="01:33:01.120" style="s2">being kind of the logs or the</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.140" end="01:33:03.429" style="s2">propositions that you bring and then you</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.120" end="01:33:05.800" style="s2">start to go he&#39;s they start to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.429" end="01:33:08.770" style="s2">and then it lights the logo slights</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.800" end="01:33:10.210" style="s2">right into dialo goes where you start to</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.770" end="01:33:11.260" style="s2">like think things that you never would</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.210" end="01:33:14.110" style="s2">have thought otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.260" end="01:33:16.510" style="s2">right and then you start to in knowing i</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.110" end="01:33:20.050" style="s2">cannot know you without being known by</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.510" end="01:33:21.790" style="s2">you and i cannot be known by like i</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.050" end="01:33:24.929" style="s2">cannot know you with by being changed by</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.790" end="01:33:30.190" style="s2">what by knowing you but that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.929" end="01:33:33.610" style="s2">that sense of restoring what has been</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.190" end="01:33:35.140" style="s2">for me i&#39;m really liking it in the in</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.610" end="01:33:37.210" style="s2">this last year or so having these</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.140" end="01:33:40.060" style="s2">conversations with people like you and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.210" end="01:33:42.100" style="s2">and and this is what I really deeply</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.060" end="01:33:44.650" style="s2">appreciate the internet right for this</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.100" end="01:33:47.440" style="s2">and this is at least for me it&#39;s allowed</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.650" end="01:33:49.690" style="s2">me to come into contact with people cuz</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.440" end="01:33:51.640" style="s2">I I was basically reading all this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.690" end="01:33:53.110" style="s2">on my own I&#39;d never really gone to</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.640" end="01:33:55.630" style="s2">school for this kind of thing and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.110" end="01:33:57.820" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite even know why but kind of</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.630" end="01:33:59.140" style="s2">working it out and then actually being</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.820" end="01:34:01.510" style="s2">able to talk to people that have read</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.140" end="01:34:04.210" style="s2">the same books and like kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.510" end="01:34:05.890" style="s2">get it but what but we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.210" end="01:34:09.070" style="s2">this kind of comes back to authentic</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.890" end="01:34:13.840" style="s2">discourse which is you know in John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.070" end="01:34:17.050" style="s2">John is a cognitive cognitive scientist</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.840" end="01:34:19.840" style="s2">in a philosopher at Toronto and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.050" end="01:34:24.040" style="s2">been kind of going into like embedding</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.840" end="01:34:25.600" style="s2">himself in these different like these</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.040" end="01:34:27.909" style="s2">different responses to what he calls the</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.600" end="01:34:31.179" style="s2">meeting crisis right which is things</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.909" end="01:34:32.560" style="s2">like the authentic community embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.179" end="01:34:36.360" style="s2">community the different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.560" end="01:34:38.620" style="s2">practices right that in some way as as</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.360" end="01:34:41.290" style="s2">Christianity right it&#39;s things become</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.620" end="01:34:43.840" style="s2">more secular how were people like</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.290" end="01:34:45.880" style="s2">finding significance in meaning in it in</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.840" end="01:34:49.409" style="s2">it in some kind of conscious way and</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.880" end="01:34:51.760" style="s2">what annex he says is like he says that</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.409" end="01:34:54.250" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s missing for him</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.760" end="01:34:57.820" style="s2">is this ancient Socratic sense</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.250" end="01:34:59.650" style="s2">of philosophical dialogue in that he</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.820" end="01:35:00.910" style="s2">like hit the world water we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.650" end="01:35:04.300" style="s2">talking about I really have a tendency</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.910" end="01:35:09.700" style="s2">to agree with them here is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.300" end="01:35:13.030" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not like it would be</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.700" end="01:35:15.100" style="s2">nice if it were there but if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.030" end="01:35:17.470" style="s2">there right if people don&#39;t aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.100" end="01:35:20.620" style="s2">aren&#39;t kind of engaging in conversations</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.470" end="01:35:22.750" style="s2">that actually like reveal the</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.620" end="01:35:24.940" style="s2">ontological ground that they&#39;re standing</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.750" end="01:35:29.140" style="s2">on which it becomes possible in</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.940" end="01:35:34.420" style="s2">conversations right that if that if that</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.140" end="01:35:36.790" style="s2">sense of philosophy of dialo goes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.420" end="01:35:38.710" style="s2">there it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not one of</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.790" end="01:35:40.060" style="s2">those things where you can either have</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.710" end="01:35:41.710" style="s2">the conversation or not have the</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.060" end="01:35:45.100" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s not like you get to</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.710" end="01:35:47.110" style="s2">just kind of go to a to emit like to the</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.100" end="01:35:49.240" style="s2">you know to pick and choose things that</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.110" end="01:35:52.750" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the being of our being</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.240" end="01:35:55.630" style="s2">right and that if it&#39;s not there it may</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.750" end="01:35:57.450" style="s2">not be a full response right so what</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.630" end="01:36:00.520" style="s2">he&#39;s calling the meeting crisis right</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.450" end="01:36:03.610" style="s2">and I&#39;m just curious about like just for</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.520" end="01:36:05.820" style="s2">for you you&#39;re like just your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.610" end="01:36:07.740" style="s2">about that like you like the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.820" end="01:36:09.720" style="s2">relationship of your work of</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.740" end="01:36:12.400" style="s2">relationships right of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.720" end="01:36:15.250" style="s2">conversations of just one is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.400" end="01:36:18.550" style="s2">like this right ones where like your</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.250" end="01:36:23.560" style="s2">experience on YouTube and all that takes</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.550" end="01:36:26.830" style="s2">is there a necessity there I think when</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.560" end="01:36:28.900" style="s2">I first got on YouTube it was pretty</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.830" end="01:36:30.760" style="s2">refreshing basically echoing what you</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.900" end="01:36:33.820" style="s2">said that you know I found so many</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.760" end="01:36:35.740" style="s2">people and it almost felt as if like as</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.820" end="01:36:37.870" style="s2">if it were the ancient world and</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.740" end="01:36:40.390" style="s2">philosophy were like building itself</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.870" end="01:36:44.530" style="s2">again from the ground up of people who</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.390" end="01:36:47.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t trained into the already like</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.530" end="01:36:49.410" style="s2">blind alley ways that they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.200" end="01:36:51.730" style="s2">come into if they would have had</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.410" end="01:36:54.430" style="s2">training in philosophy but it was the</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.730" end="01:36:59.740" style="s2">sort of raw just from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.430" end="01:37:01.540" style="s2">people just philosophizing trying to</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.740" end="01:37:05.290" style="s2">figure stuff out and that was so</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.540" end="01:37:07.210" style="s2">refreshing but that said you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.290" end="01:37:07.990" style="s2">decade that I was on the tubes and I</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.210" end="01:37:13.390" style="s2">first started</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.990" end="01:37:17.830" style="s2">just the proof the rest ility the trolls</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.390" end="01:37:20.560" style="s2">the know that the cross message is a</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.830" end="01:37:24.280" style="s2">certain point and a point I just prefer</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.560" end="01:37:25.780" style="s2">the classroom I prefer you know places</p>

<p begin="01:37:36.790" end="01:37:41.140" style="s2">like the scientists versus the atheist</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.890" end="01:37:43.000" style="s2">kind of stuff and you know I never</p>

<p begin="01:38:14.080" end="01:38:18.610" style="s2">science it&#39;s probably not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.720" end="01:38:21.100" style="s2">that&#39;s worth you know look too much</p>

<p begin="01:39:35.190" end="01:39:47.640" style="s2">it deserves our in reverence and I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.580" end="01:39:51.260" style="s2">there is just you know the mating of a</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.640" end="01:39:54.200" style="s2">rabbit tied onto the mammalian brain and</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.260" end="01:39:57.030" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.200" end="01:40:00.930" style="s2">actual compassion you&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.030" end="01:40:02.820" style="s2">music and just had tears all out of your</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.300" end="01:40:20.760" style="s2">light well that&#39;s a kind of love that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.000" end="01:40:22.020" style="s2">so different than chasing down somebody</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.760" end="01:40:25.170" style="s2">who you&#39;re gonna try to have sex with</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.020" end="01:40:27.030" style="s2">nothing completely unrelated but I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.170" end="01:40:29.910" style="s2">many people have left humanity</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.030" end="01:40:32.400" style="s2">throughout history they have felt the</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.910" end="01:40:34.830" style="s2">suffering and the tragedy of life and</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.400" end="01:40:37.410" style="s2">they have tears just put out of their</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.830" end="01:40:43.560" style="s2">eyes going I don&#39;t know how to make it</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.410" end="01:40:46.140" style="s2">right and they feel right that deep yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.560" end="01:40:49.230" style="s2">that deep sense of participation right</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.140" end="01:40:51.990" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s one of the like like</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.230" end="01:40:54.570" style="s2">knowing via participatory like that</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.990" end="01:40:57.420" style="s2">sense of like the the real involvement</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.570" end="01:40:59.310" style="s2">with the earth right and so just as we</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.420" end="01:41:01.140" style="s2">we start to come to a completion here</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.310" end="01:41:03.000" style="s2">one of the things that you start with is</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.140" end="01:41:05.670" style="s2">it through the whole book and it is just</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.000" end="01:41:10.980" style="s2">precisely that the earth right the sense</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.670" end="01:41:12.840" style="s2">of the sense of and for me it you UK it</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.980" end="01:41:15.990" style="s2">kept ground you all oh you always kind</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.840" end="01:41:19.050" style="s2">of grounded this sense of what you call</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.990" end="01:41:23.910" style="s2">the Earth&#39;s internal self negations</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.050" end="01:41:28.820" style="s2">right right open like in its in some</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.910" end="01:41:31.530" style="s2">sense we are the the Earth&#39;s project of</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.820" end="01:41:32.880" style="s2">basically decompressing the earth</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.530" end="01:41:35.970" style="s2">decompress</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.880" end="01:41:36.720" style="s2">right that&#39;s right worlds through our</p>

<p begin="01:41:40.770" end="01:41:47.070" style="s2">issue earth a lot of times it had to do</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.220" end="01:41:49.560" style="s2">with me I was trying to critique an</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.070" end="01:41:51.630" style="s2">accountant cut against or counter in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.560" end="01:41:53.130" style="s2">spirit through people have like when</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.630" end="01:41:55.500" style="s2">they want to get it what they call my</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.130" end="01:41:57.420" style="s2">independent reality is you only get what</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.500" end="01:41:59.040" style="s2">is mine independent reality like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.420" end="01:42:01.280" style="s2">come at it that way you&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.040" end="01:42:04.800" style="s2">get in this sort of deep current kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.280" end="01:42:07.590" style="s2">quagmire of skepticism and instead move</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.800" end="01:42:13.830" style="s2">toward the phenomena of dreams you want</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.590" end="01:42:16.980" style="s2">to get what is earth as Earth no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.830" end="01:42:19.740" style="s2">imagine the earth with the people on it</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.980" end="01:42:22.200" style="s2">but everyone&#39;s really asleep that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.740" end="01:42:24.270" style="s2">I mean by earth as Earth it&#39;s a state of</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.200" end="01:42:27.990" style="s2">dreamless sleep and when you wake up</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.270" end="01:42:32.220" style="s2">that&#39;s Earth negating its non-existence</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.990" end="01:42:35.010" style="s2">it&#39;s beating the suffocation of Earth is</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.220" end="01:42:37.620" style="s2">waking up and that&#39;s when that duality</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.010" end="01:42:41.220" style="s2">occurs of I&#39;m over here in the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.620" end="01:42:43.440" style="s2">over there there&#39;s really this single</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.220" end="01:42:46.050" style="s2">event of release pending appropriation</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.440" end="01:42:48.750" style="s2">which has tutorials the world over here</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.050" end="01:42:51.120" style="s2">in me as explore life yeah a battle</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.750" end="01:42:52.740" style="s2">situation I mean now we might say well</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.120" end="01:42:54.960" style="s2">the closest I can get to being in a</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.740" end="01:42:56.610" style="s2">situation lessness is something like</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.960" end="01:42:58.640" style="s2">dreamless sleep well then we say well</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.610" end="01:43:02.520" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s awake is aware of in this</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.640" end="01:43:04.920" style="s2">place this time yes fair enough but I</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.520" end="01:43:06.420" style="s2">think read the book where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.920" end="01:43:12.000" style="s2">following the logic I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.420" end="01:43:16.560" style="s2">what I mean oh yeah is a there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.000" end="01:43:19.890" style="s2">thick density of no distances or gaps no</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.560" end="01:43:21.750" style="s2">lapses of time in those moments of</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.890" end="01:43:23.490" style="s2">dreamless sleep and I sometimes think</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.750" end="01:43:26.580" style="s2">like if you want to get what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.490" end="01:43:30.660" style="s2">the world like the reality bonds like to</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.580" end="01:43:33.450" style="s2">asleep I think awakeness and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.660" end="01:43:36.540" style="s2">now dealing with that world of concerns</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.450" end="01:43:40.920" style="s2">that you&#39;ll take to be reality what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.540" end="01:43:45.300" style="s2">just one portion those gaps relapses</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.920" end="01:43:46.930" style="s2">where I not so it&#39;s like every in that</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.300" end="01:43:49.240" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.930" end="01:43:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s just so and there&#39;s one of the ways</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.240" end="01:43:54.810" style="s2">I just appreciated how like also in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.000" end="01:43:58.450" style="s2">book you&#39;re taking on two basic you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.810" end="01:44:00.100" style="s2">pulls of discourse right about this of</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.450" end="01:44:03.780" style="s2">like you have the social constructionist</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.100" end="01:44:07.210" style="s2">that right and then you have like the</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.780" end="01:44:08.730" style="s2">like that like the naive realists if we</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.210" end="01:44:12.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if we call it that right</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.730" end="01:44:14.950" style="s2">and and you&#39;re like and you put you you</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.340" end="01:44:18.490" style="s2">pull out right where they were really on</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.950" end="01:44:20.350" style="s2">but you also pull out their mistake what</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.490" end="01:44:22.510" style="s2">their mistakes and what they missed in</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.350" end="01:44:25.120" style="s2">that right and how that goes and it in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.510" end="01:44:27.340" style="s2">grounds like that really grounds it in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.120" end="01:44:30.490" style="s2">very in a very visceral way and I</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.340" end="01:44:32.860" style="s2">appreciate that&#39;s I think it is trying</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.490" end="01:44:35.080" style="s2">to navigate between an overly subjective</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.860" end="01:44:38.410" style="s2">kind of social constructionism and an</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.080" end="01:44:40.030" style="s2">overly reified naturalism and what you</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.410" end="01:44:42.400" style="s2">do is you need to appeal to a</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.030" end="01:44:43.930" style="s2">phenomenological Constitution once you</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.400" end="01:44:47.140" style="s2">really get at the phenomenology of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.930" end="01:44:51.570" style="s2">body it becomes apparent that sociality</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.140" end="01:44:55.120" style="s2">is already phenomenologically so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.570" end="01:44:56.680" style="s2">it&#39;s our body is called socially</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.120" end="01:44:59.290" style="s2">constructed now we could do that we</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.680" end="01:45:01.990" style="s2">could talk about those senses about the</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.290" end="01:45:05.680" style="s2">ablest bodies and more or less ablest</p>

<p begin="01:45:05.680" end="01:45:08.650" style="s2">the social constructionist movement was</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.150" end="01:45:10.780" style="s2">huge when I was in school back in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.650" end="01:45:15.850" style="s2">80s they were talking about everything</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.780" end="01:45:19.270" style="s2">being social destruction certain points</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.850" end="01:45:21.820" style="s2">yeah totally totally yeah that sense of</p>

<p begin="01:45:21.820" end="01:45:27.310" style="s2">know I wear with this it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.450" end="01:45:30.310" style="s2">like that the postmodern hyper</p>

<p begin="01:45:35.110" end="01:45:40.510" style="s2">right and then they kind of contradicted</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.120" end="01:45:44.350" style="s2">themselves because that well you could</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.510" end="01:45:46.690" style="s2">have any that&#39;s the nature it&#39;s like so</p>

<p begin="01:45:48.790" end="01:45:53.830" style="s2">well yeah that that is possible right</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.400" end="01:45:56.860" style="s2">but actually is it though because I</p>

<p begin="01:46:58.380" end="01:47:07.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a dialogue between us and right</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.789" end="01:47:10.679" style="s2">totally and incomplete in just starting</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.599" end="01:47:13.360" style="s2">to complete this this this this this one</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.679" end="01:47:14.889" style="s2">you know the one of the things I&#39;m you</p>

<p begin="01:47:18.610" end="01:47:23.709" style="s2">we&#39;re reading the dialogue as the the</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.820" end="01:47:25.959" style="s2">Platonic dialogues and I think the thing</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.709" end="01:47:28.479" style="s2">I&#39;m really appreciating about it is this</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.959" end="01:47:31.059" style="s2">sense where there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.479" end="01:47:33.550" style="s2">paradox always in it where Socrates is</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.059" end="01:47:37.719" style="s2">coming from because there&#39;s this way in</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.550" end="01:47:39.670" style="s2">which like you know you go you you go in</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.719" end="01:47:42.760" style="s2">these dialogues and it&#39;ll present some</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.670" end="01:47:44.739" style="s2">proposition and then like you never get</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.760" end="01:47:46.979" style="s2">the thing if the thing just falls apart</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.739" end="01:47:49.809" style="s2">right or it never gets quite answered</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.979" end="01:47:52.150" style="s2">but there&#39;s this way in and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.809" end="01:47:53.590" style="s2">frustrating and repetitive and all of</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.150" end="01:47:55.209" style="s2">these kinds of they go on this right and</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.590" end="01:47:58.030" style="s2">then at the end it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.209" end="01:48:01.389" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense where like no one</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.030" end="01:48:03.099" style="s2">answered the question right even</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.389" end="01:48:04.809" style="s2">Socrates can&#39;t answer the question but</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.099" end="01:48:08.110" style="s2">they say something like my but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.809" end="01:48:11.019" style="s2">seeing clearer right I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.110" end="01:48:12.849" style="s2">I want to send my kids to spend more</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.019" end="01:48:15.460" style="s2">time with Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.849" end="01:48:17.170" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality of love I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.460" end="01:48:19.360" style="s2">what I&#39;m appreciating is this that you</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.170" end="01:48:22.030" style="s2">start to circle around the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.360" end="01:48:25.239" style="s2">actually starts to reveal that which you</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.030" end="01:48:28.300" style="s2">can&#39;t put into words right but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.239" end="01:48:30.070" style="s2">present in some way right it&#39;s present</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.300" end="01:48:32.770" style="s2">in some way that allows you to be able</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.070" end="01:48:37.480" style="s2">to respond more fully right with more</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.770" end="01:48:38.920" style="s2">more gratitude and I I just have been</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.480" end="01:48:41.590" style="s2">appreciating this in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.920" end="01:48:44.790" style="s2">and like your ideas give me that sense</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.590" end="01:48:47.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m left with with some</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.790" end="01:48:51.179" style="s2">propositional truth I&#39;m more left with</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.320" end="01:48:55.210" style="s2">in getting it things are more acutely</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.179" end="01:49:00.460" style="s2">mysterious in a way that has me more</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.210" end="01:49:10.599" style="s2">want to look in models there was a time</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.460" end="01:49:13.630" style="s2">of stories to be able to talk that come</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.599" end="01:49:15.460" style="s2">precipitate the kinds of fairness to the</p>

<p begin="01:49:18.340" end="01:49:24.190" style="s2">the process right versus the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.329" end="01:49:25.780" style="s2">like this like that sense of what I just</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.190" end="01:49:27.130" style="s2">appreciated where were you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.780" end="01:49:29.380" style="s2">about where YouTube kind of devolved</p>

<p begin="01:49:37.780" end="01:49:42.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a real good faith in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.480" end="01:49:43.840" style="s2">that&#39;s calling it forward is that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:49:43.840" end="01:49:49.060" style="s2">getting closer to something and to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.989" end="01:49:51.190" style="s2">degree that what my understanding allows</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.060" end="01:49:53.560" style="s2">me to get closer to the mystery of that</p>
