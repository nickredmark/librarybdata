<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">yeah so what we were talking about just</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.440" end="00:00:13.110" style="s2">before we started recording was just</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">notion that the c19 is implicating</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.110" end="00:00:18.060" style="s2">perhaps all of the meta-crisis certainly</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:19.350" style="s2">from my point of view since I spent most</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.060" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">of my time looking at it from the point</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:24.180" style="s2">of view of the systemic side of it you</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:25.439" style="s2">know I can say with confidence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.180" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">implicating all the different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.439" end="00:00:32.160" style="s2">the systemic side I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">enacting I mean Chris and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">about this Chris master Pietro Anaya</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">it&#39;s also sort of triggering aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">the meaning crisis in powerful ways for</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">people to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">yo I&#39;m interested in learning in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.829" end="00:00:45.210" style="s2">conversation what&#39;s happening like how</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">the how that shadows up and even what</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.210" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">the flow back back through is because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s crucial to grasp that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:53.280" style="s2">funny I do actually keep seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">right and left hemispheres I don&#39;t hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.280" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">that&#39;s useful so what we had talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">about was I&#39;m right now doing work on</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">trying to put together or formulate a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:05.000" style="s2">form of decentralized collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.409" style="s2">intelligence distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.000" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">appropriate to the scope and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.409" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">pace of this particular phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">yeah I think keeping both of those in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">mind is important scope and poise yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">yeah so to kind of our are not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">recapitulate but to capitulate what what</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:29.689" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing on my end is a first order is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">that there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.689" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">systems that are clearly implicated in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:40.850" style="s2">each other so for example the primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">system in c19 is obviously at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.850" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">medical level a specific organism that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">has specific characteristics in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">relationships with the human organism</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:54.060" style="s2">and then of course it has its own</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">characteristics interior to itself so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.060" end="00:01:58.049" style="s2">what what is mutation we might look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">what it&#39;s a molecular structure is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.049" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">gives rise to the key characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">how long it stays viable on surface all</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">that stuff right you got that at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">concrete level and you have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">relationship between the virus and any</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">human being and when you when you look</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">that particular dynamic what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:22.349" style="s2">a cloud of possibilities that that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:26.940" style="s2">different weightings sure though you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.349" end="00:02:27.659" style="s2">have increasing data coming in so right</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.940" end="00:02:29.459" style="s2">now we&#39;re net we&#39;re in a high</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.659" end="00:02:31.190" style="s2">uncertainty phase much less than we were</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.459" end="00:02:34.769" style="s2">a month ago but still high uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.190" end="00:02:36.510" style="s2">around there&#39;s terms that have now</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.769" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">become commonplace things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.510" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">the infection rate or the doubling rate</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">or the r0 you know and mortality or you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">know case implications and impacts on</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">different characteristics the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:53.549" style="s2">relationship between the virus and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">different human characteristic and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.549" end="00:02:57.629" style="s2">we have already begun the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:02:59.879" style="s2">looking at from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.629" end="00:03:03.989" style="s2">systemic impacts and so it&#39;s now pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.879" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">pretty evident sorry I&#39;m a backup so</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.989" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">going forward from this point forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:12.569" style="s2">obviously we&#39;re walking in a place of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">epistemological uncertainty so what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.569" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">will tend to do is I will take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">particular set of hypotheses which looks</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.620" end="00:03:23.959" style="s2">to visual to me looks like a tunnel and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:26.609" style="s2">it has a certain diameter based upon its</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.959" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">probability and I&#39;ll walk down that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.609" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">hypothesis as if that is reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">but but then I can back all the way back</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">out and shift and walk down another one</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:35.700" style="s2">sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:37.680" style="s2">and of course you can always do a depth</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.700" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">first versus breadth first so once one</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.680" end="00:03:40.709" style="s2">purchase might be to start mapping out a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:41.639" style="s2">whole bunch of different tunnels so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.709" end="00:03:43.319" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a sense of what the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.639" end="00:03:45.299" style="s2">looks like another approaches to drill</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.319" end="00:03:48.450" style="s2">down a baton so you get a sense of how</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.299" end="00:03:51.660" style="s2">your thought process needs to inquire</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.450" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">into how you&#39;re in crew has to it has to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.660" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">evolve as you actually discover more</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:57.780" style="s2">detail and nuance and run particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:59.099" style="s2">tunnel so one of the characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.780" end="00:04:00.209" style="s2">that I think started getting a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.099" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.209" end="00:04:04.940" style="s2">it started showing that more broadly in</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:09.349" style="s2">the collective sense making no last week</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.940" end="00:04:15.979" style="s2">was the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.349" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">robustness of a medical system and both</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.979" end="00:04:26.490" style="s2">the virality and impact of the virus so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:29.430" style="s2">for example in Korea</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.490" end="00:04:32.699" style="s2">where the medical system has a very high</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:34.940" style="s2">robustness around testing there they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.699" end="00:04:39.380" style="s2">and are choosing to test significantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.940" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">this is tending to show up as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.380" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">reduction in the viral viral expansion</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:46.919" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been a very good job of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:48.900" style="s2">identifying who in fact is carrying what</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.919" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">at what level and therefore able to do a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.900" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">better job of a more precise and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:57.060" style="s2">effective quarantine this it appears to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">the kids equally if you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.060" end="00:05:01.860" style="s2">what happened in the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">the impact of the mortality rates as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.860" end="00:05:10.440" style="s2">proxy for impact between our array and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">other Chinese regions the overwhelm of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.440" end="00:05:14.099" style="s2">the medical system the overwhelm of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.169" style="s2">doctors and nurses getting exhausted and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.099" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">or sick the other one with hospital beds</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.169" end="00:05:20.699" style="s2">being filled they remember equipment</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">being depleted Angeles Lee used is seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.699" end="00:05:26.310" style="s2">to be deeply related to the differential</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:29.669" style="s2">and impact and so once you hit a if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.310" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">if you sort of say there&#39;s a human human</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.669" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">beings without any capacity for medical</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">intervention it looks like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:36.060" style="s2">looking at maybe a five percent</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">mortality rate and by the way the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.060" end="00:05:39.419" style="s2">variance on where I just said is quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">why it may be much higher than that by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.419" end="00:05:44.940" style="s2">the way humans just natural in nature</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">and then as you apply medical</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.940" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">intervention you can drop that all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:51.349" style="s2">way down into what looks like about 0.1</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">2.17</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.349" end="00:05:55.229" style="s2">what that means is that the variance</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">between those two is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.229" end="00:06:00.030" style="s2">degree to which the medical system is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">resilient or robust V the V the caseload</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.030" end="00:06:05.310" style="s2">that it has to care so if you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">hundred patients and you can handle 300</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.310" end="00:06:08.789" style="s2">then you would expect and you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:10.409" style="s2">medical first world medical system you</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.789" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">would expect to see the total impact be</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.409" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">closer to point one seven and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:16.440" style="s2">lower if you&#39;ve got ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.210" end="00:06:17.580" style="s2">patients can handle two hundred you</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.440" end="00:06:19.949" style="s2">might say the total mortality rates</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.580" end="00:06:23.849" style="s2">being up on the five percent range right</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.949" end="00:06:25.889" style="s2">and so then you&#39;re looking at so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.849" end="00:06:29.940" style="s2">got now a third variable you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.889" end="00:06:31.860" style="s2">actual specific characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.940" end="00:06:34.740" style="s2">virus that viruses relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.860" end="00:06:37.770" style="s2">humanity then you&#39;ve got those two now</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.740" end="00:06:39.839" style="s2">in the context of the robustness of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.770" end="00:06:40.139" style="s2">medical response and here but medical</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.839" end="00:06:41.249" style="s2">respond</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.139" end="00:06:43.819" style="s2">including all the different</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.249" end="00:06:46.439" style="s2">characteristics like the the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.819" end="00:06:49.080" style="s2">capacity of the government to choose and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.439" end="00:06:51.270" style="s2">then to actively implement quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.080" end="00:06:54.060" style="s2">draconian quarantine as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.270" end="00:06:55.879" style="s2">medical response right so then I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.060" end="00:06:58.169" style="s2">to know take another step further afield</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.879" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">which we&#39;re seeing any wrong and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.169" end="00:07:02.490" style="s2">seems plausible could see more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.330" end="00:07:04.469" style="s2">which is potentially degradation of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.490" end="00:07:07.349" style="s2">choice making capacity of the governance</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.469" end="00:07:09.439" style="s2">mechanism we have this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.349" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">character characteristic that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.439" end="00:07:15.659" style="s2">pretty highly viral it spreads quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">or it can spread broadly and seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.659" end="00:07:19.169" style="s2">a pretty penetrate but the attack rate</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:20.279" style="s2">meaning that if you&#39;re exposed to it the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:22.979" style="s2">likelihood that you will catch it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.279" end="00:07:25.469" style="s2">reasonably high and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.979" end="00:07:26.789" style="s2">disproportionately impacts people above</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.469" end="00:07:28.349" style="s2">certain ages and with certain immune</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.789" end="00:07:30.419" style="s2">responses and certain characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.349" end="00:07:33.479" style="s2">which happens to de-identify leadership</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.419" end="00:07:35.250" style="s2">in almost every country yes yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.479" end="00:07:37.110" style="s2">projected during an election year when</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.250" end="00:07:38.279" style="s2">our current leadership is spending a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.110" end="00:07:40.589" style="s2">of time for shaking hands and kissing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.279" end="00:07:43.110" style="s2">babies interacting with each other it</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.589" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take much to actually see this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.110" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">exploding into the leadership yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:50.430" style="s2">fact in some sense we might already be</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:51.870" style="s2">seeing that we might already be in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:53.729" style="s2">leading edge of it which we would then</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.870" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">lead to a potential degradation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.729" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">choice-making if you imagine in Iran</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">that are already showing signs of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.580" style="s2">government the government is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:04.409" style="s2">losing its ability to drive effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.580" end="00:08:06.419" style="s2">because more and more leadership is</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.409" end="00:08:08.039" style="s2">actually off the board off their</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.419" end="00:08:09.629" style="s2">capacity to engage in trade cognition</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.039" end="00:08:11.569" style="s2">right which creates another feedback</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.629" end="00:08:14.849" style="s2">loop and so if you say okay the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.569" end="00:08:17.849" style="s2">capacity to perceive and choose to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.849" end="00:08:20.580" style="s2">these draconian quarantines and then to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.849" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">effectively execute on it is premise not</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.580" end="00:08:24.060" style="s2">only on the typology of Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:28.139" style="s2">governance in general which we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.060" end="00:08:29.819" style="s2">have but also on they the availability</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.139" end="00:08:32.190" style="s2">of that governance to propagate down</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.819" end="00:08:33.930" style="s2">through the system given the health of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.190" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">well-being and the understructure</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.930" end="00:08:42.089" style="s2">itself so that&#39;s the fourth variable and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:43.529" style="s2">then another one that&#39;s just showing up</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.089" end="00:08:44.699" style="s2">I think increasingly and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.529" end="00:08:45.899" style="s2">interesting because you know people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.699" end="00:08:47.220" style="s2">different backgrounds it gives them a</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.899" end="00:08:49.380" style="s2">perspective and then if they follow</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:51.779" style="s2">their perspective and feed it back up</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.380" end="00:08:54.010" style="s2">into the larger complex system you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.779" end="00:08:56.610" style="s2">get this great information</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.010" end="00:08:58.870" style="s2">which is pivoting very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.610" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">initially away from the medical side</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.870" end="00:09:04.540" style="s2">into the socio-economic side sure we</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:06.160" style="s2">were already now beginning to see real</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.540" end="00:09:07.660" style="s2">impacts like measurable impacts across a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.160" end="00:09:09.550" style="s2">wide variety of different industries of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.660" end="00:09:13.060" style="s2">the freezing up of the Chinese supply</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.550" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">yeah so the supply chain in China you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.060" end="00:09:16.060" style="s2">know it has been impacted that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:18.460" style="s2">percolated through and even relatively</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.060" end="00:09:21.700" style="s2">prosaic institutions like say</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.460" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">restaurants are showing real blockages</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.700" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">in availability of materials also via</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.910" end="00:09:30.910" style="s2">Iran my partner&#39;s Persian and in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">a lot of the Iranian restaurants are</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.910" end="00:09:34.810" style="s2">shutting down because people are coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">back from traveling in Iran and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.810" end="00:09:37.690" style="s2">bringing back the virus or the threat of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">the virus uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.690" end="00:09:44.290" style="s2">that whole section of of the Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:46.390" style="s2">economy is shutting down I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.290" end="00:09:47.980" style="s2">gonna actually block that as more of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.390" end="00:09:50.410" style="s2">demand side but yes that&#39;s happening too</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.980" end="00:09:52.120" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got one is the supply side is</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.410" end="00:09:53.620" style="s2">percolating up and the others who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.120" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">now particularly the first world getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.620" end="00:09:56.140" style="s2">the demand side which of course the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:58.150" style="s2">first one is wouldn&#39;t rush the demand</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.140" end="00:10:00.580" style="s2">comes from and it&#39;s happening across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.150" end="00:10:02.260" style="s2">board so you know entertainment events</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.580" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">are shutting down canceling big ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.260" end="00:10:06.550" style="s2">small ones mean the Olympics is probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.950" style="s2">going to be nixed South by Southwest is</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.550" end="00:10:10.980" style="s2">probably going to be turned off</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.950" end="00:10:12.400" style="s2">restaurants particularly you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.980" end="00:10:14.650" style="s2">restaurants that within the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.400" end="00:10:16.060" style="s2">epistemological sense making tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.650" end="00:10:18.790" style="s2">proximal to danger like Italian</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.060" end="00:10:21.310" style="s2">restaurants Persian Chinese but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.790" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">gonna spread more rapidly even Corona</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.310" end="00:10:28.960" style="s2">beer hey even crota beer yeah even a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:31.090" style="s2">small semantic relationship yeah Travel</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.960" end="00:10:32.350" style="s2">is getting completely shut down and of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.090" end="00:10:34.270" style="s2">course that and that and that and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.350" end="00:10:36.220" style="s2">and that percolates out so if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.270" end="00:10:37.690" style="s2">it edit from the macro level and now</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.220" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">analyses are coming out on this front I</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.690" end="00:10:40.150" style="s2">just there&#39;s a white paper sitting on my</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:41.890" style="s2">desktop I haven&#39;t went through that came</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.150" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">out of Australia that I think is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.890" end="00:10:51.370" style="s2">some good data on this now if you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:53.620" style="s2">you know if I have a healthy person the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.370" end="00:10:54.220" style="s2">immune system is X right in response to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.620" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">the virus</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.220" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">but now I&#39;ve got somebody who is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">stressed or has lost their job or can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:03.370" style="s2">pay their rent or can&#39;t afford to buy</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:05.740" style="s2">resources to take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.370" end="00:11:07.490" style="s2">then I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m decreasing their</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.740" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">resistance the embedded resistance</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.490" end="00:11:11.690" style="s2">sociological level when it increases not</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">even just the biological resistance</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.690" end="00:11:14.390" style="s2">right when you do that you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:16.100" style="s2">them into scarcity situations the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.390" end="00:11:18.020" style="s2">cognitive flexibility their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.100" end="00:11:19.850" style="s2">properly rationally direct their own</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.020" end="00:11:22.550" style="s2">behavior degenerates as well right</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.850" end="00:11:24.200" style="s2">yes yeah so actually no that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.550" end="00:11:27.020" style="s2">you say that this is a different factor</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.200" end="00:11:29.060" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t been able to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.020" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">into the larger sense which is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.060" end="00:11:34.279" style="s2">noticed that there seems to be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:39.740" style="s2">three epistemological positions right</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.279" end="00:11:42.440" style="s2">now one is panic one is what I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.740" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">call aunty panic and the third is what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.440" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">would call carefulness and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:48.589" style="s2">interesting like I think anti-panic is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:49.550" style="s2">really interesting piece like I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.589" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">really thought about it but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.550" end="00:11:55.430" style="s2">commonplace which is to not actually be</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.940" end="00:11:58.690" style="s2">careful not to not to make a rational</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.430" end="00:12:03.020" style="s2">sort of portfolio allocation of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.690" end="00:12:05.810" style="s2">choices on the basis of rational spent</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.020" end="00:12:08.360" style="s2">risk analysis but actually to choose an</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.810" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">inverted ideological position to panic</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.360" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">and therefore making equally irrational</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:15.589" style="s2">choices but in the exact opposite</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:20.060" style="s2">direction I&#39;ve been personally wrestling</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.589" end="00:12:22.579" style="s2">with that so ok so what&#39;s you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.060" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">live with my son and you know you know I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.579" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">think it&#39;s highly probable that we will</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:29.450" style="s2">get in some sense locked down I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:32.180" style="s2">that&#39;s much more probable for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.450" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">then we will likely catch a fatal form</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.180" end="00:12:37.520" style="s2">of the virus or anything like that so so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:40.790" style="s2">you know we&#39;re putting aside food and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.520" end="00:12:42.589" style="s2">stuff like that and because of that but</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.790" end="00:12:46.910" style="s2">then part of me is part of me is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.589" end="00:12:49.670" style="s2">thinking well like it&#39;s a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.910" end="00:12:51.800" style="s2">inner conflict it&#39;s a yes but am I</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.670" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">actually making these evaluations or am</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.800" end="00:12:56.209" style="s2">i I&#39;m just running I just being driven</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:58.850" style="s2">by you know accessibility and</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.209" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">representativeness bias you know cuz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.850" end="00:13:02.420" style="s2">doing all of this but you know getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.890" end="00:13:05.779" style="s2">in my car is still way more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:08.089" style="s2">and right and you know and I&#39;m still</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.860" end="00:13:15.260" style="s2">more dangerous right and so it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">feel you see what I&#39;m saying like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.260" end="00:13:20.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a one cell with yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">yeah yeah you saw that but something</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.420" end="00:13:23.980" style="s2">comes up so</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:27.090" style="s2">the way the way that look came to nature</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.980" end="00:13:28.840" style="s2">is saying that is it something like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.090" end="00:13:33.070" style="s2">what&#39;s it look like it&#39;s like an</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.460" end="00:13:50.920" style="s2">both of us being relatively mature</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.320" end="00:13:52.690" style="s2">adults may recall that there has been a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.920" end="00:13:54.430" style="s2">real shift in the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.690" end="00:13:57.070" style="s2">behavior and getting in your car and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.430" end="00:14:00.340" style="s2">driving over the past five decades yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.070" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">yes I recall as a child seeing a car</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.340" end="00:14:05.110" style="s2">driving down the road in Texas in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.280" style="s2">70s and the person driving it had the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.110" end="00:14:07.720" style="s2">windows rolled down because you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.280" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">really run the AC because cars would</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.720" end="00:14:11.620" style="s2">blow would overheat with a beer can in</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.110" style="s2">their hand yeah and a cigarette and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.620" end="00:14:15.310" style="s2">their other hand yes which implies</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.110" end="00:14:17.380" style="s2">certain that something about how they</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.310" end="00:14:18.340" style="s2">were driving I guarantee you no seatbelt</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.380" end="00:14:20.140" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.340" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">and so over the past five decades we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.140" end="00:14:24.550" style="s2">done thing want things like embody as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:26.830" style="s2">basic habit don&#39;t drink and drive and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.550" end="00:14:28.270" style="s2">body is a basic habit and I mean whether</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.830" end="00:14:29.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a habit in the person of the habit</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.270" end="00:14:31.960" style="s2">into society enforced by law enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.800" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">as it Matt like it&#39;s a basic habit wear</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.960" end="00:14:37.570" style="s2">a seatbelt so there&#39;s been some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:40.270" style="s2">seeking of social equilibrium of a novel</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.640" end="00:14:51.370" style="s2">that were willing to ingest and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.090" end="00:14:52.780" style="s2">burden ourselves with in order to seek</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.370" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">something which is kind of the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.780" end="00:14:58.270" style="s2">low-hanging risk mitigation in</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.270" end="00:15:02.260" style="s2">doing it kind of bears too much of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.190" end="00:15:03.700" style="s2">cost something like that alright so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.260" end="00:15:04.930" style="s2">get the feeling that but basically what</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.700" end="00:15:06.130" style="s2">we&#39;re all collectively going through</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.930" end="00:15:08.460" style="s2">it&#39;s something along those lines in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.130" end="00:15:10.990" style="s2">relationship with the pandemic that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.460" end="00:15:13.330" style="s2">you know some degree of uncertainty of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.990" end="00:15:15.850" style="s2">the risk so it&#39;s like we may find that</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.330" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">like this time next year or this time</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.850" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">two years from now everybody has a box</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:24.310" style="s2">of you know masks and you know three</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:28.120" style="s2">months of dried goods in their house</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.310" end="00:15:30.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s just why not what&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.120" end="00:15:32.020" style="s2">end of the day the overall cost burden</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.040" end="00:15:32.350" style="s2">is not any different than wearing a seat</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.020" end="00:15:35.470" style="s2">belt</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.350" end="00:15:36.610" style="s2">during the 99.999 seven</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.470" end="00:15:39.640" style="s2">the time that you don&#39;t need a seatbelt</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.610" end="00:15:41.890" style="s2">right like you know we know if the stars</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.640" end="00:15:44.220" style="s2">the stars thing people wearing masks</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.890" end="00:15:46.120" style="s2">while traveling in Asia is quite humble</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.220" end="00:15:47.560" style="s2">and because it&#39;s not that big a deal</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.120" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">once you get over the hump where it</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.560" end="00:15:50.110" style="s2">seems odd I get worried I sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:51.520" style="s2">who I&#39;m not gonna do things that look</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.110" end="00:15:53.110" style="s2">weird once it becomes socially</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.520" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">acceptable alright why not wear a mask</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.110" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">it reduces my risk by n who knows what n</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:16:01.540" style="s2">is but the cost is is less than it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:03.670" style="s2">so that I do it I would say with</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.540" end="00:16:06.270" style="s2">confidence that that&#39;s gonna happen like</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.670" end="00:16:08.460" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a kind of a buildup of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.270" end="00:16:11.640" style="s2">autoimmune like a social level</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.460" end="00:16:13.900" style="s2">sociological autoimmune two pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.640" end="00:16:17.980" style="s2">which is actually a medic question which</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.900" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">is actually kind of kind of neat and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.980" end="00:16:21.940" style="s2">useful that&#39;s useful because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:26.740" style="s2">remember being part of a working group</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.940" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">on biology SF I had like a decade ago</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.740" end="00:16:31.840" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t just viruses like memes</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:33.370" style="s2">and and all kinds of things that spread</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.840" end="00:16:35.530" style="s2">using this kind of mathematics but one</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.370" end="00:16:37.570" style="s2">of the one of them groups that talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.530" end="00:16:38.950" style="s2">about it was actual viruses and it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.570" end="00:16:41.050" style="s2">quite clear at that point they&#39;d given</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.950" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">the the changes in population density</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.050" end="00:16:52.150" style="s2">and travel and even animal husbandry</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:53.890" style="s2">density that novel viruses and bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.150" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">were going to happen and they were going</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.890" end="00:16:56.680" style="s2">to go pandemic there was just no</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:16:57.910" style="s2">question that was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.680" end="00:17:01.560" style="s2">the question is really whenever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.910" end="00:17:04.060" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna look like yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.560" end="00:17:05.650" style="s2">sort of an example and hopefully it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.060" end="00:17:07.210" style="s2">relatively lightweight example of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.650" end="00:17:09.100" style="s2">something like that and so to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.210" end="00:17:11.260" style="s2">to which we get a nice trial run as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.100" end="00:17:11.500" style="s2">global civilization of what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:13.300" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.500" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">it gave me building up some good habits</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.300" end="00:17:19.390" style="s2">on how to respond which would be great</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:23.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting so that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.390" end="00:17:25.840" style="s2">sort of a more like a long term right</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.560" end="00:17:27.910" style="s2">kind of response it&#39;s yeah the medical</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.840" end="00:17:30.280" style="s2">response there&#39;s a cultural shift in</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.910" end="00:17:32.890" style="s2">terms of people&#39;s background habits that</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.280" end="00:17:36.550" style="s2">give an overall increase in adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.890" end="00:17:39.460" style="s2">to the the risk or the threat yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.550" end="00:17:43.660" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know folks who grew up on</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.460" end="00:17:45.730" style="s2">the gulf coast of mexico tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.660" end="00:17:47.890" style="s2">bottled water and gas generators because</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.730" end="00:17:49.390" style="s2">the likelihood of the power going out</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.890" end="00:17:51.190" style="s2">due to a big storm is</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.390" end="00:17:54.340" style="s2">is high enough that everybody&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.190" end="00:17:56.140" style="s2">culturally aware of it and so the impact</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.340" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">of the power going out in that region is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.140" end="00:18:01.960" style="s2">actually not very high because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:03.670" style="s2">Brazilians so this this is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.960" end="00:18:06.430" style="s2">because it gives us kind of an indirect</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.670" end="00:18:08.500" style="s2">historical method of degree to which a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.430" end="00:18:11.650" style="s2">culture is responsive and sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.500" end="00:18:13.480" style="s2">its environment so if we could if we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.650" end="00:18:15.670" style="s2">could measure the dissemination of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.480" end="00:18:19.900" style="s2">habit change we could actually measure</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.670" end="00:18:22.900" style="s2">how in tune to you know its environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.900" end="00:18:24.700" style="s2">a particular culture is so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.900" end="00:18:26.620" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s going to be variations</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.700" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">in this some cultures are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.620" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">very good at sort of taking this up part</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">of its gonna be just how how how much</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">exposure they had right to the virus but</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:39.150" style="s2">part of its also going to be a measure</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">of the capacity for a particular culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.150" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">to pay attention to you know significant</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:49.960" style="s2">environmental changes requiring you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">fundamental restructuring in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.960" end="00:19:01.000" style="s2">habits yeah yeah and we might even say</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:19:05.290" style="s2">also the local structure and the social</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.000" end="00:19:07.800" style="s2">structure both maybe that we will see</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.290" end="00:19:09.790" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain class of</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.790" end="00:19:15.130" style="s2">aren&#39;t responsive enough that they just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.470" end="00:19:17.740" style="s2">move too slowly or too coarsely and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.130" end="00:19:19.810" style="s2">that would actually lead to system or</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.740" end="00:19:21.700" style="s2">institutional change and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.810" end="00:19:25.150" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously things going on oh the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.700" end="00:19:26.260" style="s2">cultural habit habit level yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.150" end="00:19:28.060" style="s2">what was coming to me then it&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.260" end="00:19:30.760" style="s2">meta level there is it seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.060" end="00:19:33.850" style="s2">increasingly likely that in the future</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.760" end="00:19:37.180" style="s2">the human future will be one where delta</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.850" end="00:19:38.440" style="s2">e is higher than your store appear</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.180" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">usages yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.440" end="00:19:47.560" style="s2">exactly and so groups or cultures that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:50.710" style="s2">are more responsive to a higher rate of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.560" end="00:19:52.559" style="s2">and impact of change will tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.710" end="00:19:58.049" style="s2">more adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.559" end="00:19:59.970" style="s2">I wonder also if people&#39;s background</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.049" end="00:20:01.230" style="s2">ontology is going to change I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.970" end="00:20:02.820" style="s2">you start changing habits you start</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.230" end="00:20:04.379" style="s2">changing habitats what I mean by that if</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.820" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">we get a couple of these in relative</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.379" end="00:20:10.009" style="s2">proximity to each other the world is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:13.620" style="s2">suddenly going to see a very very</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.009" end="00:20:15.330" style="s2">dynamically scary place two people not</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.620" end="00:20:17.909" style="s2">that it already wasn&#39;t for many people</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.330" end="00:20:25.139" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to be much more so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.909" end="00:20:28.049" style="s2">case for them and well that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.139" end="00:20:30.090" style="s2">challenge a lot of our priming so our</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.090" end="00:20:33.929" style="s2">environment and did not deny our own</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.860" end="00:20:35.429" style="s2">mortality are going to be significantly</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.929" end="00:20:37.019" style="s2">changed so I&#39;m thinking here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.429" end="00:20:39.869" style="s2">analogous to what the Black Plague did</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.019" end="00:20:42.769" style="s2">right really oh yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.869" end="00:20:44.610" style="s2">fundamentally altered social structures</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.769" end="00:20:47.820" style="s2">altered people&#39;s sense of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.610" end="00:20:52.049" style="s2">mortality really made them see the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.820" end="00:20:54.419" style="s2">as much more chaotic there you know it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.049" end="00:20:57.450" style="s2">even later led to a sort of significant</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.419" end="00:20:59.190" style="s2">reorientation of our cultural self-image</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.450" end="00:21:02.100" style="s2">the will became a much more important</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.190" end="00:21:04.139" style="s2">faculty than reason because when the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.100" end="00:21:06.899" style="s2">universe is more chaotic you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.139" end="00:21:09.590" style="s2">impose your will much more than reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.899" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">finding an order that&#39;s already there</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.590" end="00:21:14.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why you see will based</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:17.249" style="s2">philosophies and ideologies like the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.399" end="00:21:19.049" style="s2">Nazis emerging in times of significant</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.249" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">weather there&#39;s a sense of significant</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.049" end="00:21:24.029" style="s2">chaos and threat people oh no no what</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:26.070" style="s2">really matters is will not reason and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.029" end="00:21:30.929" style="s2">you can even get you can even get anti</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.070" end="00:21:32.759" style="s2">rational things emerging and see why I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.929" end="00:21:35.190" style="s2">bring that up is that could also be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.759" end="00:21:37.700" style="s2">potential feedback mechanism because if</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.190" end="00:21:38.879" style="s2">you get that sort of cultural shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.700" end="00:21:40.950" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.879" end="00:21:43.549" style="s2">that might actually undermine to some</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.950" end="00:21:46.769" style="s2">degree the scientific practices we need</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.549" end="00:21:49.350" style="s2">to have can we need our science to keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.769" end="00:21:52.980" style="s2">moving very rapidly because these things</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.350" end="00:21:54.179" style="s2">are going to keep shifting and yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.980" end="00:21:57.539" style="s2">faster actually we need the science to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.179" end="00:22:00.269" style="s2">actually move faster yes and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.539" end="00:22:02.190" style="s2">take it as a fundamental presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.269" end="00:22:03.960" style="s2">that there is an important constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.190" end="00:22:05.110" style="s2">relationship between science the growth</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.960" end="00:22:07.960" style="s2">of science</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.110" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">human capacity for being rational and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.960" end="00:22:12.670" style="s2">if the world becomes scarier and we see</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:13.780" style="s2">something analogous to what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.670" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">the Black Plague where we get a shift</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.780" end="00:22:18.309" style="s2">towards prioritizing or even the end of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:21.210" style="s2">the Vermont Republic we get a shift</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.309" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">towards the prioritization of the will</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.210" end="00:22:26.890" style="s2">then and don&#39;t let&#39;s not forget that at</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:28.570" style="s2">least North American society seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.890" end="00:22:30.670" style="s2">particularly vulnerable to that already</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.570" end="00:22:32.590" style="s2">right now we have sort of sensitized</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.670" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2">people in general to the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.590" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">can just assert things and make them so</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:39.429" style="s2">I think that could feed back and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:41.950" style="s2">seriously undermine the science we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.429" end="00:22:44.830" style="s2">going to need in order to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.950" end="00:22:46.870" style="s2">these viruses did that make sense as an</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.830" end="00:22:48.309" style="s2">argument yeah it does it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.870" end="00:22:50.559" style="s2">interesting is that I can&#39;t HIPAA thighs</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.309" end="00:22:52.900" style="s2">with it I was trying to actually be that</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.559" end="00:22:58.540" style="s2">person and I noticed I can&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.900" end="00:23:03.130" style="s2">right it&#39;s really interesting so yes if</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.540" end="00:23:05.830" style="s2">I could try that again well yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.130" end="00:23:07.090" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s historically the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.830" end="00:23:07.900" style="s2">so you&#39;re not denying the history that</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.090" end="00:23:09.910" style="s2">I&#39;m referring to</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.900" end="00:23:12.190" style="s2">no no no IIIi completely the history&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.910" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">right I was actually trying to be that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.190" end="00:23:16.600" style="s2">person so I could actually pursue the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:19.150" style="s2">inside right right I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.600" end="00:23:22.210" style="s2">become not see like become somebody for</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.150" end="00:23:27.669" style="s2">whom the response to increasing chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.210" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">a you know triumph of the will</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.669" end="00:23:33.700" style="s2">so I mean this did this is chaos right</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:37.030" style="s2">in the sense like you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.700" end="00:23:38.140" style="s2">earlier about being overwhelmed right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.030" end="00:23:43.020" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna bring with it a tinge of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.140" end="00:23:45.250" style="s2">horror it&#39;s gonna bring the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.020" end="00:23:47.290" style="s2">you know Erickson&#39;s idea about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.250" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">fundamental trust in reality did that</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.290" end="00:23:54.850" style="s2">yeah yeah gets eroded in a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:56.470" style="s2">way and you can either what it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.850" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">seem to you you have only two options</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.470" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2">you can cower or you can fight</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.499" end="00:24:13.830" style="s2">mmm-hmm because there&#39;s nothing in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.739" end="00:24:15.089" style="s2">the world that is unfolding in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.830" end="00:24:17.999" style="s2">predictable manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.089" end="00:24:20.549" style="s2">it&#39;s so you think about the two things</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.999" end="00:24:21.989" style="s2">in animals learning experimental</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.549" end="00:24:24.179" style="s2">neurosis and learned helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.989" end="00:24:26.849" style="s2">okay so experimental neurosis the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.179" end="00:24:28.769" style="s2">environment becomes unpredictable and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.849" end="00:24:31.139" style="s2">the animal becomes very self-destructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.769" end="00:24:33.629" style="s2">where are aggressive and bites itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.139" end="00:24:35.159" style="s2">right or the environment becomes</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.629" end="00:24:36.269" style="s2">predictable this is the opposite but it</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.159" end="00:24:38.129" style="s2">can&#39;t do anything but it becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.269" end="00:24:39.659" style="s2">like depressed right aha</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.129" end="00:24:41.789" style="s2">so I&#39;m saying this is going to be much</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.659" end="00:24:43.379" style="s2">more like experimental neurosis right</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.789" end="00:24:45.719" style="s2">the environments going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.379" end="00:24:48.859" style="s2">unpredictable and the people are going</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.719" end="00:24:54.749" style="s2">to react to that with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.859" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">aggression a kind of yeah so check this</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.749" end="00:24:57.179" style="s2">out so it&#39;s coming to me the way the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:00.139" style="s2">that showing up is looking very</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.179" end="00:25:03.599" style="s2">difficult to process is that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.139" end="00:25:06.539" style="s2">because the rate of change is life could</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.599" end="00:25:08.849" style="s2">it be so high and it&#39;s a multi-modal you</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.539" end="00:25:11.609" style="s2">have the ability to generate a intense</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.849" end="00:25:16.589" style="s2">vector and any direction is is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.609" end="00:25:18.839" style="s2">overwhelmed so it&#39;s kind of like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.589" end="00:25:21.029" style="s2">know if I mean inadequately choppy</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.839" end="00:25:21.450" style="s2">waters a powerboat doesn&#39;t do you any</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.029" end="00:25:24.299" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.450" end="00:25:25.559" style="s2">yes it&#39;s something like that and so what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.299" end="00:25:30.719" style="s2">ends up happening is it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.559" end="00:25:35.489" style="s2">characteristic of the psycho cultural</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.719" end="00:25:38.249" style="s2">dynamic ends up what does it do well it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.489" end="00:25:39.539" style="s2">creates it feels like it just creates</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.249" end="00:25:41.099" style="s2">noise like it feels like what ends up</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.539" end="00:25:43.109" style="s2">happening is that if somebody goes in</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.099" end="00:25:45.659" style="s2">that direction they actually don&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.109" end="00:25:46.919" style="s2">much create entropy because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.659" end="00:25:49.049" style="s2">already so much entropy in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.919" end="00:25:50.549" style="s2">environment they just disconnect</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.049" end="00:25:52.589" style="s2">themselves and basically this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.549" end="00:25:56.219" style="s2">version of turning yourself off like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.589" end="00:25:57.989" style="s2">said it&#39;s it&#39;s a it becomes a neurosis</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.219" end="00:26:02.099" style="s2">where anybody who attaches to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.989" end="00:26:06.310" style="s2">particular modality welcomes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.099" end="00:26:07.900" style="s2">increasingly fit so quickly well</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.310" end="00:26:12.370" style="s2">I think I&#39;m agreeing with that but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.900" end="00:26:14.170" style="s2">want to put a bit of a twist on it what</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.370" end="00:26:16.900" style="s2">you get is sort of the last-ditch form</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.170" end="00:26:18.910" style="s2">of conformity right there&#39;s chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.900" end="00:26:20.920" style="s2">within there&#39;s chaos without and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.910" end="00:26:23.800" style="s2">I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll just run with</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.920" end="00:26:26.020" style="s2">that conformity right and I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.800" end="00:26:30.220" style="s2">become a vehicle I&#39;ll become an</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.020" end="00:26:31.840" style="s2">instrument of oh we recorded when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.220" end="00:26:37.150" style="s2">talked about Panik and anti-panic</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.840" end="00:26:38.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t remember no yeah yeah I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.150" end="00:26:39.970" style="s2">is that I&#39;ve noticed in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.710" end="00:26:43.540" style="s2">the milieu there&#39;s almost like three</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.970" end="00:26:46.060" style="s2">basic positions one disposition is panic</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.540" end="00:26:47.140" style="s2">another disposition is anti panic is</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.060" end="00:26:49.240" style="s2">what I&#39;m calling it and then third</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.140" end="00:26:50.710" style="s2">disposition of something like care in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.240" end="00:26:54.760" style="s2">the context of care there&#39;s of course a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.710" end="00:26:56.050" style="s2">whole continuum of ways that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.760" end="00:26:58.690" style="s2">express and care and that&#39;s based upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.050" end="00:27:00.220" style="s2">their own assessment of the risks and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.690" end="00:27:02.890" style="s2">their own disposition about how they</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.220" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2">relate to risk which is you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.890" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">all kind of what it is but panic and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:08.170" style="s2">anti-panic are very different approaches</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:09.790" style="s2">there these are approaches and seem to</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.170" end="00:27:11.410" style="s2">be disconnected from endeavouring to</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.790" end="00:27:13.720" style="s2">mate sense that make good choices in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.410" end="00:27:17.080" style="s2">environment whatever rather commitments</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.720" end="00:27:19.330" style="s2">to an ideological or a non rational</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.080" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">irrational relationship with reality so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.330" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">it sounds like what you&#39;re describing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.680" end="00:27:25.450" style="s2">anti panic is an occasions example of</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:26.500" style="s2">this sort of thing I yeah maybe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.450" end="00:27:28.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.500" end="00:27:29.650" style="s2">that you could see the two yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.450" end="00:27:32.020" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.650" end="00:27:33.610" style="s2">I guess what I what I ended up doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.020" end="00:27:35.920" style="s2">this was not my intent but I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.610" end="00:27:39.510" style="s2">we got here is trying to try to get you</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.920" end="00:27:42.790" style="s2">try and talk about the way in which this</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.510" end="00:27:46.060" style="s2">milieu of complexity gets internalized</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.790" end="00:27:48.760" style="s2">into people and then how that actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.060" end="00:27:51.880" style="s2">shapes and alters the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.760" end="00:27:55.300" style="s2">cognition and that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.880" end="00:27:59.230" style="s2">like and their rights if people do not</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.300" end="00:28:00.580" style="s2">just have right a manipulative</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.230" end="00:28:02.980" style="s2">relationship to their environment they</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:05.230" style="s2">identify with it and drive identity from</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.980" end="00:28:07.540" style="s2">it and so there&#39;s an additional threat</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.230" end="00:28:09.730" style="s2">that is being posed here and this this</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.540" end="00:28:12.160" style="s2">is what sort of starts to lean into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.730" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">mean crisis that&#39;s what I meant when you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.160" end="00:28:18.570" style="s2">know the people that survived the block</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:20.179" style="s2">like they didn&#39;t die oh right so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.570" end="00:28:22.710" style="s2">but but they come away from it</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.179" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">internalizing a different world and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.710" end="00:28:26.370" style="s2">become different kinds of cells it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:29.970" style="s2">changes human spirituality in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.370" end="00:28:32.549" style="s2">fundamental ways and so I guess I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.970" end="00:28:35.159" style="s2">trying to hear here&#39;s where but maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.549" end="00:28:39.330" style="s2">bit of pushback I try to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.159" end="00:28:40.860" style="s2">anti-panic it sounds symptomatic to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.330" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">in there with language maybe it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.860" end="00:28:43.830" style="s2">and you can correct me if I&#39;m wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.649" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to point to something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.830" end="00:28:48.690" style="s2">could be a much more long-term oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.649" end="00:28:50.070" style="s2">kind of shift oh absolutely I was just</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.690" end="00:28:51.629" style="s2">trying to find out like what&#39;s uh what</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.070" end="00:28:53.580" style="s2">are examples of that long term shifted</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.629" end="00:28:55.649" style="s2">maybe already showing up I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.580" end="00:28:57.809" style="s2">think it&#39;s when you said that sorry so</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.649" end="00:29:00.330" style="s2">when you first made that proposition and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.809" end="00:29:00.929" style="s2">referring to the Black Plague I agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.330" end="00:29:05.220" style="s2">with you completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.929" end="00:29:07.710" style="s2">yeah I think this is a the you know way</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.220" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">of putting it in my language is</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.710" end="00:29:13.590" style="s2">something like the black plague was to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:16.970" style="s2">the Catholic Church what kovat 19 is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.590" end="00:29:20.210" style="s2">the blue church or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.970" end="00:29:25.320" style="s2">at least with some degree of probability</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.210" end="00:29:28.860" style="s2">and you know with box around covered 19</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.320" end="00:29:30.389" style="s2">referring to actually Delta II exact</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.860" end="00:29:33.000" style="s2">changing environment</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.389" end="00:29:34.889" style="s2">the virus is itself symptomatic of more</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.000" end="00:29:36.120" style="s2">things that are going to happen right</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.889" end="00:29:39.899" style="s2">exactly we&#39;re gonna see more and more</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.120" end="00:29:42.600" style="s2">things of this abstract kind yeah across</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.899" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">it and more and more diverse versions</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.600" end="00:29:47.639" style="s2">right as we&#39;re gonna see it coming in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">medical we&#39;ll see it coming in education</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.639" end="00:29:51.289" style="s2">we&#39;ll see you know coming and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.679" end="00:29:54.360" style="s2">in politics economics like usually</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.289" end="00:29:55.710" style="s2">subsistence is the same topology so</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.360" end="00:29:57.870" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is the mind</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.710" end="00:29:59.129" style="s2">what&#39;s the mind that is associate with</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.870" end="00:30:00.779" style="s2">that shift I&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.129" end="00:30:03.659" style="s2">thinking about the distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.779" end="00:30:05.639" style="s2">like that yeah almost the objective</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.659" end="00:30:07.080" style="s2">direction which was it look like and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.639" end="00:30:09.450" style="s2">do people go about doing it but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.080" end="00:30:11.669" style="s2">the mind was the interior experience of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.450" end="00:30:17.100" style="s2">what is the nature of reality like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.669" end="00:30:19.019" style="s2">give you an example yep it&#39;s been so</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.100" end="00:30:20.789" style="s2">long since I&#39;ve been in this is personal</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.019" end="00:30:23.909" style="s2">state I don&#39;t actually even remember</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.789" end="00:30:26.760" style="s2">what the prior state is like but so this</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.909" end="00:30:32.130" style="s2">is just their state a and the state be</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.760" end="00:30:34.200" style="s2">okay he is way</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.130" end="00:30:35.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like Modern Portfolio theory or</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.200" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">sort of like Bayesian statistical</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.730" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">probability where it has not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:47.610" style="s2">fundamental but inescapable mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:51.510" style="s2">and so there is no notion of there being</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.610" end="00:30:56.790" style="s2">a true with the capital T there is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.510" end="00:31:00.830" style="s2">notion there being a cloud of possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.790" end="00:31:04.020" style="s2">T&#39;s and the implications thereof and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.830" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this sort of large nest of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.020" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">things coming through you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">actual moment that you&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:08.970" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got a large nest of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">coming out and you just kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.970" end="00:31:12.600" style="s2">rolling through that so you at any</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:14.100" style="s2">moment this instantaneous moment is kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.600" end="00:31:17.700" style="s2">of a collapse of the possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.100" end="00:31:19.530" style="s2">into an actual from which I can change</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.700" end="00:31:20.970" style="s2">my sense of what the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.530" end="00:31:22.050" style="s2">next moment is going to look like but</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.970" end="00:31:25.350" style="s2">I&#39;m always dealing with a probability</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.050" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">manifold sure and therefore my choice</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.350" end="00:31:28.200" style="s2">making is very much like a modern</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:29.550" style="s2">portfolio manager in the financial</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.200" end="00:31:32.550" style="s2">system who&#39;s basically just allocating</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.550" end="00:31:35.580" style="s2">you know risk correlates with each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.550" end="00:31:37.230" style="s2">yeah and you know that I think that just</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.580" end="00:31:40.440" style="s2">massively overlaps with issues around</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.230" end="00:31:43.350" style="s2">relevance realization etc etc yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.440" end="00:31:45.810" style="s2">so I feel like my sense is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.350" end="00:31:47.940" style="s2">not commonplace my sense is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.810" end="00:31:51.350" style="s2">a different epistemology which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.940" end="00:31:51.350" style="s2">something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.250" end="00:31:58.350" style="s2">paradigmatic that&#39;s okay that that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.860" end="00:32:00.090" style="s2">think languaging evidence and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.350" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">kuhnian sense yeah okay so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.090" end="00:32:07.260" style="s2">that the paradigmatic mind is a mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:11.340" style="s2">that has a an obligate or near obligate</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.260" end="00:32:14.550" style="s2">a high degree of necessity of being of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.340" end="00:32:17.700" style="s2">connecting to one and only one dominant</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.550" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">sense making framework which collapse is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.700" end="00:32:22.560" style="s2">the possibility space enormous I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:23.430" style="s2">it proves the possibility space enormous</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.560" end="00:32:25.680" style="s2">and because you don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.430" end="00:32:27.060" style="s2">epistemological uncertainty you only</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.680" end="00:32:28.200" style="s2">have uncertainty around the state of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.060" end="00:32:33.300" style="s2">facts that are fitting into your</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.200" end="00:32:34.830" style="s2">particular epistemological frame and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.300" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.830" end="00:32:38.279" style="s2">one of the things that goes away and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:39.299" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say actually what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.279" end="00:32:41.580" style="s2">interesting is I&#39;m gonna say that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.299" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">emerged out of the Black Plague was that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.580" end="00:32:48.779" style="s2">kind of Mike the paradigmatic mind yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:51.750" style="s2">you don&#39;t think it exists before the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.779" end="00:32:54.210" style="s2">Black Plague I don&#39;t think so or if it</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.750" end="00:32:56.940" style="s2">did I think existed very differently you</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.210" end="00:32:59.090" style="s2">see if I can unfurl what&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.940" end="00:33:02.070" style="s2">saying these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.090" end="00:33:03.510" style="s2">why would I say such a thing so I like</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.070" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">first I wanna make sure I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.510" end="00:33:07.260" style="s2">understanding what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:11.250" style="s2">paradigmatic so what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.260" end="00:33:12.600" style="s2">paradigmatic is a commitment because</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.250" end="00:33:13.169" style="s2">there&#39;s different readings of Kuhn I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.600" end="00:33:16.620" style="s2">want to make sure I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.169" end="00:33:19.049" style="s2">misunderstanding it yeah yeah so you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.620" end="00:33:21.809" style="s2">you can read the paradigm as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.049" end="00:33:26.100" style="s2">pragmatic thing or you can read the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.809" end="00:33:28.080" style="s2">paradigm as something that has some sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.100" end="00:33:30.419" style="s2">of realistic value to it like you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.080" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s an approximation to the real world</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.419" end="00:33:36.269" style="s2">or something like that and then what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">heard you saying was what you meant by</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.269" end="00:33:44.070" style="s2">paradigmatic is people have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:47.220" style="s2">there is one true final complete picture</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.070" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">of things and the goal of epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.220" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">broadly construed is to get to that one</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:59.070" style="s2">true picture is that the only thing no</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:34:02.580" style="s2">no it&#39;s more like more like the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.070" end="00:34:08.909" style="s2">actually nice but the key is that that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.580" end="00:34:12.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a almost everybody is it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.909" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">read only on the paradigm so while there</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.839" end="00:34:17.730" style="s2">may be a willingness and at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">level philosophy and acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.730" end="00:34:23.159" style="s2">premise that the paradigm is the map and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.980" style="s2">not the territory mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.159" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">almost everybody is read only on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.980" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">map and almost everybody is actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:33.419" style="s2">unaware of the fact that they&#39;re using a</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:38.540" style="s2">map to enter intermediate the territory</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.419" end="00:34:42.089" style="s2">so for practical purposes it shows as</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.540" end="00:34:42.990" style="s2">capital T true I see I see which is one</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.089" end="00:34:47.089" style="s2">of the reasons why it has such a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.990" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">hardness like a break like paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.089" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:54.370" style="s2">to have a collapse vector they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.990" end="00:34:57.140" style="s2">be crack and crumble as opposed to slide</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.370" end="00:34:59.390" style="s2">so let me try again then this is helpful</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.140" end="00:35:01.130" style="s2">you&#39;re saying the paradigm is almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.390" end="00:35:03.130" style="s2">completely transparent to most people</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.130" end="00:35:05.360" style="s2">and that they have sort of no</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.130" end="00:35:06.890" style="s2">metacognitive awareness of it in</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.360" end="00:35:10.340" style="s2">practice they might have certain sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.890" end="00:35:11.750" style="s2">you know abstract statements about you</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.340" end="00:35:13.880" style="s2">know paradigms or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.750" end="00:35:17.630" style="s2">but in practice for most people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.880" end="00:35:22.850" style="s2">completely transparent yeah okay now I</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.630" end="00:35:24.230" style="s2">got you yeah and so there&#39;s something so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.850" end="00:35:25.610" style="s2">let&#39;s see what was this moustache if</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.230" end="00:35:28.520" style="s2">that happens if you take you zoom in on</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.610" end="00:35:29.480" style="s2">the on the on the black play and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.520" end="00:35:31.840" style="s2">ever cut a bunch of different things are</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.480" end="00:35:35.030" style="s2">going on simultaneously right you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.840" end="00:35:40.940" style="s2">you got the plague you&#39;ve got exploding</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.030" end="00:35:42.260" style="s2">literacy you&#39;ve got not too long after</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.940" end="00:35:44.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to discover the new world</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.260" end="00:35:49.160" style="s2">which changes consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.800" end="00:35:51.020" style="s2">space-time so it&#39;s the breakup of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.160" end="00:35:53.330" style="s2">Catholic world like the true Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.020" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">world sure in the meaning of the word</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.330" end="00:36:00.440" style="s2">Catholic Universal even just the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.210" style="s2">emergence of Protestantism processes and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.440" end="00:36:05.350" style="s2">the maps to paradigmatic right that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.210" end="00:36:08.600" style="s2">notion of there being a an</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.350" end="00:36:14.060" style="s2">acknowledgment of the possibility of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.600" end="00:36:14.870" style="s2">multiplicity of fundamental models of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.060" end="00:36:22.310" style="s2">what is true</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.870" end="00:36:28.490" style="s2">sure and and a distributed cognition how</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.310" end="00:36:32.150" style="s2">would I put it method the reorients the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.490" end="00:36:33.620" style="s2">source of true knowledge and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:38.180" style="s2">movement of the source of true knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.620" end="00:36:40.730" style="s2">from the institution the structure to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.180" end="00:36:42.770" style="s2">the individual is that a thing right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.730" end="00:36:46.370" style="s2">let&#39;s part of that whole shift towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.770" end="00:36:48.650" style="s2">the individual will becoming crucial you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.370" end="00:36:51.230" style="s2">you see it and then of course that</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.650" end="00:36:54.620" style="s2">reflects back God changes becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.230" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">will based right and eventually when</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.620" end="00:36:59.360" style="s2">even when that God disappears he that</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:01.850" style="s2">orientation survives and the will to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.360" end="00:37:02.580" style="s2">power of Nietzsche and and things like</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.850" end="00:37:04.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.580" end="00:37:10.020" style="s2">so you get this long-term fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.920" end="00:37:11.700" style="s2">change so yeah so what&#39;s what changing</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.020" end="00:37:15.150" style="s2">sounds sounds to me like you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:18.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a change from some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.150" end="00:37:20.790" style="s2">epistemological monism to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.570" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">pluralism and then the response to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.790" end="00:37:26.730" style="s2">pluralism is sort of the individual will</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:28.500" style="s2">must impose because the pluralism ZAR</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.730" end="00:37:30.150" style="s2">competing with each other is that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.500" end="00:37:31.910" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a bunch of thing so think</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.150" end="00:37:34.440" style="s2">about it it&#39;s really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.910" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">so so in the second mode so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.440" end="00:37:41.250" style="s2">post black death mode we might call just</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:45.510" style="s2">it in the Enlightenment era one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.250" end="00:37:47.580" style="s2">this for sure is that is the a real loss</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.510" end="00:37:54.870" style="s2">of faith in the possibility of a single</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.580" end="00:37:57.090" style="s2">fully integrated T mode right so we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.870" end="00:38:00.180" style="s2">a diversity of different paradigms that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.090" end="00:38:03.570" style="s2">are domain-specific so you know an Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.180" end="00:38:06.150" style="s2">Newton is gonna be holding a paradigm in</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.570" end="00:38:09.030" style="s2">relationship to physics and then another</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.150" end="00:38:10.860" style="s2">in relationship to religion and probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.030" end="00:38:11.790" style="s2">another in relationship to politics all</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.860" end="00:38:13.350" style="s2">right all right you got a harbor</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.790" end="00:38:15.900" style="s2">master&#39;s thesis that you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.350" end="00:38:18.090" style="s2">these you get these autonomous spheres</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.900" end="00:38:20.610" style="s2">of authority rather than a single</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.090" end="00:38:25.050" style="s2">Authority yeah yeah exactly and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.610" end="00:38:29.670" style="s2">a mapping issue the mapping happens to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:32.010" style="s2">this medium of textual communication so</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.670" end="00:38:34.670" style="s2">what ends up happening is the letters</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.010" end="00:38:38.280" style="s2">and books flying around create a new</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.670" end="00:38:41.940" style="s2">milieu of paradigm coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.280" end="00:38:45.530" style="s2">paradigm editing and modification and in</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.940" end="00:38:48.570" style="s2">this notion of like Dewey Decimal</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.530" end="00:38:51.650" style="s2">disciplinary structures a lot allow</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.570" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">domain specificity so I can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.650" end="00:38:56.400" style="s2">there may be a completing compatibility</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:38:57.810" style="s2">between the evolutionary paradigm and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.400" end="00:38:59.670" style="s2">the physics paradigm but because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.810" end="00:39:00.840" style="s2">so far apart of the members of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.670" end="00:39:02.370" style="s2">groups don&#39;t communicate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.840" end="00:39:04.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t notice it and then when they</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.370" end="00:39:05.910" style="s2">run into each other there&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.080" end="00:39:07.710" style="s2">you know is there an integration between</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.910" end="00:39:10.590" style="s2">the two or just kind of ignore them or</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.710" end="00:39:12.420" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.590" end="00:39:14.490" style="s2">of the things a story of the last 500</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.420" end="00:39:16.210" style="s2">years has been that kind of thing okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.490" end="00:39:18.070" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.210" end="00:39:19.450" style="s2">so I just also by the way I get now your</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.070" end="00:39:20.650" style="s2">thesis it&#39;s cleared this by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.450" end="00:39:23.410" style="s2">interesting because it relates to an</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.650" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">ambient like if an ambient Delta eat you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.410" end="00:39:28.300" style="s2">know one of the characteristics of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:29.830" style="s2">of the shift from the pre enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.300" end="00:39:32.200" style="s2">to the Enlightenment ear was in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.830" end="00:39:34.810" style="s2">change in Delta e in along many</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.200" end="00:39:38.050" style="s2">different context yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.810" end="00:39:39.460" style="s2">and so the emergence of that particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.050" end="00:39:41.109" style="s2">kind of mind paradigmatic in mind in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.460" end="00:39:42.330" style="s2">fact probably is as I&#39;m speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.109" end="00:39:44.530" style="s2">it right now I&#39;m just thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.330" end="00:39:45.670" style="s2">analogous to the adaptive response that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.530" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about is the transition to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.670" end="00:39:48.760" style="s2">undergoing right now which is there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:52.890" style="s2">need a fundamental need to transition</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.760" end="00:39:56.730" style="s2">from a particular kind of mind that had</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.890" end="00:40:01.170" style="s2">huge advantages under certain values of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.730" end="00:40:04.359" style="s2">Delta II but just broke down under</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.170" end="00:40:06.490" style="s2">values exceeding Delta II and so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.359" end="00:40:08.830" style="s2">shifted to this new one and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.490" end="00:40:11.080" style="s2">map out I think very well in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.830" end="00:40:13.450" style="s2">different dimensions the ways that this</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.080" end="00:40:15.400" style="s2">new kind of mind tried to get his act</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.450" end="00:40:17.140" style="s2">together tried to hang together as I</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.400" end="00:40:20.530" style="s2">kept running into a Correa&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.140" end="00:40:22.390" style="s2">bottlenecks and situations were old</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.530" end="00:40:24.420" style="s2">material unraveled and you realize you</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.390" end="00:40:27.339" style="s2">were holding on to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.420" end="00:40:28.780" style="s2">mmm so now we&#39;re in a context where not</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.339" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">only are we faced with the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.780" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">crisis in the context of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:35.380" style="s2">them burning out of that model or that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:37.480" style="s2">meta model that approach we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.380" end="00:40:39.130" style="s2">running into the obsolescence of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:40.270" style="s2">model in the context of a rate of delta</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.130" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">e that is higher than would it could</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.270" end="00:40:51.130" style="s2">have handled yes yes yes yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">that&#39;s really nice so check this out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.130" end="00:40:54.790" style="s2">gonna say that again</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:59.410" style="s2">it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.790" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">on the one hand in the almost on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.410" end="00:41:07.240" style="s2">interior of enlightenment mind it has</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.790" style="s2">its own structural instabilities that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.240" end="00:41:14.110" style="s2">kind of as it as it expands and begins</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.790" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">to do its own thing to be itself it</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.110" end="00:41:17.920" style="s2">begins to break down and a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">ways and and ultimately precede this as</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.920" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">the meaning crisis and all this</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.970" end="00:41:23.590" style="s2">different characteristics from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:28.300" style="s2">inside out as a woman and then you flip</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.590" end="00:41:29.710" style="s2">it and you say okay and also if we kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.300" end="00:41:34.660" style="s2">of put ourselves in a place I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.710" end="00:41:36.250" style="s2">like Victorian England 1870 1880 I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.660" end="00:41:40.540" style="s2">know would be like peak enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.250" end="00:41:44.940" style="s2">mind like really functional maybe was</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.540" end="00:41:47.890" style="s2">actually like Germany around the time of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.940" end="00:41:51.930" style="s2">the Romantic Romantic movement exactly</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.890" end="00:41:54.100" style="s2">sure when we could say pyramid that mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.930" end="00:41:55.330" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly have dealt with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.100" end="00:41:57.940" style="s2">level of delta ii that we&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.330" end="00:41:59.290" style="s2">now no no it&#39;s very fundamental nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.940" end="00:42:02.050" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t do this kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.290" end="00:42:04.180" style="s2">on them on the left hand side of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.050" end="00:42:07.930" style="s2">meta-crisis the meaning crisis i guess</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.180" end="00:42:09.700" style="s2">the right hand side you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.930" end="00:42:12.580" style="s2">interior meaning that the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.700" end="00:42:15.100" style="s2">is is is showing us that this approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.580" end="00:42:17.530" style="s2">is in breakdown across the board</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.100" end="00:42:20.470" style="s2">reckon on the left hand side you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.530" end="00:42:22.930" style="s2">the consequence which is that the delta</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.470" end="00:42:27.430" style="s2">ii that we are in and are continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.930" end="00:42:30.370" style="s2">to accelerate it overwhelms that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.430" end="00:42:32.320" style="s2">approach even it is best i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.370" end="00:42:37.720" style="s2">that i think that&#39;s really important i</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.320" end="00:42:40.810" style="s2">think i think that explicate sand</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.720" end="00:42:42.190" style="s2">elucidates an intuition i&#39;ve had for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.810" end="00:42:43.150" style="s2">very long time which i try to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.190" end="00:42:45.490" style="s2">that there&#39;s a deep interconnection</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.150" end="00:42:46.540" style="s2">between the meeting crisis and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.490" end="00:42:49.870" style="s2">crisis but now there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.540" end="00:42:53.130" style="s2">specification to it i maybe it would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.870" end="00:42:56.950" style="s2">helpful to think about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.130" end="00:42:59.110" style="s2">interior identity that people had in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.950" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">sort of that whole enlightenment phase</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.110" end="00:43:06.970" style="s2">and how even it see one of the issues is</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.090" end="00:43:08.700" style="s2">that you know that interior identity is</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.970" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">still being held onto even though</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.700" end="00:43:14.140" style="s2">the meaning crisis is showing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:16.900" style="s2">it&#39;s collapsing because it&#39;s Pro</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.140" end="00:43:20.680" style="s2">generating history it has undermined its</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.900" end="00:43:22.900" style="s2">its own grammar but that&#39;s one thing but</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.680" end="00:43:25.600" style="s2">then the other thing is with so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.900" end="00:43:28.390" style="s2">that&#39;s your pointing back and yes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.600" end="00:43:31.000" style="s2">pointing forward is ways in which that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.390" end="00:43:33.070" style="s2">is not a vote that you&#39;ll allow me these</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.000" end="00:43:37.000" style="s2">two terms ways in which that is not only</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.070" end="00:43:40.120" style="s2">a degenerative interior identity about</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.000" end="00:43:44.380" style="s2">ways in which it&#39;s an exacerbating</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.120" end="00:43:45.970" style="s2">flirting interior identity it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.380" end="00:43:48.900" style="s2">only that it&#39;s degenerate that it can no</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.970" end="00:43:53.790" style="s2">longer but deal with its own history</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.900" end="00:43:58.090" style="s2">right it&#39;s also you know preventing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.790" end="00:43:59.620" style="s2">exacerbating he attempts to it&#39;s uh you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.090" end="00:44:01.780" style="s2">know if you allow me a temporal metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.620" end="00:44:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;s slowing down the rate of adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.780" end="00:44:06.520" style="s2">that&#39;s needed for the acceleration and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.880" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">Delta V yes this is this is why I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.520" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">saying that these these this paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">for example has characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">collapse it has this this thing where it</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.400" end="00:44:20.530" style="s2">holds the resources that are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.500" end="00:44:24.580" style="s2">for adaptation in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.530" end="00:44:28.300" style="s2">arrangement and will continue to do so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.580" end="00:44:30.970" style="s2">until enough energy is behind the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.300" end="00:44:32.620" style="s2">change that needs to be made that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.970" end="00:44:34.180" style="s2">energy is enough to break this capacity</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.620" end="00:44:36.820" style="s2">to hold mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.180" end="00:44:40.870" style="s2">yeah this is like a psychotic break yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.820" end="00:44:43.510" style="s2">yes you have a complete catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.870" end="00:44:46.270" style="s2">collapse of identity in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.510" end="00:44:47.770" style="s2">something and instead of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.270" end="00:44:48.550" style="s2">make a smooth transition the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.770" end="00:44:50.470" style="s2">just falls apart</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.550" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s great because that now</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.470" end="00:44:56.320" style="s2">now we&#39;ve I think we&#39;ve began made more</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:58.840" style="s2">articulate this idea of how the external</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.320" end="00:45:00.970" style="s2">chaos actually gets internalized and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.840" end="00:45:05.080" style="s2">you start to get this resonance between</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.970" end="00:45:06.310" style="s2">them yeah yeah so yeah in other we say</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.080" end="00:45:09.730" style="s2">that I get the feeling that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.310" end="00:45:11.440" style="s2">psychosis is probably the right model it</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.730" end="00:45:14.920" style="s2">was just to say that we should expect to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.440" end="00:45:17.350" style="s2">see the maladaptive response to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.920" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">current environment to be an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.350" end="00:45:23.220" style="s2">the directionality towards psychosis yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:28.890" style="s2">so the defining features of psychosis is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.220" end="00:45:31.440" style="s2">to generally lose a grip on reality</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.890" end="00:45:34.380" style="s2">because you see far too many patterns</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.440" end="00:45:36.630" style="s2">where there aren&#39;t patterns right so</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.380" end="00:45:39.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a decline in the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.630" end="00:45:42.540" style="s2">discern real patterns from merely</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.930" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">correlational patterns so psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.540" end="00:45:47.220" style="s2">people people that are moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:49.140" style="s2">psychosis if you give them a screen of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.220" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">static they they&#39;re much more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.140" end="00:45:56.220" style="s2">see or even experience mmm right and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:58.080" style="s2">so they actually feel like it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.220" end="00:46:00.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s even called a psychotic right</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.080" end="00:46:03.060" style="s2">insight they they often feel like</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.240" end="00:46:04.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve had because they do right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.060" end="00:46:06.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a perversion of the insight</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.680" end="00:46:09.750" style="s2">machinery because they suddenly realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.950" end="00:46:12.150" style="s2">patterns that other people aren&#39;t seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.750" end="00:46:15.090" style="s2">and that of course gives you right a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.150" end="00:46:17.820" style="s2">tremendous sense that you are now</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.090" end="00:46:19.500" style="s2">getting in touch with this chaotic world</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.820" end="00:46:20.730" style="s2">well I would say that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.500" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">essence of this thing that you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.730" end="00:46:23.100" style="s2">calling earlier the will right right</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:25.350" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.100" end="00:46:29.100" style="s2">okay I can&#39;t you know it when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.350" end="00:46:31.080" style="s2">a psychotic break your your will yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.100" end="00:46:35.340" style="s2">you&#39;re going to actually impose your</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.080" end="00:46:37.160" style="s2">will in the world is is reduced to your</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.340" end="00:46:41.130" style="s2">ability to impose a preferred</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.160" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">meaning-making so the way to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.130" end="00:46:44.460" style="s2">feeling of the head of insight to feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:46.470" style="s2">the feeling of I&#39;m making sense of where</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.460" end="00:46:48.150" style="s2">that&#39;s all you can get do is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.470" end="00:46:51.090" style="s2">actually affect the world in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.150" end="00:46:54.420" style="s2">really durably over time building a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.090" end="00:46:56.730" style="s2">long-term construct but what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.420" end="00:46:59.670" style="s2">is you can feel like everything makes</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.730" end="00:47:02.370" style="s2">sense so would that mean then what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.670" end="00:47:05.910" style="s2">should see if this line of argument is</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.370" end="00:47:11.310" style="s2">going the right way is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.910" end="00:47:14.430" style="s2">see an increase in people creating over</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.310" end="00:47:15.540" style="s2">our drive to great overarching fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.430" end="00:47:18.090" style="s2">in the pejorative sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.540" end="00:47:21.320" style="s2">fantastic like meta-narratives like</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.090" end="00:47:23.820" style="s2">grand conspiracy theories yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.320" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">absolutely yeah because you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.820" end="00:47:27.750" style="s2">have two things happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:30.360" style="s2">one is they&#39;re going to be taking the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.750" end="00:47:32.430" style="s2">red pill they&#39;re gonna exit the existing</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.360" end="00:47:34.470" style="s2">dominant sense making and media making</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.430" end="00:47:35.940" style="s2">architectures that are clearly black</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.470" end="00:47:37.650" style="s2">stop feeling all around them yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.940" end="00:47:39.960" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna dive into the deep end</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.650" end="00:47:42.030" style="s2">about a Delta II that is way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.960" end="00:47:44.369" style="s2">their capacity to make sense of it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.030" end="00:47:45.690" style="s2">and either oh it&#39;s nice didn&#39;t usually</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.369" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">really either get a learned helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.690" end="00:47:50.040" style="s2">I kind of get a shutdown overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:52.170" style="s2">yeah or you&#39;re gonna get the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.040" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">of a neurotic you know in this case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.170" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">a psychotic break right right right</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.900" end="00:48:01.369" style="s2">exactly yeah luckily yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:04.520" style="s2">question and you&#39;re gonna feel empowered</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.369" end="00:48:08.520" style="s2">for both of those alternatives because</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.520" end="00:48:10.560" style="s2">the tradition right is right has</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.520" end="00:48:13.020" style="s2">basically let you down yes very very</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.560" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">profound ways oh absolutely in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.020" end="00:48:16.380" style="s2">the only thing you can really hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.570" style="s2">for sure that the tradition it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.380" end="00:48:20.099" style="s2">work yes yes it&#39;s almost like your your</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.570" end="00:48:21.420" style="s2">spirit you you know how to steer away</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.099" end="00:48:23.220" style="s2">from something the question is what are</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.420" end="00:48:24.270" style="s2">you steering towards right right so</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.220" end="00:48:25.859" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s do this I mean I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.270" end="00:48:28.470" style="s2">pivot all the way back to the outside</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.859" end="00:48:30.359" style="s2">coming back in sure but consciously not</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.470" end="00:48:31.830" style="s2">at a meta level using that to inform</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.359" end="00:48:33.030" style="s2">this conversation because I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.830" end="00:48:35.490" style="s2">there&#39;s something very powerful here</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.030" end="00:48:36.599" style="s2">cool so one of the things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.490" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">contemplating this morning is I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.599" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">running a an integration pass is that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:44.550" style="s2">actually feels like there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.260" end="00:48:50.190" style="s2">strong bifurcation in terms of the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.550" end="00:48:52.440" style="s2">impact of kovat 19 Mon us right right</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.190" end="00:48:54.570" style="s2">though so I&#39;m gonna push a button and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.440" end="00:48:56.070" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do a flash collapse of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.570" end="00:48:59.580" style="s2">Bayesian net and just take a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.070" end="00:49:01.260" style="s2">assumptions please so the highest</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.580" end="00:49:03.900" style="s2">probability models that I&#39;ve seen have</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.260" end="00:49:07.230" style="s2">something like the and the ambient</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.900" end="00:49:08.940" style="s2">mortality rate is something on the order</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.230" end="00:49:10.680" style="s2">of an average of about five percent</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.940" end="00:49:12.240" style="s2">meaning they&#39;re just sort of introduced</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.680" end="00:49:14.099" style="s2">us to wild-type humans you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.240" end="00:49:15.780" style="s2">fifteen to twenty percent mortality</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.099" end="00:49:17.820" style="s2">above eighty and kind of casting you</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.780" end="00:49:19.770" style="s2">know curves down and so cross total</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.820" end="00:49:23.270" style="s2">populations skewing higher for men you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.770" end="00:49:25.260" style="s2">get kind of that rate and then in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.270" end="00:49:27.690" style="s2">well-managed high-quality medical</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.260" end="00:49:29.339" style="s2">environment it&#39;s sort of below point two</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.690" end="00:49:31.589" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the spread that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.339" end="00:49:33.150" style="s2">dealing with it&#39;s a huge variation huge</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.589" end="00:49:36.020" style="s2">variation and what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.150" end="00:49:39.089" style="s2">that variation feeds back on itself so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.020" end="00:49:43.320" style="s2">to the degree to which your choice</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.089" end="00:49:46.020" style="s2">making your social choice making make</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.320" end="00:49:47.130" style="s2">sense of the risk and then make choices</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.020" end="00:49:49.410" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:52.290" style="s2">maintained the resilience and integrity</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.410" end="00:49:54.660" style="s2">of your choice making and action taking</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.290" end="00:49:57.900" style="s2">capacity particularly the subdomain of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.660" end="00:50:00.210" style="s2">of your medical system and your agentive</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.900" end="00:50:02.280" style="s2">capacity is equal to the vector of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.210" end="00:50:03.840" style="s2">harm that you&#39;re dealing with then</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.280" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">you&#39;re actually able to hold the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.840" end="00:50:08.580" style="s2">system dynamics in this left-hand path</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:10.470" style="s2">and keep it at below point two and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.580" end="00:50:12.540" style="s2">it burns out I so more or less the story</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.470" end="00:50:14.280" style="s2">of China as far as we can tell and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.540" end="00:50:15.960" style="s2">have this thing the tidal wave was</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.280" end="00:50:18.780" style="s2">building right it&#39;s got this exponential</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.960" end="00:50:20.670" style="s2">build curve you see it coming you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.780" end="00:50:22.290" style="s2">respond quickly enough and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.670" end="00:50:24.030" style="s2">enough embedded resilience at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.290" end="00:50:26.760" style="s2">medical level that your medical system</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.030" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">can take it absorb the energy of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.760" end="00:50:32.370" style="s2">coming at you not get overwhelmed hold</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:36.090" style="s2">hold hold and then it ships that now</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.370" end="00:50:37.290" style="s2">right so that&#39;s kind of path one and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.090" end="00:50:38.910" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about path one is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.290" end="00:50:40.950" style="s2">that it has a bunch of self-reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.910" end="00:50:42.510" style="s2">feedback loops is that once you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.950" end="00:50:45.030" style="s2">see that it&#39;s working what gets what</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.510" end="00:50:46.230" style="s2">works gets more cycles pointed to it you</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.030" end="00:50:47.640" style="s2">begin to realize what the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.230" end="00:50:50.370" style="s2">dealing with looks like there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.640" end="00:50:57.120" style="s2">bunch of stuff on path one then passed</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.370" end="00:51:00.060" style="s2">to what happens is you know you wait too</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.120" end="00:51:02.130" style="s2">long or you act too slowly or you ask</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.060" end="00:51:03.780" style="s2">with not enough resilience or impact and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.130" end="00:51:06.630" style="s2">you start getting to a point of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.780" end="00:51:07.860" style="s2">overwhelm and you get overwhelmed let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:09.090" style="s2">say the medical level that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.860" end="00:51:10.380" style="s2">have enough hospital beds you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.090" end="00:51:13.110" style="s2">enough ventilators you don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.380" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">spent antivirals you don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.110" end="00:51:17.640" style="s2">hospital staff you don&#39;t move hospital</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:19.530" style="s2">staff correctly you know wherever it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.640" end="00:51:21.000" style="s2">weakens the immune system of your social</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.530" end="00:51:23.370" style="s2">environment as you start seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.000" end="00:51:24.840" style="s2">mortality rate going ah because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.370" end="00:51:30.090" style="s2">starting to get outside of the zone of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.840" end="00:51:31.950" style="s2">controlled situation and and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.090" end="00:51:34.350" style="s2">also not just not just a mortality rate</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.950" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">but but even more importantly in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.350" end="00:51:37.350" style="s2">initial stages the virality rate your</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:38.250" style="s2">quarantine structures aren&#39;t strong</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.350" end="00:51:39.870" style="s2">enough and you&#39;re just trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.250" end="00:51:40.920" style="s2">more and more you&#39;re fighting a fire</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.870" end="00:51:43.410" style="s2">that&#39;s growing faster than your</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.920" end="00:51:45.810" style="s2">responsive capacity and so once once the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.410" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">fire gets past a certain threshold in</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.810" end="00:51:50.070" style="s2">its relationship with your responsive</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.390" style="s2">capacity you start getting a separation</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.070" end="00:51:53.820" style="s2">because it&#39;s degrading your responsive</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.390" end="00:51:55.380" style="s2">capacity ya know you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.820" end="00:51:57.330" style="s2">something where you&#39;re depleting your</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.380" end="00:51:59.220" style="s2">medical resources you&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.330" end="00:52:00.750" style="s2">lose like we&#39;ve actually seen now people</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.710" end="00:52:15.990" style="s2">about earlier you&#39;ve got the degradation</p>

<p begin="00:52:15.990" end="00:52:19.740" style="s2">you run as a situation where their</p>

<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:28.350" style="s2">this becomes the right-hand path source</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.810" style="s2">looked a lot like the right hand path</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.460" end="00:52:59.580" style="s2">left to its own devices if Wuhan was by</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.810" end="00:53:00.480" style="s2">itself it would been on the right hand</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.580" end="00:53:01.890" style="s2">path like it would have been they would</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.480" end="00:53:03.720" style="s2">have been melt up there&#39;s no there was</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.890" end="00:53:06.180" style="s2">no benefit because mulan was in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.720" end="00:53:07.890" style="s2">context of china as a larger context</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.180" end="00:53:11.070" style="s2">this systemic resilience of all of China</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.890" end="00:53:13.800" style="s2">it got hit by Wuhan but was able to not</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.070" end="00:53:15.390" style="s2">break as a total system and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.800" end="00:53:19.260" style="s2">was able to push the whole of China back</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.390" end="00:53:21.510" style="s2">down to the left-hand path okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.260" end="00:53:23.430" style="s2">so what&#39;s interesting about this is this</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.510" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">so much of this actually pivots on</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.430" end="00:53:28.140" style="s2">choice making so much as pivots at</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">associate and distributed cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.140" end="00:53:32.820" style="s2">cognitive level on our ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:35.310" style="s2">sense of what&#39;s happening clearly and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.820" end="00:53:37.410" style="s2">rapidly and they make effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.310" end="00:53:40.080" style="s2">in a timely fashion and with the right</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.410" end="00:53:41.220" style="s2">amount of impact to actually respond to</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.080" end="00:53:42.810" style="s2">what&#39;s happening but before we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.220" end="00:53:48.570" style="s2">overwhelmed by an exponentially growing</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.810" end="00:53:51.540" style="s2">curve I feel like that that that notion</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.570" end="00:53:52.680" style="s2">that insight of choice making response</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.540" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">all the way back to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.680" end="00:53:58.980" style="s2">were just having her so I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.120" style="s2">just actually recalling all that evil is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.980" end="00:54:03.930" style="s2">give me a mind what we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.120" end="00:54:07.740" style="s2">about I just thought we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.930" end="00:54:09.480" style="s2">about the fact that people you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.740" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">internalized the environment and the kit</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.480" end="00:54:12.980" style="s2">and we were sort of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.099" style="s2">possibility that what people will do</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.980" end="00:54:15.359" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.099" end="00:54:17.579" style="s2">they have something sort of analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.359" end="00:54:20.069" style="s2">a psychotic reaction to ice also noise</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.579" end="00:54:21.749" style="s2">and and you know and this is an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.069" end="00:54:25.079" style="s2">you said this is a way of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.749" end="00:54:28.950" style="s2">this notion of will right there finding</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.079" end="00:54:31.140" style="s2">meaning and and you know the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.950" end="00:54:33.869" style="s2">that what we&#39;ll see is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.140" end="00:54:35.729" style="s2">rapid possibly exponential growth of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.869" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">conspiracy theories and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.729" end="00:54:41.489" style="s2">things that divert resources and</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">problem-solving abilities and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.489" end="00:54:44.729" style="s2">distributed cognition and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:46.229" style="s2">labor okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.729" end="00:54:48.660" style="s2">ways that could be really exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.229" end="00:54:49.859" style="s2">eight things yeah okay so then so remap</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.660" end="00:54:53.190" style="s2">some of these notions so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.859" end="00:54:54.660" style="s2">mapping here of something like should be</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.190" end="00:54:56.549" style="s2">part of distribute cognition</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.660" end="00:54:58.140" style="s2">he says act okay that&#39;s it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.549" end="00:55:01.170" style="s2">key this is the important thing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.140" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">human beings are obligate tribal okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.170" end="00:55:07.859" style="s2">we are we are part of something yes and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">so for if we&#39;re not part of something we</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.859" end="00:55:12.569" style="s2">are drift yes and what&#39;s happening is is</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:14.249" style="s2">that whereas we as you as you exit is</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.569" end="00:55:16.549" style="s2">you take the red plate as you exit the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.249" end="00:55:20.549" style="s2">the tradition that is not working you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.549" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">you now are adrift and and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.549" end="00:55:24.950" style="s2">to which you&#39;re able to find something</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:27.779" style="s2">that you can be part of that is itself</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.950" end="00:55:29.309" style="s2">has the at least the ingredients to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.779" end="00:55:30.809" style="s2">adapted it may actually not initially be</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.309" end="00:55:33.210" style="s2">adapted but it has the annuity has the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.809" end="00:55:34.289" style="s2">capacity has the scope and competence to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.210" end="00:55:35.789" style="s2">actually be able to start making</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.289" end="00:55:37.380" style="s2">effective choices in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.789" end="00:55:39.469" style="s2">what&#39;s happening you will naturally</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.380" end="00:55:43.739" style="s2">begin to up gradient in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.469" end="00:55:45.989" style="s2">so okay how&#39;s that show up hmm I had</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.739" end="00:55:46.769" style="s2">like all right right sure to check it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.989" end="00:55:51.989" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.769" end="00:55:54.119" style="s2">where was this something happens</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.989" end="00:55:56.339" style="s2">somewhere where there was a crisis there</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.119" end="00:55:59.279" style="s2">was a town and in the town you had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.339" end="00:56:03.660" style="s2">political structure and oh it was during</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.279" end="00:56:05.069" style="s2">Katrina so Mississippi Katrina right the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.660" end="00:56:07.079" style="s2">you know hurricane his the leaders are</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.069" end="00:56:09.660" style="s2">breaking and the existing political</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.079" end="00:56:12.719" style="s2">structure just drops them all right</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.660" end="00:56:15.170" style="s2">right what happens is this one guy who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.719" end="00:56:18.539" style="s2">like the guy who runs the general store</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.170" end="00:56:20.339" style="s2">has his shit together and he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.539" end="00:56:22.200" style="s2">coordinate coordinate effective choices</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.339" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about local small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.200" end="00:56:27.170" style="s2">effective choices but that creates an</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.660" end="00:56:28.549" style="s2">attractor and of</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.170" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">people who swiftness that attractor</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.549" end="00:56:32.780" style="s2">they&#39;re like looking and they&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">chaos in all directions and they see one</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.780" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">spot over there there&#39;s not chaos in all</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:39.559" style="s2">directions and they begin to orient</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:41.809" style="s2">themselves towards that and so he says</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.559" end="00:56:43.190" style="s2">okay well you do this and they start</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.809" end="00:56:44.750" style="s2">doing that and as it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.190" end="00:56:47.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fuck that doesn&#39;t suck it works</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.750" end="00:56:49.220" style="s2">a little bit and and by the way been</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.059" end="00:56:53.359" style="s2">working with him it works better so then</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.220" end="00:56:56.900" style="s2">the zone of coordinated action the zone</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:57:00.170" style="s2">of order the zone of non chaos begins to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.900" end="00:57:02.030" style="s2">grow organically because we were that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.170" end="00:57:04.220" style="s2">obligate tribalism is that if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.030" end="00:57:08.000" style="s2">as individuals looner lose our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.220" end="00:57:10.130" style="s2">as individuals to see and orient towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.000" end="00:57:12.020" style="s2">what is truly effective choice in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.130" end="00:57:14.780" style="s2">context as long as we have that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.020" end="00:57:16.190" style="s2">which is our natural human mobility and</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.780" end="00:57:18.290" style="s2">then we have the capacity to orient</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.190" end="00:57:20.420" style="s2">ourselves to it in a flexible way so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.290" end="00:57:22.520" style="s2">that we can upgrade Ian its capacity</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.420" end="00:57:24.680" style="s2">then you get a positive feedback loop in</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.520" end="00:57:28.549" style="s2">the environment that you&#39;re in so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.680" end="00:57:30.799" style="s2">that liminal shamanic um we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.549" end="00:57:32.839" style="s2">with chaos all the time really and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">let&#39;s actually use that skill set to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.839" end="00:57:37.130" style="s2">Rico here something that is leaps all</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:38.900" style="s2">over it you know crosses the chasm you</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.130" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">know does the valley crossing into</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.900" end="00:57:44.750" style="s2">something that works right yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:46.790" style="s2">feels like this is a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.750" end="00:57:48.109" style="s2">prophecy I mean I think what we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.790" end="00:57:50.990" style="s2">to witness is that I think we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.109" end="00:57:54.500" style="s2">to witness in the West is a generalised</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.990" end="00:57:55.819" style="s2">failure of traditions institutional</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.500" end="00:57:58.339" style="s2">structures leadership as it currently</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.819" end="00:57:59.720" style="s2">exists for reasons both of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.339" end="00:58:03.319" style="s2">and ontological epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.720" end="00:58:06.200" style="s2">inadequacy right and the movement</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.319" end="00:58:07.220" style="s2">towards the collective intelligence to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.200" end="00:58:09.799" style="s2">move it towards distributed intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.220" end="00:58:11.180" style="s2">cognition binding those individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.799" end="00:58:12.710" style="s2">groups that are actually able to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.180" end="00:58:14.119" style="s2">increasingly effective choices in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.710" end="00:58:16.280" style="s2">context of what&#39;s really happening and</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.119" end="00:58:18.950" style="s2">then learning how to Rico here and we</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.280" end="00:58:20.180" style="s2">coordinate with those groups so that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.950" end="00:58:23.869" style="s2">they were able to scale and increase</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.180" end="00:58:26.540" style="s2">their effectiveness I would say is if</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.869" end="00:58:28.549" style="s2">not this time and I think this time is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.540" end="00:58:29.780" style="s2">good opportunity like it&#39;s a good trial</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.549" end="00:58:31.849" style="s2">run and it may be the one where that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.780" end="00:58:34.369" style="s2">happens if not this time it will be sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.849" end="00:58:38.410" style="s2">of in the next few times of this you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.369" end="00:58:38.410" style="s2">know this increase in Delta II mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.059" end="00:58:45.670" style="s2">human Yoko Sargon but there is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.089" end="00:58:47.799" style="s2">I see in that I mean that your prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.670" end="00:58:49.630" style="s2">I think your prophecy is accurate what I</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.799" end="00:58:52.299" style="s2">meant is cuz now I&#39;m thinking again of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.630" end="00:58:53.499" style="s2">other example if I&#39;m a republic ah it</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.299" end="00:58:55.119" style="s2">you get an int you get a group of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.499" end="00:58:57.549" style="s2">individuals who are locally very</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.119" end="00:58:59.079" style="s2">effective but it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.549" end="00:59:01.420" style="s2">global solution that they&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.079" end="00:59:03.609" style="s2">is actually while it ends up destroying</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.420" end="00:59:07.900" style="s2">Germany right it actually turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.609" end="00:59:11.140" style="s2">be massively self-destructive yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.900" end="00:59:14.109" style="s2">the so you clearly have individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.140" end="00:59:15.579" style="s2">on the on the street right and in in you</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.109" end="00:59:18.009" style="s2">know in the marketplace of Germany like</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.579" end="00:59:19.869" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.009" end="00:59:22.449" style="s2">that attractor of order that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.869" end="00:59:24.069" style="s2">that&#39;s why they succeed right there but</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.449" end="00:59:26.319" style="s2">what they do is that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.069" end="00:59:27.969" style="s2">configuration the dynamical system they</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.319" end="00:59:29.529" style="s2">engendered I mean this is kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.969" end="00:59:32.650" style="s2">know a version of the tragedy of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.529" end="00:59:34.930" style="s2">Commons right it&#39;s locally order</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.650" end="00:59:37.239" style="s2">generating but what it it&#39;s it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.930" end="00:59:39.579" style="s2">service again of this growth of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.239" end="00:59:42.009" style="s2">psychotic conspiracy theory that</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.579" end="00:59:44.140" style="s2">ultimately puts the whole you know the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.009" end="00:59:46.900" style="s2">whole country on a path of</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.140" end="00:59:47.799" style="s2">self-destruction yeah I think well I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.900" end="00:59:53.529" style="s2">think what we&#39;re gonna see is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.799" end="00:59:57.249" style="s2">gonna see something like a million Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.529" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">parties oh right I think I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.249" end="01:00:04.869" style="s2">gonna see is just lots and lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:06.699" style="s2">of micro psychotic cabal&#39;s yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.869" end="01:00:10.989" style="s2">and the question is going to be how do</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.699" end="01:00:14.199" style="s2">they relate to each other because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.989" end="01:00:18.189" style="s2">level of systemic breakdown is is you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.199" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">know the default state is failure so</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.189" end="01:00:22.239" style="s2">it&#39;s not like we need Nazis to fail it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:23.769" style="s2">more like we need something we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.239" end="01:00:26.699" style="s2">sort of the opposite of Nazis to succeed</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.769" end="01:00:31.869" style="s2">and the default state is failure right</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.699" end="01:00:33.809" style="s2">so what does that look like well it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.869" end="01:00:37.380" style="s2">looks a little bit like what Peter</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.809" end="01:00:40.029" style="s2">cultural r2 dot oh yeah yeah but but x</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.380" end="01:00:44.259" style="s2">yeah multiplied by a factor probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.029" end="01:00:46.660" style="s2">five orders of magnitude oh yeah so my</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.259" end="01:00:48.309" style="s2">concern there is then you you get you</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.660" end="01:00:51.219" style="s2">get general systems collapse because if</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.309" end="01:00:53.079" style="s2">you get this proliferation falls the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.219" end="01:00:54.730" style="s2">your internal social environment becomes</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.079" end="01:00:57.190" style="s2">as complex and unmanned</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.730" end="01:00:59.140" style="s2">as unmanageable as the external</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.190" end="01:01:03.790" style="s2">environment you&#39;re trying to respond to</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.140" end="01:01:07.060" style="s2">wow you know it&#39;s interesting in this</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.790" end="01:01:09.460" style="s2">case like something like a virus and</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.060" end="01:01:10.990" style="s2">here specifically nature may be our</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.460" end="01:01:13.540" style="s2">saving grace hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.990" end="01:01:18.520" style="s2">because if the if the if the complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.540" end="01:01:27.640" style="s2">is happening higher in the human social</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.520" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">stack so no politics finance it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.640" end="01:01:33.450" style="s2">sociology things like identity and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:37.240" style="s2">mimetics culture those are so easily I</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.450" end="01:01:38.650" style="s2">read this the next or amenable to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.240" end="01:01:40.450" style="s2">psychosis mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.650" end="01:01:41.770" style="s2">as long as I can tell a locally</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.450" end="01:01:43.180" style="s2">effective story that kind of makes me</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.770" end="01:01:46.119" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m making sense of my</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.180" end="01:01:47.500" style="s2">environment hiking I can kind of go</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.119" end="01:01:50.170" style="s2">forward until I bump into something</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.500" end="01:01:53.410" style="s2">nature doesn&#39;t give a fuck if my story</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.170" end="01:01:57.099" style="s2">is that it&#39;s funny I think it just</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.410" end="01:01:59.170" style="s2">happened actually in Iran a cleric you</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.099" end="01:02:00.940" style="s2">went to go admitted Minister some people</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.170" end="01:02:03.670" style="s2">who have got the virus and he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.940" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">take any precautions because his his his</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.670" end="01:02:08.230" style="s2">model was that he would be protected and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:09.849" style="s2">he got sick and died this isn&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.230" end="01:02:10.810" style="s2">what your psychotic story is like</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.849" end="01:02:12.670" style="s2">that&#39;sthat&#39;s rock-bottom</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.810" end="01:02:17.020" style="s2">instead I kind of break it hits rock</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.670" end="01:02:20.380" style="s2">bottom and so you know not being sick or</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.020" end="01:02:22.599" style="s2">not dying from sickness is like the kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.380" end="01:02:23.170" style="s2">that&#39;s look that that&#39;s it wow I forgot</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.599" end="01:02:25.030" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.170" end="01:02:27.940" style="s2">just a cute to check some of this whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.030" end="01:02:29.170" style="s2">story is is nature now the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.940" end="01:02:31.750" style="s2">day we&#39;re all running psychotic</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.170" end="01:02:33.339" style="s2">narratives the questions are they</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.750" end="01:02:36.130" style="s2">adaptive psychotic narratives or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.339" end="01:02:39.670" style="s2">right right so the more the crisis is</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.130" end="01:02:41.589" style="s2">that we run into our non sociological</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.670" end="01:02:44.800" style="s2">crises to protect natural actual natural</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.589" end="01:02:47.140" style="s2">crises that are missed sorrel so you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.800" end="01:02:49.869" style="s2">know climate change unfortunately until</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.140" end="01:02:52.450" style="s2">it is so intense that it&#39;s irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.869" end="01:02:54.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not visceral now you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.450" end="01:02:58.030" style="s2">everything you&#39;re seeing is mediated by</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.190" end="01:03:01.240" style="s2">a very large interpretive distance and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.030" end="01:03:05.220" style="s2">so you can always run a narrative in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.240" end="01:03:06.910" style="s2">between those two points yes and avoid</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.220" end="01:03:09.520" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.910" end="01:03:10.599" style="s2">rock-bottom yeah in to hit you in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.520" end="01:03:13.020" style="s2">face with something that you can&#39;t avoid</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.599" end="01:03:15.369" style="s2">no matter what there was something like</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.020" end="01:03:17.410" style="s2">getting sick and dying from a virus</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.369" end="01:03:19.270" style="s2">that&#39;s growing very rapidly you know if</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.410" end="01:03:21.089" style="s2">you take a look at it every one of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.270" end="01:03:23.589" style="s2">micro cabal&#39;s of psycho psychotics</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.089" end="01:03:26.130" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get sick if this is real</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.589" end="01:03:28.510" style="s2">like this is or there&#39;s a real thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.130" end="01:03:32.280" style="s2">where specifically their local</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.510" end="01:03:35.680" style="s2">adaptiveness will be somewhat obviously</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.280" end="01:03:37.480" style="s2">less than others now what you&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.680" end="01:03:41.200" style="s2">to say I think it&#39;s certainly up into my</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.480" end="01:03:43.150" style="s2">mind is they you know hardcore prepper</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.200" end="01:03:46.420" style="s2">communities are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.150" end="01:03:47.859" style="s2">indistinguishable from groups are</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.420" end="01:03:49.210" style="s2">actually making effective choices you</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.859" end="01:03:51.609" style="s2">know in a larger context like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.210" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">whole bunch of nodes uh-huh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.609" end="01:03:55.020" style="s2">whole bunch of solutions to this</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:57.220" style="s2">particular event that are probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.020" end="01:04:00.190" style="s2">equivalent in terms of their</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.220" end="01:04:02.200" style="s2">adaptiveness unless the event is really</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.190" end="01:04:04.210" style="s2">big right and so it&#39;s weird like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.200" end="01:04:06.039" style="s2">one of these things where I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.210" end="01:04:08.440" style="s2">as I&#39;m talking like wow it would</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.039" end="01:04:10.539" style="s2">actually maybe be best for us if this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.440" end="01:04:13.809" style="s2">a bigger thing then it seems like it</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.539" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">might be because it would be a enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.809" end="01:04:21.640" style="s2">felt reality that it would push our</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:23.500" style="s2">consciousness past certain black holes</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.640" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">that were in right now so more like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.500" end="01:04:30.910" style="s2">Bronze Age collapse yeah which article</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:33.789" style="s2">right you get this PC ation of all these</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.910" end="01:04:36.220" style="s2">noose you know cultural economic</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.789" end="01:04:40.329" style="s2">political forms of organization and</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.220" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">cognition changes fundamentally yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.329" end="01:04:44.079" style="s2">fact if you think about it like if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:46.569" style="s2">think okay so we can go up you can say</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.079" end="01:04:48.309" style="s2">the Chinese went through that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.569" end="01:04:50.109" style="s2">dynamic what seven times like every</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.309" end="01:04:51.400" style="s2">every dynasty has gone through a</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.109" end="01:04:54.789" style="s2">collapse that was on the order of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.400" end="01:04:57.160" style="s2">two-thirds mortality right in a couple</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.789" end="01:04:58.569" style="s2">hundred years of chaos and then that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.160" end="01:05:00.339" style="s2">gave rise to the next dynasty it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.569" end="01:05:01.660" style="s2">because the continuity of China which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.339" end="01:05:03.609" style="s2">different than the discontinuity of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.660" end="01:05:07.150" style="s2">Bronze Age I think is precisely that</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.609" end="01:05:08.920" style="s2">more term attitude though is we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.150" end="01:05:10.029" style="s2">some sixty percent to seventy five</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.920" end="01:05:11.829" style="s2">percent or something like that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.029" end="01:05:14.799" style="s2">probably have no longer China to China</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.829" end="01:05:15.369" style="s2">you have something which is you know the</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.799" end="01:05:19.150" style="s2">Hittites</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.369" end="01:05:20.260" style="s2">to the Greeks yeah and then on the so</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.150" end="01:05:20.740" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got like the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.260" end="01:05:23.109" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.740" end="01:05:24.910" style="s2">the Chinese collapse the Roman collapse</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.109" end="01:05:27.339" style="s2">and then like the Black Plague something</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.910" end="01:05:29.140" style="s2">like that or the Black Plague awful as</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.339" end="01:05:30.540" style="s2">it was didn&#39;t really interrupt the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.140" end="01:05:33.369" style="s2">continuity of the West</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.540" end="01:05:34.330" style="s2">it created a real the thing that came</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.369" end="01:05:37.330" style="s2">out the other end was very very</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.330" end="01:05:39.849" style="s2">different but I would say and deeply</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.330" end="01:05:41.650" style="s2">fundamentally was still still thought of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.849" end="01:05:43.540" style="s2">itself as the West at least yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.650" end="01:05:45.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuity of I there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.280" end="01:06:15.310" style="s2">question is how hard do we have to hit</p>

<p begin="01:06:18.460" end="01:06:23.770" style="s2">that we need to make in our interior and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.130" end="01:06:25.230" style="s2">our exterior to be truly adaptive to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.770" end="01:06:28.750" style="s2">context that we&#39;re finding ourselves in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.230" end="01:06:30.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.750" end="01:06:30.990" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.980" end="01:06:37.990" style="s2">so I mean it&#39;s something that comes up</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.560" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">into a mind it&#39;s not a direct logical</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.990" end="01:06:41.950" style="s2">following from this but what we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:45.490" style="s2">said but I was like I&#39;m seeing this</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.950" end="01:06:47.260" style="s2">picture now of groups of people who like</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.490" end="01:06:49.050" style="s2">do the basically do the learned</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.260" end="01:06:52.990" style="s2">helplessness and they just try to escape</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.050" end="01:06:54.480" style="s2">mm-hmm right and then we have the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.990" end="01:06:56.890" style="s2">proliferation of the cabal&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.480" end="01:07:00.150" style="s2">which is is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.890" end="01:07:07.750" style="s2">experimental psychosis right and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.150" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">right but but there seems to be and so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.750" end="01:07:12.930" style="s2">get that I think that&#39;s good there seems</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">to be in another psychological dimension</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.930" end="01:07:17.740" style="s2">that&#39;s at work here and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:20.349" style="s2">it fits in here but I thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.740" end="01:07:21.550" style="s2">when you were mentioning something and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.349" end="01:07:23.170" style="s2">want to be really carefully because I</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.550" end="01:07:26.349" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I miss it miss attributing</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.170" end="01:07:28.359" style="s2">so grain of salt on this but remember</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.349" end="01:07:31.570" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about how the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.359" end="01:07:32.950" style="s2">thing about climate change is you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.570" end="01:07:34.510" style="s2">this displacement right this</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.950" end="01:07:36.940" style="s2">displacement issue that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.510" end="01:07:39.250" style="s2">people to defer right they so basically</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.940" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">they have deferral strategies of denying</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.250" end="01:07:44.140" style="s2">or right or mitigating or reducing</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:48.850" style="s2">response because it&#39;s displaced right</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.140" end="01:07:50.290" style="s2">and I again this is looks right now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.850" end="01:07:53.410" style="s2">anecdotal I don&#39;t have any data nobody</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.290" end="01:07:55.570" style="s2">would have to hear on this yet but it it</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.410" end="01:07:57.250" style="s2">seems to me that there&#39;s a I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.570" end="01:07:59.080" style="s2">to call it pleasure but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.250" end="01:08:01.980" style="s2">something about this being concrete and</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.080" end="01:08:05.680" style="s2">present that is alleviating for people</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.980" end="01:08:10.210" style="s2">that it takes the miasma of the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.680" end="01:08:13.020" style="s2">crisis and puts a concrete agent face on</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.210" end="01:08:17.500" style="s2">it that we ask few things about and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.020" end="01:08:18.910" style="s2">right and so part I want to be really</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.500" end="01:08:22.720" style="s2">cautious here and I know you you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.910" end="01:08:26.230" style="s2">you respect that but part of the part of</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.720" end="01:08:32.170" style="s2">the reason why I think also you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.230" end="01:08:33.940" style="s2">getting the panic well this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.170" end="01:08:36.009" style="s2">an ideal idea that goes back to Tillich</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.940" end="01:08:38.440" style="s2">and from one of the things people do</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.009" end="01:08:40.540" style="s2">with anxiety is they try to transmute it</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.440" end="01:08:43.900" style="s2">into fear because if they can transmute</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.540" end="01:08:46.380" style="s2">anxiety into fear then they can do</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.900" end="01:08:52.299" style="s2">something as opposed to just have that</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.380" end="01:08:56.140" style="s2">of ambiguity and man that is an intense</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.299" end="01:08:57.430" style="s2">notion mmm-hmm one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.140" end="01:09:02.770" style="s2">people do with anxiety is they</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.430" end="01:09:04.930" style="s2">transmuted into fear Wow and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.770" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">in-depth and and that could that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.930" end="01:09:09.330" style="s2">feeds into the conspiracy generation</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:11.470" style="s2">because what conspiracies do as</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.330" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">psychological adaptive mechanisms is</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.470" end="01:09:16.600" style="s2">they translate existential anxiety into</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:19.540" style="s2">actionable fear because now there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.600" end="01:09:22.180" style="s2">threat whatever as the Cabal which which</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.540" end="01:09:24.339" style="s2">how it works however overwhelming is at</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.180" end="01:09:27.009" style="s2">least concrete enough that in principle</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.339" end="01:09:28.120" style="s2">agency is possible so you know I</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.009" end="01:09:30.370" style="s2">sometimes call this the demonization</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.120" end="01:09:32.620" style="s2">strategy one of the ways you know it I</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.370" end="01:09:35.140" style="s2">sometimes say to people I mean this sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.620" end="01:09:37.089" style="s2">of how ironically it would be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.140" end="01:09:38.589" style="s2">wonderful if there was a devil it would</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.089" end="01:09:40.870" style="s2">be wonderful if all of the evil and</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.589" end="01:09:43.750" style="s2">suffering actually had you know an</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.870" end="01:09:46.480" style="s2">orchestrated genius behind it because</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.750" end="01:09:48.090" style="s2">then at last we could know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.480" end="01:09:50.820" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.090" end="01:09:52.350" style="s2">yeah very clearly we&#39;ve turned it from</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.820" end="01:09:54.450" style="s2">an ill-defined problem into a</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.350" end="01:09:56.280" style="s2">well-defined problem it&#39;s a hard problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.450" end="01:10:01.200" style="s2">but you know what it&#39;s not anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.280" end="01:10:05.310" style="s2">not an ill-defined problem right so how</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.200" end="01:10:08.280" style="s2">do you know you&#39;re not in the Cabal yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.310" end="01:10:10.860" style="s2">how do we how do we go about as</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.280" end="01:10:13.530" style="s2">individuals navigate these chalk</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.860" end="01:10:15.390" style="s2">navigating these choppy waters well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.530" end="01:10:18.930" style="s2">wondering if that&#39;s I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.390" end="01:10:20.040" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things I mean so a few</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.930" end="01:10:23.940" style="s2">minutes ago you&#39;re talking about a kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.040" end="01:10:26.220" style="s2">of wisdom we need in order to write sure</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.940" end="01:10:29.970" style="s2">we&#39;re going down the left-hand as you as</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.220" end="01:10:32.100" style="s2">you put it I&#39;m suggesting to you that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.970" end="01:10:36.030" style="s2">part of that wisdom might be the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.100" end="01:10:39.270" style="s2">self knowledge of this modal kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.030" end="01:10:41.220" style="s2">self-deception and one of the so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.270" end="01:10:43.320" style="s2">aware that I&#39;m doing a lot of shifting</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.220" end="01:10:45.990" style="s2">of anxiety interfered that from me is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.320" end="01:10:48.510" style="s2">red flag that forget what flag I love it</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.990" end="01:10:51.510" style="s2">right a red flag that I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.510" end="01:10:53.280" style="s2">getting into conspiratorial Kabbalistic</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.510" end="01:10:56.850" style="s2">gnostic in the pejorative sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.280" end="01:10:57.750" style="s2">word kind of thinking right yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.850" end="01:10:59.850" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.750" end="01:11:01.740" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting I&#39;m loving the</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.850" end="01:11:04.020" style="s2">the inverse where the Black Plague broke</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.740" end="01:11:08.100" style="s2">the religion that was a religion yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.020" end="01:11:10.290" style="s2">and this this new thing is is what gives</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.100" end="01:11:12.510" style="s2">rise to the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.290" end="01:11:15.270" style="s2">religion you just you just described one</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.510" end="01:11:19.530" style="s2">you know one piece one one wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.270" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">is it a college homily no a reading</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.530" end="01:11:22.140" style="s2">right or reading a reading from the book</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:25.920" style="s2">of the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.140" end="01:11:27.960" style="s2">chapter 7 verse 3 if you notice that</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.920" end="01:11:31.190" style="s2">you&#39;re shifting anxiety into fear then</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.960" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a red flag yeah that&#39;s a red flag</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.190" end="01:11:41.460" style="s2">and then the converse would be not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:44.100" style="s2">teaching people amelioration of anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.460" end="01:11:45.690" style="s2">that&#39;s a good you need something more</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.100" end="01:11:49.430" style="s2">like what we saw happen after the Black</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.690" end="01:11:51.450" style="s2">Plague week you again the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.430" end="01:11:53.040" style="s2">identification of your interior life</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.450" end="01:11:55.020" style="s2">it&#39;s fun the grammar of that has</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.040" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">fundamentally changed it would have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.020" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">be something more like in that there are</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:01.889" style="s2">more deep so deeper into the guts of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:04.860" style="s2">psyche</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.889" end="01:12:07.320" style="s2">response to uncertainty and dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.860" end="01:12:09.510" style="s2">change is something other than anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.320" end="01:12:12.809" style="s2">and we all but it has to be well no no</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.510" end="01:12:16.679" style="s2">we&#39;ve reconfigured the grammar before we</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.809" end="01:12:18.360" style="s2">have done this multiple times so so one</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.679" end="01:12:19.829" style="s2">is you know first of all perhaps the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.360" end="01:12:23.130" style="s2">first step is well am i translating</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.829" end="01:12:25.979" style="s2">anxiety into fear right well that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.130" end="01:12:28.439" style="s2">but another one is can I get deeper than</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.979" end="01:12:30.510" style="s2">the response of anxiety and come up with</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.439" end="01:12:32.699" style="s2">something other than anxiety as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.510" end="01:12:33.869" style="s2">response to uncertainty oh it&#39;s so good</p>

<p begin="01:12:49.439" end="01:12:56.130" style="s2">proposition it&#39;s a cultivated sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.649" end="01:12:58.610" style="s2">being uh like having a participatory</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.130" end="01:13:00.929" style="s2">conformity with an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.610" end="01:13:03.119" style="s2">transformative process in reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.929" end="01:13:05.909" style="s2">continuity of contact rather than</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.119" end="01:13:07.559" style="s2">closure into conclusion right boys</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.909" end="01:13:09.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a bunch of good words man so</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.559" end="01:13:11.669" style="s2">there&#39;s a ten time stamp whatever this</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.630" end="01:13:13.530" style="s2">is right now that was uh that was it</p>

<p begin="01:13:13.530" end="01:13:18.239" style="s2">yeah the the visual image I have is of</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.809" end="01:13:20.039" style="s2">like a buoy in the ocean that has you</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.239" end="01:13:24.119" style="s2">know it just it&#39;s weighted such that</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.039" end="01:13:26.969" style="s2">even as the water I was having a sailing</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.119" end="01:13:29.429" style="s2">imagery the person who can sort of can</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.969" end="01:13:31.679" style="s2">ride the edge of the storm a family</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.429" end="01:13:33.539" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s you don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.679" end="01:13:35.429" style="s2">swamped right that&#39;s the key yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.539" end="01:13:37.649" style="s2">you know having a series of capacities</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.429" end="01:13:39.389" style="s2">and abilities including the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.649" end="01:13:42.090" style="s2">just sort of like surrender to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.389" end="01:13:44.159" style="s2">happening so that you&#39;re not breaking as</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.090" end="01:13:46.260" style="s2">the system pushes on you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.159" end="01:13:49.019" style="s2">actually able to just keep that that all</p>

<p begin="01:13:51.899" end="01:13:53.729" style="s2">that if you&#39;re out of there you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.340" end="01:13:55.199" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.729" end="01:13:58.439" style="s2">and if you&#39;re in there you can at least</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.199" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">recover all right the penny if you if</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.439" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">the wave if the winds died down a little</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:06.479" style="s2">bit you&#39;re back into the salient yep</p>

<p begin="01:14:08.699" end="01:14:14.790" style="s2">Joseph Conrad about a ship that gets</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.800" end="01:14:16.200" style="s2">swamped and the sailors are all Stan</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.790" end="01:14:18.540" style="s2">are sort of holding onto the side of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.200" end="01:14:19.920" style="s2">ship it&#39;s actually been swamped and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.540" end="01:14:22.230" style="s2">Alliston the captain</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.920" end="01:14:24.030" style="s2">he&#39;s just they&#39;re all watching him good</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.230" end="01:14:25.710" style="s2">they have a they have a kind of they</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.030" end="01:14:27.060" style="s2">have a faith in him but he&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.710" end="01:14:28.500" style="s2">and he&#39;s watching and he&#39;s watching and</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.060" end="01:14:30.270" style="s2">then all of a sudden goes okay now raise</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.500" end="01:14:32.040" style="s2">that sail that sail that sail and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.270" end="01:14:34.560" style="s2">he goes right timing of wind and wave</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.040" end="01:14:37.260" style="s2">and the shipwrights there you go</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.560" end="01:14:38.790" style="s2">so he like he represents exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.260" end="01:14:40.950" style="s2">buoy right he was young he was aware</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.790" end="01:14:44.220" style="s2">that he even being swamped is not being</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.950" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">swamped yes yes yeah all in all it</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.220" end="01:14:47.640" style="s2">seemed like all was lost but as long as</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:49.470" style="s2">the captain has got their eye on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.640" end="01:14:51.000" style="s2">wind you know that you have a chance and</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.470" end="01:14:52.230" style="s2">they knew long as he had his eye on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.000" end="01:14:54.120" style="s2">winds that they had a chance and so they</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.230" end="01:14:59.430" style="s2">stayed together in pop and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.120" end="01:15:00.690" style="s2">it that&#39;s a great story yeah hmm yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.430" end="01:15:01.350" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s funny cuz so he didn&#39;t do is</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.690" end="01:15:03.360" style="s2">he didn&#39;t lose faith</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.350" end="01:15:05.370" style="s2">he didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t fall and to</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.360" end="01:15:07.620" style="s2">learned helplessness or neuroses and he</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.370" end="01:15:10.260" style="s2">stated he wasn&#39;t just doing willful</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.620" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">assertion he&#39;s not a Rambo hero right</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.260" end="01:15:13.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the point</p>
