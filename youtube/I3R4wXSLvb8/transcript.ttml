<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:04.830" style="s2">listening as a podcast remember to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:08.580" style="s2">subscribe and hit the bell to track</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:12.120" style="s2">upcoming releases yeah okay so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.580" end="00:00:15.570" style="s2">really nice to sit with you all here the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">Sun is in a different place for many of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.570" end="00:00:20.100" style="s2">us but it seems like there&#39;s still some</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">light color coming through your room :</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.100" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">at least is there a bit um I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">actually bought some nice lighting right</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:30.090" style="s2">before I right before I went into</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:33.239" style="s2">quarantine because I&#39;m going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.090" end="00:00:42.680" style="s2">recording some videos so so that is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.239" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">natural light yeah so you know it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.680" end="00:00:49.469" style="s2">intention with this really above all</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">that this is an opportunity for us to to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.469" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">talk with each other</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">and really just to be here we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">recording this and I hope is that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:01.730" style="s2">will be helpful and interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">people and beneficial in some way but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.730" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">always wonder if having that as an</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.460" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">objective is in some sense putting the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">cart before the horse maybe they come</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">together suppose it wouldn&#39;t be a horse</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:13.670" style="s2">and cart if you didn&#39;t happen both so</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a funny expression in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.670" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">but the the place I always find myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">in when we when we begin to talk like</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">this with an intention to tune in and be</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">with each other to go a bit deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">to engage in a process of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:39.439" style="s2">is a real gratitude for the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:44.420" style="s2">and I noticed a a change in my body and</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.439" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">and bine and there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.420" end="00:01:55.980" style="s2">that thing is what I&#39;m most in service</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:02:01.650" style="s2">of here because it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.980" end="00:02:03.330" style="s2">Union and somehow begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.650" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">comprehending what is occurring in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.330" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">world at the moment and we can all of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">sudden reveal a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">existential themes and very real</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.580" end="00:02:18.570" style="s2">possibilities that were seeing manifest</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">in the collective psyche at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.570" end="00:02:24.110" style="s2">and fear many of us are experiencing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.950" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">so fundamentally what comes first here</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.300" end="00:02:36.990" style="s2">is this we we are together and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">sharing of this for anyone to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.990" end="00:02:45.230" style="s2">is something that you know you all as</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:50.330" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned have a say in so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.230" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">here and now is prime I mean for me and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.330" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">you know with that said that we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:03:01.140" style="s2">begin by very briefly introducing who we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:06.690" style="s2">are and it could be as simple as this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.140" end="00:03:11.100" style="s2">my name the interest I suppose you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.690" end="00:03:13.730" style="s2">in being here and engaging in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.100" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">conversation I should say that part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.730" end="00:03:20.489" style="s2">what we&#39;ll be doing here is going</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:24.000" style="s2">through a seeking to make sense of -</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.489" end="00:03:25.950" style="s2">something a doctor Dan Hall has put</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.000" end="00:03:31.230" style="s2">together called situational assessment</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.950" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">right now which is a well at an</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.230" end="00:03:37.110" style="s2">assessment of various aspects of I meant</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">a crisis that we are facing and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.110" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">interrelated self crises that may be</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:47.040" style="s2">upon us as triggered by this coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">event but it&#39;s not all doom and gloom</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.040" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">there&#39;s very much opportunity as well</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">and so this is both sides I hope we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">realize it together so Peter perhaps if</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t mind saying if he thinks to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">introduce how you feeling and who you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m a Peter Limburg I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">pretty just very grounded right now and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">just like excited being here with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:28.610" style="s2">all and I don&#39;t really know how to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">introduce myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s via my podcast and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:38.250" style="s2">podcast host for the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:40.919" style="s2">explorers podcast and I think I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.250" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">guests on everyone&#39;s podcast here both</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.919" end="00:04:49.860" style="s2">Ann Zion 2.0 and then voice club now</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">voice craft and were whatever or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.860" end="00:04:55.110" style="s2">space that were collectively in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:57.720" style="s2">sense making web whatever I feel a sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.110" end="00:05:07.169" style="s2">of philia with with you all so I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">to be here I&#39;ll take Colin Oh next yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.169" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a real pleasure to be here I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:13.140" style="s2">just thinking Peter when you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:16.790" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been a guest on all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.140" end="00:05:19.970" style="s2">podcasts I just started having like</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.790" end="00:05:22.890" style="s2">flashes of memories that are mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.970" end="00:05:25.729" style="s2">auditory because I&#39;ve listened to all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.890" end="00:05:30.830" style="s2">your podcasts too and there&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.729" end="00:05:33.000" style="s2">this flash of different memories of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.830" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">conversations snippets of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.000" end="00:05:41.580" style="s2">and yeah I never really knew why I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:46.169" style="s2">started that podcast in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:50.070" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about this moment</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.169" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">that feels like an invitation to find a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.070" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">little more clarity about what that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:06:00.450" style="s2">but for right now just dropping in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">talking with you guys feels good I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.450" end="00:06:07.380" style="s2">been feeling anxious I&#39;ve been feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:15.240" style="s2">ecstatic at times I&#39;ve been feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.380" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">grateful confused and I actually didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.240" end="00:06:20.780" style="s2">read the situational assessment on</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:25.660" style="s2">purpose because I wanted to come in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.780" end="00:06:28.190" style="s2">with the person with with questions so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.660" end="00:06:31.370" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m happy to be here thanks to</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.210" end="00:06:57.140" style="s2">don&#39;t know I think I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.250" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">said it publicly but I always kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.140" end="00:07:02.270" style="s2">consider us like sister podcasts I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:05.020" style="s2">know why that phrase comes up but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.270" end="00:07:10.490" style="s2">it that&#39;s how I categorized all of y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.020" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s just uh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:17.150" style="s2">reservoir of fluency and rapport that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:19.370" style="s2">has been established personally and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.150" end="00:07:21.290" style="s2">through the appreciation of all of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.370" end="00:07:25.760" style="s2">different podcasts that&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.290" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">really a fun fun foundation to to push</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.760" end="00:07:39.950" style="s2">off from so excited to see where this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">heads out Amen sister yes yeah yes I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:51.260" style="s2">co-host both have podcast with Jared</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.979" end="00:07:53.090" style="s2">over here and let&#39;s see how I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.260" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">feeling well I just moved into a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.090" end="00:07:57.610" style="s2">house last week and so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:08:01.550" style="s2">changes of course the situation we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.610" end="00:08:06.350" style="s2">is provoking a lot of thoughts some</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.550" end="00:08:08.540" style="s2">anxieties but also kind of a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.350" end="00:08:10.370" style="s2">inevitability that like you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.540" end="00:08:13.430" style="s2">in the sense making space we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.370" end="00:08:15.470" style="s2">talking about existential risks and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.430" end="00:08:17.510" style="s2">meta-crisis and all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.470" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">coming down the pike and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.510" end="00:08:20.990" style="s2">theoretical and now it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:23.240" style="s2">theoretical anymore it&#39;s not quite well</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.990" end="00:08:25.460" style="s2">we you know there was a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.240" end="00:08:27.260" style="s2">things that could you know could have</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.460" end="00:08:28.910" style="s2">happened and could keep happening and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.260" end="00:08:30.890" style="s2">now it&#39;s happening and so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.910" end="00:08:31.209" style="s2">sense of inevitability of like okay here</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.890" end="00:08:33.159" style="s2">we go</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.209" end="00:08:36.579" style="s2">you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.159" end="00:08:39.250" style="s2">pretty bad but it&#39;s not as bad as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.579" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">think what&#39;s coming like this it might</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.250" end="00:08:43.810" style="s2">be a domino effect but I think with</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:46.629" style="s2">ecological crisis it&#39;s gonna be much</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.810" end="00:08:49.029" style="s2">much worse than this and and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.629" end="00:08:50.730" style="s2">a great opportunity to get ready to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.029" end="00:08:54.129" style="s2">ourselves resilient to get ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.730" end="00:08:56.410" style="s2">coordinated to sense make all of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.129" end="00:08:58.060" style="s2">things that you know this for me this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.410" end="00:09:00.269" style="s2">like the training ground so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.060" end="00:09:06.040" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m coming into this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.269" end="00:09:13.060" style="s2">this meeting here today yeah beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.040" end="00:09:16.420" style="s2">so the next up here is two on the go a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.060" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">bit of the meditation together so Jared</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.420" end="00:09:26.379" style="s2">I believe sure yeah yeah all right so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:28.829" style="s2">guess the first step is always to see if</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.379" end="00:09:37.029" style="s2">we can sit up straight get our spines</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.829" end="00:09:39.009" style="s2">nice and elongated and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.029" end="00:09:41.970" style="s2">just about right around five minutes is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.009" end="00:09:41.970" style="s2">that cool - yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.620" end="00:09:53.310" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s just start by closing</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.660" end="00:09:59.620" style="s2">our eyes to get a couple deep breaths</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.310" end="00:10:03.790" style="s2">and I like to always settle into things</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.620" end="00:10:08.310" style="s2">by breathing into my my chest my heart</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.790" end="00:10:10.480" style="s2">center I&#39;m gonna fill it up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.310" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">maybe even with a little bit of a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.480" end="00:10:20.920" style="s2">of gratitude for each of those breaths</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:24.670" style="s2">that we are able to have and then when</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.920" end="00:10:28.360" style="s2">some of this you start to feel into what</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.670" end="00:10:33.069" style="s2">this gratitude feels like make those out</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.360" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">breaths about giving it away any</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.069" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">reservation just releasing it completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">for others</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.500" end="00:10:55.550" style="s2">and then receive it now I want to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.150" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">us on a bit of a exploration of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.550" end="00:11:01.570" style="s2">experience and maybe in some spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:05.660" style="s2">are alive for a lot of us right now so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.570" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">let&#39;s start by bringing our awareness to</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.660" end="00:11:15.260" style="s2">what we hear and not only what we hear</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:20.390" style="s2">but where it&#39;s located so you&#39;ll hear my</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.260" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">voice very close right in your ear maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.390" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear some ambient noises of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:35.030" style="s2">room or from outside the house each one</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">of them has their own location you see</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.030" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">how far your sense of space can expand</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:59.420" style="s2">using those cues of noise sound to build</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.590" end="00:12:01.070" style="s2">it now see if just for a moment instead</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.420" end="00:12:05.240" style="s2">of concentrating on the sounds you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.070" end="00:12:13.850" style="s2">just contact the space in between all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.240" end="00:12:16.100" style="s2">these sounds and sensations and as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.850" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">do that let&#39;s start pulling our focus</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.100" end="00:12:20.380" style="s2">and a little bit closer to our body</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.590" end="00:12:30.520" style="s2">until we get a good sense of the empty</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:30.520" style="s2">space around us where that barrier is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.780" end="00:12:44.120" style="s2">now maybe it&#39;s very gently just bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:48.829" style="s2">our attention to our abdomen area our</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.120" end="00:12:52.429" style="s2">gut and see if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.829" end="00:12:57.110" style="s2">sensations to notice here maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.429" end="00:13:01.249" style="s2">constriction maybe not if there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.110" end="00:13:16.009" style="s2">something there see if you can find its</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.249" end="00:13:27.470" style="s2">boundaries see if it has any movement be</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.009" end="00:13:30.649" style="s2">with that for a moment now it&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.470" end="00:13:37.189" style="s2">that attention and gently start bringing</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.649" end="00:13:39.970" style="s2">it up to our heart center see what we</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.189" end="00:13:59.619" style="s2">can feel there so you can feel a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.970" end="00:13:59.619" style="s2">solidness a wholeheartedness deads now</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.679" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">after sitting with this this heart</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:08.319" style="s2">feeling whatever it is maybe it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:10.850" style="s2">feeling maybe it&#39;s an absence of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.319" end="00:14:16.970" style="s2">or you can&#39;t quite detect something</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.850" end="00:14:20.799" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but slowly as we wrap things</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.970" end="00:14:26.569" style="s2">up on this short exploration of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.799" end="00:14:30.829" style="s2">experience let&#39;s try and stay in contact</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.569" end="00:14:34.360" style="s2">with our heart because I know we all</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.829" end="00:14:37.040" style="s2">have a lot of time to spend in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.360" end="00:14:39.309" style="s2">but let&#39;s try and bring some heart as</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.040" end="00:14:39.309" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:47.529" style="s2">maybe just slowly opening your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.339" end="00:14:52.950" style="s2">you&#39;re just letting a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.529" end="00:14:56.220" style="s2">light in and then a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.950" end="00:14:59.279" style="s2">keeping this contact with the heart</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.220" end="00:15:04.570" style="s2">maybe even acting from it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.279" end="00:15:12.190" style="s2">what would that feel like now we open</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.570" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">our eyes fully ready move forward I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.190" end="00:15:14.220" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:28.060" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:44.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.310" end="00:15:47.370" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.649" end="00:15:56.709" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:34.230" style="s2">so thank you yeah yeah thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.569" end="00:16:34.230" style="s2">indulging me on our little trip well</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.910" end="00:16:50.410" style="s2">something that really struck me then and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.430" end="00:16:53.740" style="s2">this no new thing to be struck by is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.410" end="00:17:01.689" style="s2">different departure points or launch</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.740" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">points or ways our body mind heart the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.689" end="00:17:09.819" style="s2">whole thing feels when we begin to step</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:15.970" style="s2">in again to communication or step in</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.819" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">again to an intention an action which</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.970" end="00:17:25.689" style="s2">now is catalyzing something else and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">there&#39;s something so interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.689" end="00:17:35.559" style="s2">that the individual phenomenology of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:41.399" style="s2">and how that couples with the social</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.559" end="00:17:44.909" style="s2">effect of it and I wonder also it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.399" end="00:17:47.559" style="s2">importance of its relation to our</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.909" end="00:17:52.840" style="s2">collective sense making of our present</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.559" end="00:17:56.220" style="s2">moment and fundamentally be the actions</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.840" end="00:18:05.080" style="s2">that may or may not be taken</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.220" end="00:18:08.409" style="s2">collectively so that we might what then</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.080" end="00:18:13.059" style="s2">we begin to characterize what we might</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.409" end="00:18:16.049" style="s2">wish to be the case and I say we could</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.059" end="00:18:24.370" style="s2">come together to make a decent</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.049" end="00:18:25.210" style="s2">characterization of that a world of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.370" end="00:18:32.039" style="s2">kind of content</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.210" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">that enables potential to be furthered</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.039" end="00:18:38.399" style="s2">development to be furthered connection</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:44.140" style="s2">to be deepened being to be appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.399" end="00:18:48.929" style="s2">loved to be felt and shared and all</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.140" end="00:18:54.070" style="s2">together what matters in life to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.929" end="00:19:04.149" style="s2">continue and open itself into the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.070" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">in a way that we can be in integrity</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.149" end="00:19:25.320" style="s2">with we can feel some sort of trust in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:27.880" style="s2">and I notice in myself every day how I</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.320" end="00:19:31.539" style="s2">respond to situations in ways which do</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.880" end="00:19:35.140" style="s2">not necessarily create the outcomes that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.539" end="00:19:37.059" style="s2">a higher part of me or a more connected</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.140" end="00:19:43.500" style="s2">part of me a more stoic part of me</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.059" end="00:19:43.500" style="s2">perhaps visa may may wish to see and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.279" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">that&#39;s something that fascinates me</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.419" end="00:19:53.680" style="s2">about these</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2">of communication and I I I&#39;d ask our</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.680" end="00:20:03.430" style="s2">listeners to really feel and tune into</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:06.100" style="s2">because it does seem to be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.430" end="00:20:08.700" style="s2">a communicating from a more grounded</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.100" end="00:20:11.410" style="s2">centered place</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.700" end="00:20:13.330" style="s2">Jared Jim mentioned the heart what is it</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.410" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">like just to speak and be anchored from</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.330" end="00:20:23.980" style="s2">there what is it a like like to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:25.540" style="s2">centered aligned in touch with what a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.980" end="00:20:29.800" style="s2">good the true and the beautiful that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.540" end="00:20:35.110" style="s2">can be so lovely not so easy but there</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.800" end="00:20:42.810" style="s2">seems to be a more towards a direction</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.110" end="00:20:42.810" style="s2">of that and then more of reactivity and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.050" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">and so mind then I to begin talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.100" end="00:21:04.560" style="s2">about systemic things in the world how</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:17.500" style="s2">do you feel we could begin to bite into</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.560" end="00:21:23.110" style="s2">all of that when they just say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.500" end="00:21:25.750" style="s2">to kind of anchor a bit of why I chose</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.110" end="00:21:29.740" style="s2">that those specific areas to pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.750" end="00:21:31.300" style="s2">attention to when you guys asked if I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.740" end="00:21:33.070" style="s2">would be interested in hosting something</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.300" end="00:21:36.990" style="s2">I think it was this morning because this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.070" end="00:21:39.070" style="s2">came together pretty quick i sat with</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.990" end="00:21:41.170" style="s2">someone certainty for a bit of what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.070" end="00:21:44.890" style="s2">was going to say or what would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.170" end="00:21:47.100" style="s2">interesting and then noticed that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.890" end="00:21:49.690" style="s2">of conversations that I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.100" end="00:21:52.030" style="s2">kind of centered around a few different</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.690" end="00:21:54.760" style="s2">reactions some of them were</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.030" end="00:21:56.580" style="s2">predominantly cognitive you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.760" end="00:21:58.150" style="s2">the science what is the rational</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.580" end="00:22:00.790" style="s2">calculation that we need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.150" end="00:22:04.450" style="s2">here which is you know acting</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.790" end="00:22:07.240" style="s2">from ed than some of them some people</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.450" end="00:22:10.390" style="s2">went straight to having sense of care</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.240" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">for those who were in in jeopardy for</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">whatever reason from all the myriad of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.650" end="00:22:23.170" style="s2">outcomes that have been reverberating</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.330" end="00:22:25.900" style="s2">across culture right now and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.170" end="00:22:28.300" style="s2">other one which may be the most human</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.900" end="00:22:29.860" style="s2">one and and the big thing here too is of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.300" end="00:22:34.780" style="s2">course we all act from all of these in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.860" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">their own way but is the fearful one and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.780" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">this would be that gut area I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:43.570" style="s2">really good to kind of learn to get in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">contact with that you know this is I</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.570" end="00:22:48.460" style="s2">mean it really it&#39;s our mortality right</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:52.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s being reminded that things are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.460" end="00:22:54.820" style="s2">not quite as safe as they were but well</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.420" end="00:22:57.640" style="s2">that is valuable because it draws a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.820" end="00:23:00.550" style="s2">of attention due to our experience I</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.640" end="00:23:03.430" style="s2">feel like when we act we should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.550" end="00:23:07.690" style="s2">acting from a place of compassion and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.430" end="00:23:10.510" style="s2">then using our mind to reflect on how</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.690" end="00:23:17.380" style="s2">things are how it&#39;s working and if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.510" end="00:23:18.970" style="s2">keep all of these together it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.380" end="00:23:21.130" style="s2">if we can have a frame that includes all</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.970" end="00:23:24.330" style="s2">of them there&#39;s a more holistic way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.130" end="00:23:26.260" style="s2">acting in our own experience and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.330" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">interesting thing too as we say so</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.260" end="00:23:29.800" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of a negative side I said</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:32.470" style="s2">that originally the mind was there for</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.800" end="00:23:34.030" style="s2">thinking but the mind is also there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.470" end="00:23:37.390" style="s2">what&#39;s causing a lot of distress from</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.030" end="00:23:41.380" style="s2">the mind is the confusion the openness</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.390" end="00:23:43.420" style="s2">of the situation right and that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.380" end="00:23:45.370" style="s2">to be there and guess what you know we</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.420" end="00:23:46.930" style="s2">just discovered there&#39;s a bunch of space</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.370" end="00:23:49.960" style="s2">in our experience that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.930" end="00:23:53.380" style="s2">have any clarity on and that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.960" end="00:23:56.610" style="s2">the case but if we can keep it in - if</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.380" end="00:23:56.610" style="s2">we can bring it into the picture</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.030" end="00:24:03.580" style="s2">Minh eise&#39;s with with other areas of our</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.640" end="00:24:06.390" style="s2">experience so yeah just a few thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.580" end="00:24:08.830" style="s2">to kind of say where that came from and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.390" end="00:24:17.920" style="s2">maybe a thread that we could pull on</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.830" end="00:24:22.690" style="s2">somewhere there I&#39;ve been reflecting in</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.920" end="00:24:25.660" style="s2">the last couple days upon like coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.690" end="00:24:29.530" style="s2">back to you know accepting what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.660" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">perceived reality to be as it is not not</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.530" end="00:24:34.050" style="s2">resisting reality I think couple days</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">ago like I was trying to sleep and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.050" end="00:24:41.320" style="s2">having some anxiety and having trouble</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:43.750" style="s2">sleeping and then the next day I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.320" end="00:24:45.040" style="s2">was you know it&#39;s clicked on just</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.750" end="00:24:47.320" style="s2">clicked with me many times before but</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.040" end="00:24:51.070" style="s2">you know has to happen over and over</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.320" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">again like look this notion of safety</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:25:00.040" style="s2">this notion of comfort you know this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">notion of being disconnected from life</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.040" end="00:25:07.780" style="s2">you know and even kind of a we talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:10.150" style="s2">about the meaning crisis you know things</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.780" end="00:25:11.890" style="s2">are pretty damn meaningful now right we</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.150" end="00:25:13.240" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think people are worried</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.890" end="00:25:18.250" style="s2">about the meaning crisis at this point</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.240" end="00:25:20.590" style="s2">right and that&#39;s because our own you</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.250" end="00:25:24.610" style="s2">know our own safety you know our own</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.590" end="00:25:27.070" style="s2">creature comforts are on the line and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.610" end="00:25:29.920" style="s2">that kind of bring grounds us pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.070" end="00:25:34.780" style="s2">quickly and you know this notion of not</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.920" end="00:25:36.310" style="s2">resisting reality but like okay nothing</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.780" end="00:25:40.210" style="s2">is certain here you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.310" end="00:25:43.660" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen I can you know won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.210" end="00:25:45.400" style="s2">moments I can make the best decisions</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.660" end="00:25:50.380" style="s2">that I can I can try and be in touch</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.400" end="00:25:55.180" style="s2">with you know my body and what my body</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.380" end="00:25:57.010" style="s2">is telling me is Jared mentioned but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.180" end="00:26:01.660" style="s2">know I&#39;m not taking anything for granted</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.010" end="00:26:03.790" style="s2">right and I think as tragic as this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.660" end="00:26:06.550" style="s2">and it is tragic a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.790" end="00:26:07.750" style="s2">going to die I mean that&#39;s and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.550" end="00:26:13.810" style="s2">no getting around that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.750" end="00:26:17.650" style="s2">are dying at the same time you know this</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.810" end="00:26:21.250" style="s2">kind of tragedy seems to be the only way</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.650" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">that we can grow as humanity to to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.250" end="00:26:25.690" style="s2">evolve to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:27.309" style="s2">in a direction that we need to move if</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:39.129" style="s2">we&#39;re going to survive as a collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.309" end="00:26:48.549" style="s2">organism yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.129" end="00:26:51.789" style="s2">seems to be the case and I heard John</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.549" end="00:26:54.009" style="s2">Devaki and Jordan wool have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.789" end="00:26:56.139" style="s2">just the other day on John&#39;s channel and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.009" end="00:26:58.419" style="s2">one of the questions they raised is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.139" end="00:27:01.869" style="s2">something I think we&#39;ve all thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.419" end="00:27:05.529" style="s2">about a lot I know I have relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.869" end="00:27:10.299" style="s2">nature of addiction and perhaps in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.529" end="00:27:11.830" style="s2">particular to the scenario and whether a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.299" end="00:27:15.580" style="s2">friend or a family member or just</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.830" end="00:27:20.039" style="s2">someone you know they are in the throes</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.580" end="00:27:23.519" style="s2">of that the reciprocal closing of their</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.039" end="00:27:27.490" style="s2">salience landscape as John might say or</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.519" end="00:27:32.549" style="s2">that the meaning they&#39;re grasping out</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.490" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">for is a short-term fix or protection to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.549" end="00:27:38.669" style="s2">paper over a deeper hole lack of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.919" end="00:27:42.789" style="s2">connection in their lives that word</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.669" end="00:27:45.100" style="s2">connection with others lack of belief</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.789" end="00:27:49.570" style="s2">perhaps in the possibility that things</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.100" end="00:27:52.629" style="s2">could change so we have this narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.570" end="00:27:56.049" style="s2">and narrowing of scope until all of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.629" end="00:27:58.450" style="s2">sudden reality snaps back and whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.049" end="00:28:02.259" style="s2">the body gives way or a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.450" end="00:28:06.519" style="s2">breaks down there is some absolute rock</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.259" end="00:28:07.990" style="s2">bottom of gambling say seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.519" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">case than in many of the people I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.990" end="00:28:10.840" style="s2">spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:14.679" style="s2">there is that rock bottom moment that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.840" end="00:28:18.999" style="s2">calms and from there the trajectory is</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.679" end="00:28:22.990" style="s2">reset and the change occurs the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.999" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">is how deep does that rock bottom have</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.990" end="00:28:31.169" style="s2">to be in the case of our collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:36.029" style="s2">situation how is this tragedy enough and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.169" end="00:28:42.139" style="s2">what a fine point to turn on whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.029" end="00:28:44.940" style="s2">a tragedy or collapses so great that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.139" end="00:28:50.789" style="s2">continuity or the hope for continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.940" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">civilization that we might desire either</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.789" end="00:29:01.109" style="s2">persists or not is so tenuous and if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:03.450" style="s2">perhaps don&#39;t go low enough just</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.109" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">Scrabble back things together in roughly</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.450" end="00:29:10.679" style="s2">the same order and continue just as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:12.950" style="s2">were before without learning lessons and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.679" end="00:29:21.929" style="s2">I think that is a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.950" end="00:29:25.320" style="s2">dynamic how how how how necessary is is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.929" end="00:29:31.710" style="s2">that place of rock bottom and can we</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.320" end="00:29:33.989" style="s2">have any agency in extending an</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.710" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">invitation perhaps to an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.989" end="00:29:41.399" style="s2">something we like so much an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:45.119" style="s2">into that kind of experience so that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.399" end="00:29:47.639" style="s2">don&#39;t have to risk but it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.119" end="00:29:53.429" style="s2">something that came up for me Jason it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.639" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">ER it&#39;s a seems to me to be a a tight</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.429" end="00:30:21.860" style="s2">thing a very fine margins yeah I can</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:24.500" style="s2">that initiation thread it&#39;s like um an</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.860" end="00:30:27.860" style="s2">initiation is something that is entered</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.500" end="00:30:31.880" style="s2">into with intention and something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.860" end="00:30:34.400" style="s2">witnessed by a community and you begin</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.880" end="00:30:41.090" style="s2">in one place and end in a completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.400" end="00:30:42.710" style="s2">different place and like you said like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.090" end="00:30:46.100" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.710" end="00:30:47.230" style="s2">anymore there&#39;s work we have meaning up</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.100" end="00:30:50.030" style="s2">to our eyes right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.230" end="00:30:54.740" style="s2">so that that&#39;s the to me that&#39;s content</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.030" end="00:30:58.900" style="s2">or something to use as an ingredient in</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.740" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">this some sort of initiative process and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.900" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">I&#39;m curious if like like what what sorts</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:18.170" style="s2">of initiations are are happening right</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:20.860" style="s2">now and is there potential to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.170" end="00:31:23.810" style="s2">open source a process of designing one</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.860" end="00:31:25.910" style="s2">and entering into it with complete</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.810" end="00:31:27.740" style="s2">humility like like I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.910" end="00:31:32.110" style="s2">this will look like but just curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.740" end="00:31:35.140" style="s2">about maybe there&#39;s an assumption that</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:38.270" style="s2">an initiation could be a valuable thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.140" end="00:31:40.790" style="s2">hmm and maybe maybe move with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.270" end="00:31:43.430" style="s2">intention I&#39;m curious if you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.790" end="00:31:48.350" style="s2">any thoughts on that yeah like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.430" end="00:31:51.020" style="s2">coming to mind I was on another call as</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.350" end="00:31:53.390" style="s2">a repla wisdom call and we were just</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.020" end="00:31:56.420" style="s2">sort of talking about the situation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.390" end="00:31:59.420" style="s2">someone said that it feels like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.420" end="00:32:00.740" style="s2">about like get married like it feels</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.420" end="00:32:02.900" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a marriage just going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.740" end="00:32:05.330" style="s2">happen it&#39;s kind of anxiety associated</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.900" end="00:32:07.910" style="s2">with that situation and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.330" end="00:32:09.380" style="s2">else said after that is I think divorce</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.910" end="00:32:12.200" style="s2">is a better metaphor if it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.380" end="00:32:14.060" style="s2">divorce is happening and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.200" end="00:32:17.300" style="s2">throughout like you know a birth thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.060" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">pains and whatnot and then the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.300" end="00:32:23.390" style="s2">initiation piece comes to mind as well</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">and I when you&#39;re talking with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.390" end="00:32:27.590" style="s2">column what came to mind was what is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:29.750" style="s2">best net</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.590" end="00:32:33.620" style="s2">for to use in this situation was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.750" end="00:32:36.830" style="s2">wisest metaphor and maybe not being so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.620" end="00:32:38.120" style="s2">concerned about the descriptive aspect</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.830" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">like are we getting the metaphor right</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.120" end="00:32:43.730" style="s2">is it accurate but more of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:45.529" style="s2">normative aspect was like the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.730" end="00:32:49.429" style="s2">ethical metaphor we can use that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.529" end="00:32:52.429" style="s2">to inspire us and and maintain this</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.429" end="00:33:06.070" style="s2">feeling of meaningfulness but inject it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.429" end="00:33:09.529" style="s2">with wisdom really kita I put I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.070" end="00:33:14.590" style="s2">just a few things on the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.529" end="00:33:17.690" style="s2">and of course we can have a crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.590" end="00:33:21.409" style="s2">not enough meaning and then we can also</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.690" end="00:33:23.630" style="s2">have a crisis of too much without and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.409" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">wisdom might be the right word to use</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.630" end="00:33:30.429" style="s2">without a way to to be in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">with that to transform with that to</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.429" end="00:33:37.159" style="s2">bring it in and out you know to expand</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:43.070" style="s2">and contract it and to do so in a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.159" end="00:33:45.440" style="s2">that&#39;s in what could we use was a right</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.070" end="00:33:49.669" style="s2">relationship with community with ecology</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.440" end="00:33:52.789" style="s2">I think we&#39;re going to see the effect</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.669" end="00:33:54.740" style="s2">that is meaningful it&#39;s like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.789" end="00:33:57.919" style="s2">to do something about that sale our</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.740" end="00:34:02.240" style="s2">bodies our hearts all of it is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.919" end="00:34:05.539" style="s2">activated and and where does that energy</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.240" end="00:34:11.419" style="s2">go you know we could see very much we</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.539" end="00:34:14.810" style="s2">can see the various responses to the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.419" end="00:34:18.580" style="s2">death of God in the form of holding</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.810" end="00:34:21.409" style="s2">tight to ideology that might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.580" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">fragmented distortion of the whole that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.409" end="00:34:28.730" style="s2">is in some sense ER almost necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">disconnected from a we that we can all</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.730" end="00:34:33.349" style="s2">participate in and sort of creates an</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:38.980" style="s2">us-and-them in order to sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.349" end="00:34:38.980" style="s2">sense is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.250" end="00:34:51.379" style="s2">it&#39;s closed I think to the the essence</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.929" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">of transforming meaning itself on an</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.379" end="00:34:57.589" style="s2">ongoing basis in a way perhaps more in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:35:04.670" style="s2">touch with the drastic changes of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.589" end="00:35:08.690" style="s2">time and so adding that in then to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.670" end="00:35:11.180" style="s2">initiation piece with what does wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.690" end="00:35:14.420" style="s2">therefore look like and perhaps we could</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.180" end="00:35:17.630" style="s2">presence just again what we began by</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.420" end="00:35:22.520" style="s2">talking about some degree which is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.630" end="00:35:27.980" style="s2">relationship between speeding from being</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.520" end="00:35:32.329" style="s2">from perhaps discerning from at least</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.980" end="00:35:34.940" style="s2">important in this heart or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.329" end="00:35:40.339" style="s2">aligned centeredness aura grounded</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.940" end="00:35:44.839" style="s2">missing something and transmitting that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.339" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">with each other mode of communication so</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.839" end="00:35:57.289" style="s2">what does so calling repeated to to pick</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:36:02.510" style="s2">up them what does what does what does a</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.289" end="00:36:14.630" style="s2">wise initiation process look like can we</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.510" end="00:36:16.819" style="s2">say anything about that I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.630" end="00:36:19.910" style="s2">trouble getting around the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.819" end="00:36:22.730" style="s2">distinction between you know each of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.910" end="00:36:25.730" style="s2">situations in our and you know in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.730" end="00:36:29.710" style="s2">real life in IRL of course this is also</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.730" end="00:36:31.250" style="s2">real life but you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.710" end="00:36:32.720" style="s2">you know when we have these</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.250" end="00:36:36.200" style="s2">conversations about what wouldn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.720" end="00:36:40.220" style="s2">initiation look like it&#39;s very strange</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.200" end="00:36:46.430" style="s2">to to consider it in this kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.220" end="00:36:49.579" style="s2">know digital space right because at</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.430" end="00:36:51.080" style="s2">least in my mind in my background you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.579" end="00:36:54.950" style="s2">know I I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.080" end="00:36:56.690" style="s2">in kind of a very you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.950" end="00:36:59.860" style="s2">traditions I grew up in was very much</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.690" end="00:37:03.050" style="s2">around this kind of traditional set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.860" end="00:37:05.420" style="s2">structures and initiations that but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.050" end="00:37:09.290" style="s2">was like you know I was there like I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.420" end="00:37:12.530" style="s2">like touching the ground right and I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.290" end="00:37:14.390" style="s2">with people and interact with them at</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.530" end="00:37:17.150" style="s2">their worst moments and that there you</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.390" end="00:37:19.570" style="s2">know and at their better moments and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.150" end="00:37:27.050" style="s2">going through this process this very</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.570" end="00:37:30.740" style="s2">physical process you know so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.050" end="00:37:32.660" style="s2">hard for me to I don&#39;t know like I just</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.740" end="00:37:34.610" style="s2">I&#39;m having trouble understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.660" end="00:37:39.260" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about I guess is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.610" end="00:37:41.690" style="s2">saying you know separate from my mind it</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.260" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">immediately goes to where I&#39;m living and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.690" end="00:37:47.750" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay you know who I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.930" end="00:37:49.730" style="s2">new in my area but starting to develop a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.750" end="00:37:54.530" style="s2">community you know starting to develop</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.730" end="00:37:57.020" style="s2">ideas for you know how I want to help</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.530" end="00:37:59.960" style="s2">this community evolve to co-evolve with</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.020" end="00:38:02.900" style="s2">his community and with the land I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.960" end="00:38:06.590" style="s2">and the the ecology and the history and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.900" end="00:38:09.560" style="s2">the background and to me that like when</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.590" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">I bring up an initiation process and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.560" end="00:38:14.230" style="s2">when I think of it in those terms I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:16.280" style="s2">like yes okay I can start working</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.230" end="00:38:19.700" style="s2">thinking in those terms but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.280" end="00:38:23.240" style="s2">thinking about digital space I just</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:31.060" style="s2">don&#39;t you know it&#39;s too abstract for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.240" end="00:38:34.760" style="s2">I really like that there was a moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.060" end="00:38:36.290" style="s2">and previously I just had the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.760" end="00:38:37.820" style="s2">talk about my immediate experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.290" end="00:38:39.950" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.820" end="00:38:45.350" style="s2">feeling occupying like maybe 80% of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.950" end="00:38:48.410" style="s2">thought about you know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.350" end="00:38:51.320" style="s2">with my my wife of my family do we go up</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.410" end="00:38:52.970" style="s2">up north do we bunker down here just</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.320" end="00:38:55.670" style="s2">like the practicalities of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.970" end="00:38:59.570" style="s2">and sort of a localism type reach out to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.670" end="00:39:01.880" style="s2">my neighbors and so there&#39;s a desire to</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.570" end="00:39:04.330" style="s2">kind of talk about that figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.880" end="00:39:06.280" style="s2">you guys are doing and then I</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.330" end="00:39:07.780" style="s2">I think this is what you&#39;re gesturing at</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.280" end="00:39:10.840" style="s2">Jason and I feel it does that just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.780" end="00:39:13.870" style="s2">risk of entering into a masturbatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.840" end="00:39:16.150" style="s2">space with ideas and like I&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.870" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">first to acknowledge like I totally you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.150" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">know masturbated with ideas my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:26.470" style="s2">lately that&#39;s the podcasting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:30.430" style="s2">and it&#39;s fun it&#39;s creative you just like</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.470" end="00:39:32.050" style="s2">have ideas sex ideation and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.430" end="00:39:33.670" style="s2">there&#39;s like some something there that</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.050" end="00:39:35.320" style="s2">could be utilized for the situation that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.670" end="00:39:37.570" style="s2">creativity that being comfortable in</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.320" end="00:39:41.320" style="s2">liminal spaces that could be of use and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.570" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">of service right now but I just saw a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.320" end="00:39:44.440" style="s2">lot more grounded when you said what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:47.140" style="s2">said Jason and I didn&#39;t kind of want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.440" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">see if we can kind of merge both of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.140" end="00:39:58.300" style="s2">those tendencies yeah I mean this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">I mean this is very practical but I I</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.300" end="00:40:06.010" style="s2">think we need to start converting these</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:08.350" style="s2">networks we have online and I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.010" end="00:40:10.690" style="s2">we&#39;re all you know pretty pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.350" end="00:40:13.390" style="s2">networked and you know there&#39;s it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.690" end="00:40:14.530" style="s2">of becoming a broad space but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.390" end="00:40:18.580" style="s2">start converting them into real life</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.530" end="00:40:21.490" style="s2">communities right it&#39;s you know when I</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.460" end="00:41:08.280" style="s2">the seed of a real community here that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.440" end="00:41:11.890" style="s2">is kind of connecting the digital</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.280" end="00:41:14.950" style="s2">ideation space with you know real life</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.990" end="00:41:48.620" style="s2">think we need to start moving in that</p>

<p begin="00:41:53.540" end="00:41:56.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the direction we need to move in</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.070" end="00:41:59.720" style="s2">like we need to start finding each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.890" end="00:42:03.310" style="s2">and getting closer to each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.720" end="00:42:06.020" style="s2">whatever that means right and actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.310" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">serving each other in our physical space</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.020" end="00:42:12.790" style="s2">as well as our ideational space yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:14.870" style="s2">yes I couldn&#39;t agree more</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.790" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">Jason this is why I&#39;ve been so amped</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.870" end="00:42:21.980" style="s2">about your your farming stuff yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:24.650" style="s2">the farming posts like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.980" end="00:42:26.360" style="s2">the like a picture of a plant coming out</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.650" end="00:42:28.340" style="s2">of the ground this it&#39;s like the clothes</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.360" end="00:42:29.810" style="s2">you closest you can get to like touching</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.340" end="00:42:33.080" style="s2">the ground through a computer screen</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.810" end="00:42:37.820" style="s2">right okay yeah so yeah I mean the whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.080" end="00:42:39.410" style="s2">initiatory piece it doesn&#39;t work without</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.820" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">embodiment I mean I totally agree with</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.410" end="00:42:46.370" style="s2">you Jason and and for me it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:50.420" style="s2">like like how do you harness the power</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.370" end="00:42:53.230" style="s2">of digital communication platform it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.420" end="00:42:54.770" style="s2">like well maybe maybe it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.230" end="00:42:58.910" style="s2">connecting with your immediate</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.770" end="00:43:00.470" style="s2">experience like like Peters open</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.910" end="00:43:02.750" style="s2">sourcing your process what are you going</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.470" end="00:43:06.950" style="s2">through and you make yourself available</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.750" end="00:43:08.840" style="s2">to other people who may have you may</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.950" end="00:43:12.950" style="s2">have a need and you have a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.840" end="00:43:17.060" style="s2">just like making making the context that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.950" end="00:43:22.460" style="s2">you are most able to serve in available</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.060" end="00:43:25.010" style="s2">and putting that out there yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.460" end="00:43:27.380" style="s2">I guess I would you know just add and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.010" end="00:43:28.590" style="s2">also copy out what I what I said is I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.380" end="00:43:31.170" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.590" end="00:43:33.900" style="s2">you know the wonderful thing about today</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.170" end="00:43:35.970" style="s2">is that you know we&#39;re not when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.900" end="00:43:39.060" style="s2">about things like localism or building</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.970" end="00:43:41.190" style="s2">kind of like a commons based kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.060" end="00:43:42.330" style="s2">communities or facto localism or you</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.190" end="00:43:43.770" style="s2">know something like that is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.330" end="00:43:45.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to the past for bringing</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.770" end="00:43:48.600" style="s2">the past the wisdom of the past into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.240" end="00:43:51.270" style="s2">future right but we&#39;re what we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.600" end="00:43:53.780" style="s2">bringing with it is this digital</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.270" end="00:43:56.490" style="s2">technology for one you know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.780" end="00:44:00.890" style="s2">technology more broadly which I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.490" end="00:44:04.170" style="s2">you know we must utilize you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.890" end="00:44:08.430" style="s2">you know peer-to-peer technology for</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.170" end="00:44:12.690" style="s2">example is a great example of how or</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.430" end="00:44:14.100" style="s2">just if you have wisdom to share or what</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.690" end="00:44:17.460" style="s2">you&#39;re doing calling I know you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.100" end="00:44:19.830" style="s2">this idea of like stripping for as like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.460" end="00:44:21.240" style="s2">you know it workstation you know for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.830" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">you know kernel and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.240" end="00:44:27.000" style="s2">really fun cool idea right I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:28.830" style="s2">a great example of combining this kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.000" end="00:44:31.590" style="s2">of what you know kind of this embodied</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.830" end="00:44:34.350" style="s2">thing but also connecting it to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.590" end="00:44:39.000" style="s2">water network and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.350" end="00:44:41.130" style="s2">cool and so yeah I think that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.000" end="00:44:42.900" style="s2">really the key task right now is we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.130" end="00:44:45.540" style="s2">been in this ideational space and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.900" end="00:44:50.330" style="s2">realizing the need for resiliency right</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.540" end="00:44:53.370" style="s2">and and that means in real life and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.330" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">bridging these two worlds and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.370" end="00:44:58.680" style="s2">so they&#39;re they&#39;re kind of giving each</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:45:02.100" style="s2">other feedback coat you know feedback</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.680" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">over bus&#39;ness right I think is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.100" end="00:45:10.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the challenge that I that I see</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:15.330" style="s2">and the opportunity yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.230" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">this this thread that are a few threads</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.330" end="00:45:21.600" style="s2">that I feel like are weaving together</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:27.210" style="s2">now so we started with a question in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.600" end="00:45:33.600" style="s2">about wisdom and I think wisdom what</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.210" end="00:45:35.570" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to associated with is not so</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.600" end="00:45:41.470" style="s2">much about what the right thing to do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.570" end="00:45:45.160" style="s2">but to bring an openness to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.470" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">the table you know kind of the the are</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.160" end="00:45:51.100" style="s2">kinda classic archetype of the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:51.670" style="s2">who knows he knows nothing right I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.100" end="00:45:54.520" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.670" end="00:45:59.080" style="s2">the reason it&#39;s valuable is because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.520" end="00:46:02.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t direct boundaries for us it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.080" end="00:46:07.510" style="s2">actually keeps all the territory open</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.380" end="00:46:09.960" style="s2">for exploration and so I see this this</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.510" end="00:46:13.480" style="s2">wisdom component being essential</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.960" end="00:46:16.750" style="s2">especially in this kind of meta tribal</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.480" end="00:46:20.020" style="s2">space you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not the it has</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.750" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">some similarities to our tribal past but</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.020" end="00:46:25.720" style="s2">we&#39;re a connected global civilization</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:28.030" style="s2">there has to be an openness for people</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.720" end="00:46:30.010" style="s2">to collaborate and not be locked in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.030" end="00:46:32.200" style="s2">their own ideological bubbles and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.010" end="00:46:34.150" style="s2">learn from each other the moment we go</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.200" end="00:46:35.380" style="s2">down to locking everything down into</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.150" end="00:46:38.380" style="s2">private groups that don&#39;t communicate</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.380" end="00:46:44.320" style="s2">and don&#39;t exchange we&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.380" end="00:46:46.450" style="s2">disconnected group of groups and so so</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.320" end="00:46:50.260" style="s2">much of that wisdom component I feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.450" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">like is a lot of what what what this</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.260" end="00:46:55.630" style="s2">online work does exploring different</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:59.230" style="s2">perspectives playing with boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.630" end="00:47:00.970" style="s2">borders finding connections relations I</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.230" end="00:47:04.240" style="s2">know Jason and I used the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.970" end="00:47:07.240" style="s2">pneumatic mediation law yeah I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.240" end="00:47:09.700" style="s2">this is kind of nourishing a or the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.240" end="00:47:13.930" style="s2">intention from a strong intention I feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.700" end="00:47:21.070" style="s2">is to nourish this openness of mind so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.930" end="00:47:23.170" style="s2">that then when we act our body doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.070" end="00:47:26.110" style="s2">have limitations</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.170" end="00:47:29.020" style="s2">it can MIDI in our environment can go</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.110" end="00:47:31.960" style="s2">where it is needed to be and to act from</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.020" end="00:47:35.410" style="s2">care and compassion and not be</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.960" end="00:47:39.970" style="s2">obstructed but aided by our open minds</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.410" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">as opposed to closed ones yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.970" end="00:47:44.320" style="s2">couldn&#39;t say something about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:47.470" style="s2">like I I&#39;ve been noticing the how much</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.320" end="00:47:49.360" style="s2">in survival mode I&#39;ve been like my</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.470" end="00:47:52.690" style="s2">roommates and I like we just started a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.360" end="00:47:55.270" style="s2">pretty robust quarantine procedure for</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.690" end="00:47:58.660" style="s2">for the four of us that live here</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.270" end="00:48:01.600" style="s2">and and just how much of my attention</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.660" end="00:48:03.850" style="s2">has been occupied by making sure all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.600" end="00:48:07.750" style="s2">supplies are in order I can get just</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.850" end="00:48:13.030" style="s2">like getting the getting the nest ready</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.750" end="00:48:15.730" style="s2">to roost and not a lot of my attention</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.030" end="00:48:19.710" style="s2">has been on how can it be most</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.730" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">compassionate it&#39;s been on like how do I</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.710" end="00:48:32.230" style="s2">set myself up for a longer term success</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:34.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t burn out um and I it feels very</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.230" end="00:48:35.500" style="s2">different and it feels very different in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.300" end="00:48:40.869" style="s2">the body acting probably place of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.500" end="00:48:43.000" style="s2">compassion versus pure gut survival it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.869" end="00:48:45.640" style="s2">quite a stark contrast actually between</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.000" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">spaces when I have been acting from a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.640" end="00:48:49.420" style="s2">really open heart</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:52.030" style="s2">yeah well and the gut is the core thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.420" end="00:48:55.170" style="s2">there right cuz yeah we can&#39;t ignore our</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.030" end="00:48:57.220" style="s2">survival instincts they should do</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.170" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">they&#39;re there for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.220" end="00:49:03.330" style="s2">they yeah I think the problem is is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:07.090" style="s2">when we&#39;ve become to contain or to</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.330" end="00:49:11.500" style="s2">constrictor around one of these areas so</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.090" end="00:49:13.750" style="s2">trying to constantly expand our space to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.500" end="00:49:17.140" style="s2">include each one of them the confusion</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.750" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">the fear and the compassion to all arise</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.140" end="00:49:22.869" style="s2">simultaneously yeah but to exclude any</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:25.330" style="s2">of them this is not good and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.869" end="00:49:27.010" style="s2">situation is going to be unique in what</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.330" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">type of preparing they need to do and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.010" end="00:49:31.780" style="s2">their body knows everybody everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:34.390" style="s2">such a different context and perspective</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.780" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">so it&#39;s gonna be marion of ways but if</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.390" end="00:49:37.930" style="s2">we&#39;re only focused on the survival mode</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.100" end="00:49:40.000" style="s2">that&#39;s when we get this can&#39;t panic</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.930" end="00:49:43.770" style="s2">behavior where you know it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.000" end="00:49:45.580" style="s2">an anxiety it&#39;s a hyperventilation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.770" end="00:49:47.560" style="s2">when we get those cultural</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.580" end="00:49:51.010" style="s2">hyperventilation &#39;z they shut down</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.560" end="00:49:54.850" style="s2">systems you know so it&#39;s good to not be</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.010" end="00:49:57.910" style="s2">completely consumed by them and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.850" end="00:50:01.000" style="s2">came to mind there is return to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.910" end="00:50:04.720" style="s2">thought of wisdom it seems like what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.000" end="00:50:07.030" style="s2">described what you&#39;re doing Colin and to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.720" end="00:50:08.840" style="s2">use your model Jared I think that got in</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.030" end="00:50:11.900" style="s2">the heart it seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.840" end="00:50:14.450" style="s2">to like you know put the oxygen mask on</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.900" end="00:50:17.960" style="s2">first you know kind of like get some</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.450" end="00:50:20.420" style="s2">level of survival instincts online and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.960" end="00:50:23.690" style="s2">look after you you know yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.420" end="00:50:27.170" style="s2">your loved ones before turning the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.690" end="00:50:31.700" style="s2">attention on to you know like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.170" end="00:50:34.010" style="s2">or like you know from the heart at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.700" end="00:50:36.620" style="s2">that&#39;s how I am processing it right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.010" end="00:50:37.940" style="s2">but like I feel like if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.620" end="00:50:39.350" style="s2">use that model again from the head to</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.940" end="00:50:40.990" style="s2">the gut to the heart it feels like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.350" end="00:50:43.010" style="s2">just fluttering and flickering</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.990" end="00:50:45.170" style="s2">sporadically between all of them and not</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.010" end="00:50:47.720" style="s2">being grounded and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.170" end="00:50:49.580" style="s2">operating with wisdom at the moment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.720" end="00:50:51.500" style="s2">Peter you said you&#39;d send a tweet the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.580" end="00:50:53.150" style="s2">other day where you said do you I forgot</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.500" end="00:50:55.100" style="s2">you weren&#39;t about it was like you lost</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.150" end="00:50:57.320" style="s2">your stoicism is that how you said it</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.100" end="00:51:01.700" style="s2">yes can you talk more about what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.320" end="00:51:03.790" style="s2">meant by that I got angry so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.700" end="00:51:05.840" style="s2">like peeing lots of different people</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.790" end="00:51:07.190" style="s2">like you know kind of like really</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.840" end="00:51:09.350" style="s2">intelligent people in our space having</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.190" end="00:51:11.510" style="s2">conversations with um people from like</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.350" end="00:51:13.850" style="s2">you know old co-workers from high school</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.510" end="00:51:15.020" style="s2">just to get a sense of everyone right of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.850" end="00:51:17.060" style="s2">what they&#39;re going through how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.020" end="00:51:19.460" style="s2">experiencing with this and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.060" end="00:51:22.340" style="s2">of uh I guess denial about the situation</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.460" end="00:51:23.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s just a flu this was maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.340" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">is changing now rapidly so maybe people</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.960" end="00:51:28.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t changing their opinions but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:31.340" style="s2">just the flu is gonna go by a way by May</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.420" end="00:51:34.310" style="s2">and then just and then there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.340" end="00:51:35.630" style="s2">like this almost a sense of like wanting</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.310" end="00:51:37.190" style="s2">to be right now and I&#39;m like this is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.630" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">the time to even want to be right about</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.190" end="00:51:42.680" style="s2">this and there&#39;s an irritation I guess</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:44.540" style="s2">from people&#39;s unwillingness to even kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.680" end="00:51:46.370" style="s2">of consider like bad - worst-case</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.540" end="00:51:50.420" style="s2">scenarios and then kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.370" end="00:51:52.580" style="s2">through them it&#39;s like I had this it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.420" end="00:51:53.660" style="s2">the incident yesterday that you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.580" end="00:51:55.870" style="s2">preparing I&#39;m leaning on the side of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.660" end="00:51:59.480" style="s2">being more prepared so you know having</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.870" end="00:52:02.420" style="s2">month supply cash on hand you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.480" end="00:52:03.890" style="s2">of a getaway out of the city and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.420" end="00:52:05.660" style="s2">why I tell this plans to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.890" end="00:52:08.360" style="s2">like just say I don&#39;t wanna use this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.660" end="00:52:10.310" style="s2">word but like someone who&#39;s maybe gone</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.360" end="00:52:11.570" style="s2">more on the normy side right like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.310" end="00:52:13.700" style="s2">somebody was not plugged into any of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.570" end="00:52:15.110" style="s2">these intellectual spaces I told that to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.700" end="00:52:16.820" style="s2">one of them and then she&#39;s called me a</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.110" end="00:52:19.160" style="s2">conspiracy theorist for being prepared</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.820" end="00:52:20.510" style="s2">as I am and then I was talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.160" end="00:52:22.040" style="s2">friend who&#39;s sort of plugged in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.510" end="00:52:22.500" style="s2">whole conspiracy theory realm with</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.040" end="00:52:24.450" style="s2">keyonnah</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.500" end="00:52:27.210" style="s2">stuff and he called me a Normie for</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.450" end="00:52:29.730" style="s2">being as prepared as I am it&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.210" end="00:52:31.230" style="s2">mind was like whoa and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.730" end="00:52:32.340" style="s2">both of those being called in or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.230" end="00:52:35.370" style="s2">call the conspiracy theorists just</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.340" end="00:52:37.080" style="s2">bothered me and then having kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.370" end="00:52:38.040" style="s2">tension with my parents who kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.080" end="00:52:40.410" style="s2">wanting to is this some of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.040" end="00:52:41.820" style="s2">narratives and so I just lost my</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.410" end="00:52:43.800" style="s2">stoicism which got angry and I ran with</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.820" end="00:52:45.510" style="s2">the anger without trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.800" end="00:52:47.970" style="s2">usually have a relationship in</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.510" end="00:52:51.570" style="s2">maintaining serenity with it so that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.970" end="00:52:52.770" style="s2">the spirit of that tweet mmm what is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.570" end="00:52:57.110" style="s2">running away with anger what did that</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.770" end="00:53:01.170" style="s2">look like just indulging in it uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.110" end="00:53:07.320" style="s2">yeah just say did you break anything no</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.170" end="00:53:10.320" style="s2">just my stoicism did you did you like</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.320" end="00:53:12.540" style="s2">yell at people I&#39;m just confused how</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.320" end="00:53:14.010" style="s2">anger like manifests yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.540" end="00:53:16.140" style="s2">question yeah got into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.010" end="00:53:25.290" style="s2">unnecessary kind of arguments that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.140" end="00:53:27.090" style="s2">feel that&#39;s just feels petty do you do</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.290" end="00:53:28.440" style="s2">have a judgement around that like do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.090" end="00:53:34.560" style="s2">think it&#39;s do you think it&#39;s bad that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.440" end="00:53:36.750" style="s2">you lost your stoicism no oddly enough</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.560" end="00:53:37.950" style="s2">like it&#39;s just more fact that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.750" end="00:53:42.060" style="s2">accept what it is so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.950" end="00:53:43.740" style="s2">happened but I think I want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.060" end="00:53:46.290" style="s2">more in a state where you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.740" end="00:53:47.400" style="s2">kind of indulge into anger because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.290" end="00:53:51.690" style="s2">don&#39;t think that was healthy in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.400" end="00:53:54.630" style="s2">context mm-hmm well I will just say from</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.690" end="00:53:56.490" style="s2">my perspective you&#39;re reaching out and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.630" end="00:53:58.530" style="s2">getting different perspectives from such</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.490" end="00:54:00.930" style="s2">a broad swath of people like that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.530" end="00:54:03.990" style="s2">that sounds very wise to me right it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.930" end="00:54:07.290" style="s2">opening things up taking stock broadly</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.990" end="00:54:09.510" style="s2">and your anger might have been because</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.290" end="00:54:11.730" style="s2">bringing wisdom to that and others being</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.510" end="00:54:13.650" style="s2">quick to jump to conclusions about other</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.730" end="00:54:16.080" style="s2">perspectives or the totality of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.650" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">what&#39;s happening I mean that that&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.080" end="00:54:23.130" style="s2">more constricted you know closed mind I</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">suppose but yeah so it seems natural I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.130" end="00:54:28.470" style="s2">had a similar similar thing with some</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:30.730" style="s2">family members where there wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.470" end="00:54:33.790" style="s2">seriousness and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.730" end="00:54:34.870" style="s2">there&#39;s sternness that is quite rare</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.790" end="00:54:39.130" style="s2">from from me</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.870" end="00:54:41.770" style="s2">that came out but it it also might have</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.130" end="00:54:45.610" style="s2">been appears to be somewhat effective so</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.770" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s sometimes it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.610" end="00:54:48.520" style="s2">for a reason it&#39;s just like to your</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.520" end="00:54:56.350" style="s2">indulging in it I&#39;m not getting consumed</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.310" end="00:54:59.080" style="s2">by it completely like it&#39;s always a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.350" end="00:55:00.670" style="s2">fiery element it&#39;s quick and bursts up</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.080" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">and but if you know how it to burst up</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.670" end="00:55:05.190" style="s2">it kind of quickly dissipates as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.940" end="00:55:13.470" style="s2">like indulging in an emotion versus like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:13.470" style="s2">having the courage to actually feel it</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.040" end="00:55:19.330" style="s2">like what&#39;s the difference I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.100" end="00:55:22.450" style="s2">there&#39;s I think for me the difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.330" end="00:55:25.360" style="s2">ISM is there&#39;s a much meta awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.450" end="00:55:28.840" style="s2">it is there so you can notice the anger</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.360" end="00:55:31.060" style="s2">and you can harness it but there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.840" end="00:55:35.320" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.060" end="00:55:36.910" style="s2">completely take you over versus it just</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.320" end="00:55:40.000" style="s2">completely takes you over and you lose</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.910" end="00:55:45.850" style="s2">your self of course the self is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.000" end="00:55:54.460" style="s2">other time I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.850" end="00:56:05.770" style="s2">resonates with what&#39;s hanging on to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.460" end="00:56:08.230" style="s2">too long acting from anger and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.770" end="00:56:12.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a moment where you do come in to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.230" end="00:56:14.770" style="s2">mentor awareness and you can choose you</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.280" end="00:56:18.010" style="s2">know you can choose to drive the needle</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.770" end="00:56:22.180" style="s2">in a little bit further seems to me I</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.010" end="00:56:25.330" style="s2">remember distinctly I think yeah as a</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.890" end="00:58:14.519" style="s2">and so for many reasons anger or</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.359" end="00:58:18.029" style="s2">frustration or being directive about</p>

<p begin="00:58:18.029" end="00:58:22.410" style="s2">running some kind of program and making</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.009" end="00:58:24.539" style="s2">decisions and it&#39;s like no go this way</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.410" end="00:58:28.650" style="s2">or hold it this way something like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.539" end="00:58:30.599" style="s2">you feel it come out strained I think I</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:36.150" style="s2">must have said like sorry 20 times in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.599" end="00:58:38.670" style="s2">day in the live where you know my total</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.150" end="00:58:40.920" style="s2">was not as it couldn&#39;t be I&#39;ve had that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.670" end="00:58:42.630" style="s2">I had that strain but I just said sorry</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.920" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">immediately and it&#39;s just so funny</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.630" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">this is snappy we both had like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:53.670" style="s2">made a perspective on that and just</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:55.339" style="s2">looking at that pattern just play out</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.670" end="00:58:59.130" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.339" end="00:59:00.719" style="s2">it&#39;s something about you know and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.130" end="00:59:03.539" style="s2">processing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.719" end="00:59:08.929" style="s2">having that buffer zone as much as</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.539" end="00:59:12.209" style="s2">possible you know a lot of love and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.929" end="00:59:16.259" style="s2">think we&#39;re all experiencing it you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.209" end="00:59:17.939" style="s2">walking past houses and seeing someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.259" end="00:59:19.259" style="s2">go out the door and the tone they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.939" end="00:59:23.489" style="s2">taking with whoever they&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.259" end="00:59:25.439" style="s2">inside is not so balanced and walking</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.489" end="00:59:26.609" style="s2">past people on the street and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.439" end="00:59:29.039" style="s2">almost like a psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.609" end="00:59:31.619" style="s2">where you might get a festival of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.039" end="00:59:33.299" style="s2">something and it&#39;s at a certain stage of</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.619" end="00:59:35.160" style="s2">the trip and you&#39;re looking around and</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.299" end="00:59:36.809" style="s2">you&#39;re just seeing the emanation of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.160" end="00:59:38.699" style="s2">emotion on everyone&#39;s face it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.809" end="00:59:41.670" style="s2">they&#39;re almost wearing Greek masks of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.699" end="00:59:44.279" style="s2">despair at times much of that is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.670" end="00:59:46.949" style="s2">projection often people get sad too in</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.279" end="00:59:50.489" style="s2">it it can feel a little bit like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.949" end="00:59:54.749" style="s2">walking along and seeing faces just</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.489" end="00:59:58.049" style="s2">steeped in fear it has been like that at</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.749" end="01:00:01.459" style="s2">least around where I&#39;ve been and so with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.049" end="01:00:05.160" style="s2">all that with all that effect and</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.459" end="01:00:07.289" style="s2">uncertainty it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.160" end="01:00:10.229" style="s2">understandable we go through phases of</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.289" end="01:00:12.989" style="s2">emotions so it seems to me having the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.229" end="01:00:15.630" style="s2">mental perspective the process through</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.989" end="01:00:19.289" style="s2">it and and then it seems to be choice</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.630" end="01:00:25.170" style="s2">there seems to be choice in in whether</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.289" end="01:00:29.209" style="s2">you choose to once you once you can get</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.170" end="01:00:32.039" style="s2">get that awareness is your turn then to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.209" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">project outward the cause of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.039" end="01:00:36.209" style="s2">to what degree can you take</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:39.479" style="s2">responsibility for it while also having</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.209" end="01:00:43.099" style="s2">compassion for their conditions and</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.479" end="01:00:46.289" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s that it&#39;s not a clear</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.099" end="01:00:49.999" style="s2">dance but it&#39;s something to be discerned</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.289" end="01:00:49.999" style="s2">in individual cases</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.019" end="01:01:08.509" style="s2">mm what&#39;s coming up there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:10.700" style="s2">attention I feel with I&#39;m finding this</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.509" end="01:01:15.349" style="s2">conversation very therapeutic right now</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.700" end="01:01:17.089" style="s2">I&#39;m just enjoying being here and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.349" end="01:01:19.460" style="s2">know talking with you all and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.089" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">there&#39;s like there&#39;s a tension between</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.460" end="01:01:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just the the therapeutic aspect but</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:26.630" style="s2">then a desire to get really tactical</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.559" end="01:01:29.599" style="s2">other things just talk about tactical</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.630" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">things are we wasting our time like you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.599" end="01:01:34.609" style="s2">know let&#39;s what do we do and then that</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.319" style="s2">would the wisdom right it&#39;s like what is</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.609" end="01:01:37.549" style="s2">the right what is the right the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.319" end="01:01:39.140" style="s2">because they&#39;re both kind of good like</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.549" end="01:01:41.089" style="s2">having a therapeutic conversation and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.140" end="01:01:43.400" style="s2">then having that kind of a tactical</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.089" end="01:01:46.910" style="s2">mindset so that&#39;s the attention I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.400" end="01:01:50.539" style="s2">feeling right now and then the adjacent</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.910" end="01:01:53.420" style="s2">adjacent thought to that was something</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.539" end="01:01:55.400" style="s2">Collins I think tweeted was just</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.420" end="01:01:58.430" style="s2">something about like I always wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.400" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">be Keegan five and now that I am like I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.430" end="01:02:00.890" style="s2">don&#39;t really care it&#39;s later so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:02.750" style="s2">something like that like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.890" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">Keegan five ish or something no I didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.789" style="s2">level or that&#39;s the sense I get from</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.059" end="01:02:22.339" style="s2">from us and there&#39;s a part of me that</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.789" end="01:02:23.779" style="s2">like wishes you know like you guys were</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.779" end="01:02:27.079" style="s2">my neighbors right because these</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.160" end="01:02:29.089" style="s2">conversations are very therapeutic and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.079" end="01:02:32.809" style="s2">can&#39;t have this with a lot of people on</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.089" end="01:02:33.920" style="s2">the ground level here and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.809" end="01:02:36.230" style="s2">another thought so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.920" end="01:02:38.509" style="s2">understanding gratitude but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.230" end="01:02:45.019" style="s2">something here that can be leveraged I</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.509" end="01:02:50.630" style="s2">think with this this tension I agree to</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.019" end="01:02:53.470" style="s2">me that feeds back to this well it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.630" end="01:03:01.160" style="s2">touch with these themes about wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.470" end="01:03:01.609" style="s2">this it&#39;s like that&#39;s it that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.609" end="01:03:07.400" style="s2">continue to aspire to I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.869" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">they&#39;ll never be I&#39;ll never be completed</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.400" end="01:03:14.029" style="s2">at whatever that thing is I&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:17.690" style="s2">have arrived at wise precisely because</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.029" end="01:03:20.989" style="s2">I&#39;ll be going home with myself and like</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.690" end="01:03:28.430" style="s2">stubbing my toe get bad you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.989" end="01:03:35.049" style="s2">like and so that notion of aspiration</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.430" end="01:03:37.460" style="s2">that there&#39;s they said that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.049" end="01:03:41.089" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have necessarily all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.460" end="01:03:41.690" style="s2">the tools and we can&#39;t with each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.089" end="01:03:44.509" style="s2">in person</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.690" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">for instance which I also agree would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.509" end="01:03:52.640" style="s2">a wonderful thing we are facing these</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:54.859" style="s2">limitations now and so the wisdom to me</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.640" end="01:04:01.670" style="s2">would be would suggest well what tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.859" end="01:04:04.910" style="s2">can we bring to bear and to what end or</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.670" end="01:04:08.029" style="s2">how can we open use those tool tools to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.910" end="01:04:10.819" style="s2">open into possibilities beyond them so</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.029" end="01:04:13.489" style="s2">we have the understanding that the local</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.819" end="01:04:16.789" style="s2">level is so important for many people</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.489" end="01:04:23.089" style="s2">the local level is not one they may be</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.789" end="01:04:28.460" style="s2">able to engage with that much maybe they</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.089" end="01:04:32.059" style="s2">can doesn&#39;t feel particularly community</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.460" end="01:04:37.730" style="s2">in an apartment with slow moving lives</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.059" end="01:04:39.440" style="s2">and you know many all around it feels</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.730" end="01:04:40.489" style="s2">like if you&#39;re in lift with someone you</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.440" end="01:04:41.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be in a lift at them</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.489" end="01:04:47.559" style="s2">because you probably don&#39;t want to be in</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.960" end="01:04:50.779" style="s2">a lift with them so how can we answer</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.559" end="01:04:53.539" style="s2">just to add one one piece as well as ISA</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.779" end="01:04:55.220" style="s2">on this religion it&#39;s been the therapy</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.539" end="01:04:57.829" style="s2">and the tactics I think something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.220" end="01:04:59.779" style="s2">taking place here which is there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.829" end="01:05:02.150" style="s2">additional elements taking place here</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.779" end="01:05:03.890" style="s2">that might not be taking place as this</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.150" end="01:05:05.269" style="s2">was perhaps just you and I peas are</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.890" end="01:05:10.940" style="s2">having a conversation and wasn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.269" end="01:05:13.380" style="s2">recorded so of you know everyone here</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.940" end="01:05:15.750" style="s2">only pizza I only have had</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.380" end="01:05:17.640" style="s2">conversations with pizza before 1:00 and</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.750" end="01:05:19.980" style="s2">so there&#39;s a sense in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.640" end="01:05:21.480" style="s2">meeting each other for the first time</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.980" end="01:05:25.170" style="s2">ago we are aware of each other and</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.480" end="01:05:28.140" style="s2">there&#39;s the dance of tuning in to a</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.170" end="01:05:30.960" style="s2">shared and resonance a shared language</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.140" end="01:05:32.700" style="s2">at the Shedd frequency band supported</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.960" end="01:05:36.930" style="s2">from which we could begin to be tactical</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.700" end="01:05:38.490" style="s2">has to be dropped into this other piece</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.930" end="01:05:40.320" style="s2">that what we&#39;re doing here because</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.490" end="01:05:42.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a mindset that we may release</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.320" end="01:05:45.480" style="s2">this for the benefit there is a modeling</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.690" end="01:05:47.880" style="s2">of that process which is like an extra</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.480" end="01:05:49.320" style="s2">level of of abstraction really although</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.880" end="01:05:50.640" style="s2">not necessarily because if we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.320" end="01:05:53.610" style="s2">gathering in community there will be</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.640" end="01:05:56.550" style="s2">people there who are less able to open</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.610" end="01:05:59.280" style="s2">into that space and need to see from</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.550" end="01:06:02.940" style="s2">others there how they can hold</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.280" end="01:06:07.260" style="s2">themselves and invite participation in</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.940" end="01:06:11.480" style="s2">that shared voice too so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.260" end="01:06:15.350" style="s2">beautiful question to feel into how</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.480" end="01:06:17.400" style="s2">moving from that there are the tactics</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.350" end="01:06:20.820" style="s2">because the therapy in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.400" end="01:06:22.470" style="s2">anchors us in this sense of care what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.820" end="01:06:24.150" style="s2">should be really caring about I&#39;ll be in</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.470" end="01:06:26.120" style="s2">touch with that and then the tactics are</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.150" end="01:06:29.580" style="s2">how should we make sense of how to</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.120" end="01:06:33.450" style="s2">realize that which enables further care</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.580" end="01:06:35.040" style="s2">to take place or or I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.450" end="01:06:38.010" style="s2">all about care necessary that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.040" end="01:06:40.200" style="s2">crucial part but there&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.010" end="01:06:42.120" style="s2">the curiosity and the exploration and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.200" end="01:06:43.710" style="s2">the courage to stride out and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.120" end="01:06:45.030" style="s2">sense in which that&#39;s risk but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.710" end="01:06:46.250" style="s2">care for the whole so they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.030" end="01:06:48.570" style="s2">related</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.250" end="01:06:55.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s some pieces I thought I just</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.570" end="01:06:59.910" style="s2">throw into the mint hmm you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.970" end="01:07:03.690" style="s2">feel like there&#39;s attack the tactician</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.910" end="01:07:05.120" style="s2">in me I was wanting to systematize some</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.690" end="01:07:11.610" style="s2">of this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.120" end="01:07:13.500" style="s2">Peter you&#39;ve invoked that and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.610" end="01:07:16.500" style="s2">interesting thing here is that this</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.500" end="01:07:19.890" style="s2">conversation we started from a place of</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.500" end="01:07:23.940" style="s2">space and kind of contained many</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.890" end="01:07:25.020" style="s2">perspectives and emotions and explored</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.940" end="01:07:27.520" style="s2">how they connected and everything like</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.020" end="01:07:30.680" style="s2">that and I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">the residents that was reached here was</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.680" end="01:07:36.350" style="s2">because all of these things were part of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:43.130" style="s2">consideration and from my perspective I</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.350" end="01:07:44.870" style="s2">see using these ways of experiencing as</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.130" end="01:07:50.930" style="s2">a heuristic to see when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.870" end="01:07:53.030" style="s2">space is there a over resistance or a</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.930" end="01:07:55.130" style="s2">blind spot that&#39;s that&#39;s present right</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.030" end="01:08:00.800" style="s2">so some people might be with their gut</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.130" end="01:08:02.630" style="s2">this sense of Terror of fear and one way</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.800" end="01:08:05.140" style="s2">to do to do something with that is maybe</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.630" end="01:08:07.190" style="s2">if they have some shame about it</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.140" end="01:08:08.960" style="s2">reciprocating and allowing to have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.190" end="01:08:11.450" style="s2">cathartic experience with them is</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.960" end="01:08:14.090" style="s2">available if it doesn&#39;t feel like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.450" end="01:08:16.370" style="s2">it&#39;s open we can start to include</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.090" end="01:08:18.230" style="s2">something else you know and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.370" end="01:08:19.850" style="s2">if fear is what comes from the gut then</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.230" end="01:08:21.260" style="s2">love is what comes from the heart and</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.850" end="01:08:24.050" style="s2">moving in that heart direction is</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.260" end="01:08:27.140" style="s2">interesting if somebody is limited by</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.050" end="01:08:30.890" style="s2">their ideological frame and can&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.140" end="01:08:32.240" style="s2">outside of it maybe that means we pulled</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.890" end="01:08:33.830" style="s2">them into their heart pull them into</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.240" end="01:08:35.900" style="s2">their gut you know hey you guys what</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.830" end="01:08:38.810" style="s2">you&#39;re alive and you better start doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.900" end="01:08:41.270" style="s2">something you know these are they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.810" end="01:08:42.859" style="s2">know this this the mind state that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.270" end="01:08:46.930" style="s2">very that were resistant to his</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.859" end="01:08:49.730" style="s2">confusion so you know also bringing a</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.930" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">and okayness with confusion like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.730" end="01:08:52.970" style="s2">that&#39;s totally normally confuse I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:55.570" style="s2">confused too so that we don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.970" end="01:08:59.270" style="s2">an ashamed of our emotional reactions</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.570" end="01:09:02.510" style="s2">and trying to kind of in each space that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.270" end="01:09:05.270" style="s2">we interact broaden the perspective to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.510" end="01:09:07.670" style="s2">help include more parts of the picture</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.270" end="01:09:11.270" style="s2">for the individuals or groups or whoever</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.670" end="01:09:15.170" style="s2">it is it might be a something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.270" end="01:09:18.109" style="s2">coming to me so yeah you need to affirm</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.170" end="01:09:21.109" style="s2">the heart affirm the gut and and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.109" end="01:09:27.190" style="s2">mind or expand it or move somewhere else</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.109" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">or or be okay with the way it is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.190" end="01:09:30.740" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a myriad of ways of</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:34.100" style="s2">interacting with each of those those</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.740" end="01:09:36.859" style="s2">basins so I have the believes</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.100" end="01:09:41.180" style="s2">unfortunately but before I do</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.859" end="01:09:43.339" style="s2">direction going off what you&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.180" end="01:09:48.850" style="s2">Jared direction I want to move in I</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.339" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">guess I would call grounded envisioning</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.850" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">and what I mean by that is you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:59.650" style="s2">they&#39;re so you know there&#39;s expression</p>

<p begin="01:10:58.190" end="01:11:05.330" style="s2">immediate relationships you know in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.880" end="01:11:07.550" style="s2">environment you know can I can I grow</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.330" end="01:11:10.490" style="s2">some plants for example or plant a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.550" end="01:11:13.240" style="s2">little garden you know that&#39;s small but</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.490" end="01:11:18.290" style="s2">I think it&#39;s gesturing us towards a</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.240" end="01:11:21.080" style="s2">longer-term grounding in you know this</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.290" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t this is gonna keep happening and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.080" end="01:11:27.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just gonna get worse that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:30.010" style="s2">my prediction you could you know and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.530" end="01:11:33.080" style="s2">so I think we all need to think about</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.010" end="01:11:35.300" style="s2">what is our five-year vision and for</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.080" end="01:11:37.910" style="s2">example or two-year vision of what kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.300" end="01:11:40.400" style="s2">of community we want to build and if we</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.910" end="01:11:41.780" style="s2">can&#39;t build it where we are if it just</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.400" end="01:11:45.350" style="s2">seems impossible then we should move</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.780" end="01:11:50.679" style="s2">like we like we need to start developing</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.350" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">real logistical mutual aid communities</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.679" end="01:11:54.610" style="s2">you know either where we are or</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:58.659" style="s2">somewhere else and so there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.610" end="01:12:00.280" style="s2">duel you know now it&#39;s like okay you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.659" end="01:12:03.550" style="s2">know let me prepare the ground for that</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.280" end="01:12:07.420" style="s2">but then if this lets up how can I</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.550" end="01:12:11.320" style="s2">orient my life to you know the next time</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.420" end="01:12:14.739" style="s2">this happens which it will how will I be</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.320" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">in a in a better you know a situation to</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.739" end="01:12:22.330" style="s2">to really live out my values right so I</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:25.260" style="s2">think that&#39;s at least that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.330" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">of where I&#39;m I&#39;m at now</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.260" end="01:12:32.560" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s um so I know you have to go</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:35.349" style="s2">soon Jason so my kind of closing</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.560" end="01:12:37.290" style="s2">thoughts and a couple things I got from</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.349" end="01:12:39.909" style="s2">this conversation which I quite liked</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.290" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">one of them like you know the whole term</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.909" end="01:12:43.989" style="s2">the meta-crisis I used to I loved that</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:46.300" style="s2">term you know cuz it&#39;s like it felt so</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.989" end="01:12:49.090" style="s2">compositionally like rich by the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.300" end="01:12:51.310" style="s2">time it was like so disembodied you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.090" end="01:12:53.949" style="s2">I had that kind of like that only meta</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.310" end="01:12:56.380" style="s2">nerds with geek out about that term but</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.949" end="01:12:58.599" style="s2">like the meta crisis has come online and</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.380" end="01:13:00.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s like the thought that the meta</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.599" end="01:13:03.929" style="s2">crisis coming online has awakened us</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.340" end="01:13:06.940" style="s2">from the meaning crisis it&#39;s pretty cool</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.929" end="01:13:08.800" style="s2">and the other thing about the whole kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.940" end="01:13:12.340" style="s2">of tribalism it&#39;s like it&#39;s bifurcated</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.800" end="01:13:14.409" style="s2">in my mind is that I might be leaving</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.340" end="01:13:15.730" style="s2">Toronto soon to go up north the family</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.409" end="01:13:17.139" style="s2">cottage and that&#39;s one place where I</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.730" end="01:13:18.849" style="s2">want to build community with the people</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.139" end="01:13:21.460" style="s2">there and with this kind of the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.849" end="01:13:23.320" style="s2">of localism and how can we sustain a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.460" end="01:13:25.000" style="s2">community there but then there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.320" end="01:13:28.060" style="s2">this meta tribe that we have right here</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.000" end="01:13:30.310" style="s2">and I think this is those like two</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.060" end="01:13:32.679" style="s2">tribes forming and I feel like or I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.310" end="01:13:37.300" style="s2">like to be in touch with you guys and be</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.679" end="01:13:38.949" style="s2">more close and feel as embodiment and</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.300" end="01:13:45.040" style="s2">how can these two tribes like talk to</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.949" end="01:13:47.969" style="s2">each other yeah yeah so that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.040" end="01:13:47.969" style="s2">leaving with</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.979" end="01:13:59.570" style="s2">you know I might just I might just add</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.630" end="01:14:01.610" style="s2">to that real briefly I think in a way</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.570" end="01:14:05.059" style="s2">that these two different worlds or</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.610" end="01:14:07.670" style="s2">tribes can can bridge is I do think</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.059" end="01:14:09.709" style="s2">developing these relationships online is</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.670" end="01:14:13.670" style="s2">incredibly rich and credibly important</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.709" end="01:14:15.650" style="s2">and I think by doing that we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.670" end="01:14:20.900" style="s2">affording ourselves potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.650" end="01:14:26.209" style="s2">opportunities to eventually create you</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.900" end="01:14:27.979" style="s2">know the meatspace communities I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.209" end="01:14:32.300" style="s2">think of a good term in real life it</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.979" end="01:14:35.090" style="s2">sounds bad meatspace sounds bad I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.300" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">recognizing how bad meets a sense yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.090" end="01:14:39.249" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:39.249" style="s2">well I mean for calling it might be that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.950" end="01:14:48.679" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>

<p begin="01:15:33.920" end="01:15:44.389" style="s2">think the dynamic pizza that you allude</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.300" end="01:15:48.559" style="s2">to there the mental tribe the non the</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.389" end="01:15:52.489" style="s2">non local tribe and then adjacent also</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.559" end="01:15:55.670" style="s2">having this this realization and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.489" end="01:15:59.449" style="s2">one I very much share that movement</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.670" end="01:16:02.769" style="s2">towards resiliency at a local level it</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.449" end="01:16:02.769" style="s2">is so so important and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.670" end="01:16:11.949" style="s2">not sure how long that would take to</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.040" end="01:16:13.510" style="s2">occur for for myself well in different</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.949" end="01:16:15.520" style="s2">situations there when it comes to what</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:21.340" style="s2">our local options are but it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.520" end="01:16:23.440" style="s2">I&#39;m very much interested in yet I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.340" end="01:16:27.310" style="s2">interested also in this connection</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.440" end="01:16:32.140" style="s2">between because we are local and</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.310" end="01:16:35.290" style="s2">non-local it seems to me man the grenade</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.140" end="01:16:38.920" style="s2">relationality the modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.290" end="01:16:41.640" style="s2">in relationship perhaps are perhaps are</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.920" end="01:16:44.020" style="s2">the same you know maybe we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.640" end="01:16:46.120" style="s2">capacities to express with our body and</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.290" end="01:16:53.590" style="s2">and pace and talk to each other you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.300" end="01:16:59.469" style="s2">no there are different limitations but</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.590" end="01:17:03.580" style="s2">fundamentally when I am tuned in and go</p>

<p begin="01:18:20.220" end="01:18:30.750" style="s2">common metaphors that we use is this the</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:34.680" style="s2">the blind monks or whatever all feeling</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.750" end="01:18:37.650" style="s2">the elephant right like the truth the</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.680" end="01:18:41.250" style="s2">reality and each of them at a different</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.650" end="01:18:47.210" style="s2">place and having a completely different</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.250" end="01:18:49.770" style="s2">experience of what this elephant is and</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.210" end="01:18:52.260" style="s2">the way that they investigate is</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.770" end="01:18:57.030" style="s2">different the way that they share is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.260" end="01:18:59.640" style="s2">different and I kind of feel like these</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.030" end="01:19:02.070" style="s2">conversations online are a lot of what</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.640" end="01:19:04.320" style="s2">the doing is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s us yelling</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.070" end="01:19:07.130" style="s2">at each other from the other side okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.320" end="01:19:10.170" style="s2">it&#39;s also it looks like this over here</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.130" end="01:19:12.420" style="s2">and and being like genuinely interested</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.170" end="01:19:15.410" style="s2">in everybody&#39;s perspective because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.420" end="01:19:19.350" style="s2">like adding something to the picture and</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.410" end="01:19:21.450" style="s2">that being said some people could jump</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.350" end="01:19:24.270" style="s2">straight into there in a place where</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.450" end="01:19:26.430" style="s2">they there&#39;s a lot of solidity not a lot</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.270" end="01:19:28.230" style="s2">of movement and it&#39;s time for them to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.430" end="01:19:32.160" style="s2">get grounded in in a space in a locality</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.230" end="01:19:34.140" style="s2">and some people might be in a place</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.160" end="01:19:37.460" style="s2">that&#39;s moving and changing but that</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.140" end="01:19:41.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t lend to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.460" end="01:19:44.010" style="s2">generation the triangulation of what</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.370" end="01:19:47.160" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here so yeah I had employed</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.010" end="01:19:49.920" style="s2">everybody to kind of try to find the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.160" end="01:19:55.410" style="s2">ways to be useful and it will be</p>
