<p begin="00:00:00.319" end="00:00:05.580" style="s2">one way of framing it is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:10.260" style="s2">smack dab in the middle of a global</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.580" end="00:00:11.429" style="s2">scale civilization level collapse now if</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.260" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">we do our job right it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.429" end="00:00:16.199" style="s2">transition to something else but right</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">now we&#39;re you know collapse is a good</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.199" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">way of thinking about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">and what I mean by global scale is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">for the very first time in human history</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:27.510" style="s2">starting somewhere or maybe in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">all human beings were roughly and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.510" end="00:00:33.199" style="s2">trained in a single civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:33.199" style="s2">framework that&#39;s never happened before</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:41.230" style="s2">so so to begin what I would like to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.309" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">is I would like to express my personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.230" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">thanks to president Donald James Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.620" end="00:00:54.820" style="s2">no I&#39;m I&#39;m serious because the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.399" end="00:00:56.440" style="s2">election did more to shake good people</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.820" end="00:00:59.739" style="s2">from the dogmatic slumbers than any</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.440" end="00:01:01.750" style="s2">event that I am aware yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.739" end="00:01:03.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s actually been a very big</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.750" end="00:01:06.729" style="s2">deal I&#39;ve felt a significant increase in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.820" end="00:01:09.580" style="s2">energy it significant increase in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.729" end="00:01:10.990" style="s2">willingness to accept the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.580" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">best way to describe our current</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.990" end="00:01:17.619" style="s2">circumstances is that is up</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:19.539" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a deep insight because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.619" end="00:01:21.819" style="s2">recognizes simultaneously that things</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.539" end="00:01:23.440" style="s2">aren&#39;t working and we haven&#39;t got a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.819" end="00:01:26.319" style="s2">way of describing exactly what is going</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.440" end="00:01:28.149" style="s2">wrong and that&#39;s like the first step to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.319" end="00:01:30.850" style="s2">real wisdom so it&#39;s a good thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.149" end="00:01:32.039" style="s2">that&#39;s happening we&#39;re gonna spend a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.850" end="00:01:34.630" style="s2">little bit of time trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.039" end="00:01:37.060" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been doing and trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.630" end="00:01:39.939" style="s2">some frameworks around what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.060" end="00:01:44.170" style="s2"> up might mean and how we might go</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.939" end="00:01:48.039" style="s2">about visioning what a good positive</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.170" end="00:01:50.229" style="s2">direction might look like and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.039" end="00:01:52.090" style="s2">start I think with just a short piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.229" end="00:01:54.490" style="s2">and then Daniel will go into some depth</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.090" end="00:01:57.549" style="s2">on the nature of the problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.490" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">Forest will actually introduce us to an</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.549" end="00:02:04.600" style="s2">example of what a piece of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:09.549" style="s2">likely looks like and something that he</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.600" end="00:02:11.890" style="s2">calls transcendental design so one way</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.549" end="00:02:14.609" style="s2">of framing it is that we are smack dab</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.890" end="00:02:18.519" style="s2">in the middle of a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.609" end="00:02:20.290" style="s2">civilization level collapse now if we do</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.519" end="00:02:23.230" style="s2">our job right it will be a transition to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.290" end="00:02:24.519" style="s2">something else but right now we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.230" end="00:02:26.890" style="s2">know collapse is a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.519" end="00:02:28.930" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening and what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.890" end="00:02:30.790" style="s2">by global scale is that for the very</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.930" end="00:02:33.489" style="s2">first time in human history starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.790" end="00:02:36.340" style="s2">somewhere or maybe in the 80s all human</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.489" end="00:02:38.739" style="s2">beings were roughly and trained in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.340" end="00:02:39.579" style="s2">single civilization framework that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.739" end="00:02:43.510" style="s2">never happened before</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.579" end="00:02:45.940" style="s2">and then now that civilization framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.510" end="00:02:47.550" style="s2">is reaching its end of life and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.940" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">mean by civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.550" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">roughly the things like the the axioms</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">the assumptions the heuristics the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:58.440" style="s2">models the practices the institutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">that we humans use to solve problems and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.440" end="00:03:05.750" style="s2">to make our meet our needs so whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:08.370" style="s2">this means things like go to college or</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.750" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">get a job at a company and get paid</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.370" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">money to buy food or go to a grocery</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">store to get food right these are all</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">the things that our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">produces to allow us to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:22.350" style="s2">and get our needs met and an insight and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.900" style="s2">I think a core thing for more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.350" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">people to really grasp is that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.900" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">civilization toolkit this thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">gotten us so far this thing that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:33.300" style="s2">produced seven and a half billion people</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">on a level of capacity and wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.300" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">well-being that&#39;s never been seen before</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">is itself the thing that is reached its</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:43.080" style="s2">end it just can&#39;t solve the problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:44.670" style="s2">that we&#39;re facing and by the way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.080" end="00:03:46.520" style="s2">also falling apart under its own terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.670" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">but that&#39;s a different conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.520" end="00:03:52.190" style="s2">so what we have to do is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">figure out first how to unload that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.190" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2">toolkit unload our assumptions unload</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:58.380" style="s2">the things that have worked so well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.730" end="00:04:01.080" style="s2">get all the way down to the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.380" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">and rebuild something kind of from</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.080" end="00:04:05.670" style="s2">scratch and we&#39;re gonna have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.440" style="s2">very rapidly so this involves something</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.670" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">that we&#39;ve never done before as a people</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.440" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">it&#39;s going to require a level of vision</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">it&#39;s going to acquire a level of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:17.880" style="s2">communion it&#39;s going to require a level</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:19.709" style="s2">of peace that is I mean largely is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.880" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">considered to be fiction or prophecy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.709" end="00:04:25.620" style="s2">now it&#39;s not now it is in fact minimum</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:27.330" style="s2">necessary requirements which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.620" end="00:04:29.669" style="s2">an interesting thing you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.330" end="00:04:31.470" style="s2">I find myself sitting Daniel and I work</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.669" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">together in a business and sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.470" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">the room having a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:36.660" style="s2">business E things and I&#39;ll just reflect</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.520" style="s2">and say gosh last night as having</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.660" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">conversations with people that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:42.900" style="s2">quite like Oh than the next seven years</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">our oceans will just be dead and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.900" end="00:04:47.190" style="s2">the clock and these are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.190" end="00:04:51.990" style="s2">outside the Daniel wants to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:53.700" style="s2">that as we&#39;re communicating that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.990" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">are left here with the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.700" end="00:04:59.010" style="s2">empowerment and not a sense of panic or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:00.510" style="s2">fear and what I&#39;d like to convey is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.010" end="00:05:03.420" style="s2">sense of resolve</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.510" end="00:05:06.210" style="s2">which is recognized that we must in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.420" end="00:05:08.220" style="s2">actually step in and that fear and panic</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.210" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">although they may be a very natural</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.220" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">response just aren&#39;t a useful response</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:14.910" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s that part now I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:15.900" style="s2">think most what we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.910" end="00:05:18.660" style="s2">talking about is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:19.980" style="s2">intellectual that is not to say that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.660" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">believe that the solution is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.980" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">even largely intellectual there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:25.980" style="s2">piece for the mind to play but in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">some of the questions that came from</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">Facebook the basic answer is heart so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:31.140" style="s2">think this is a great place to begin the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.090" end="00:05:34.470" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.140" end="00:05:37.080" style="s2">I guess publicly one concept that I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.470" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">like to download before I hand off to</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.080" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">Daniel is a framework that a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">mine Dave Snowden not Ed Snowden but</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.190" style="s2">Dave stone</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:48.390" style="s2">introduced about 10 years ago for</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.190" end="00:05:50.010" style="s2">thinking about the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.390" end="00:05:52.170" style="s2">ordered systems that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.010" end="00:05:53.640" style="s2">in all right so you ready this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.170" end="00:05:55.040" style="s2">intellectual framework but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.640" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">can do it quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.040" end="00:06:01.320" style="s2">the first kind of system is a simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:04.290" style="s2">system and this is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.320" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">way a pendulum swings back and forth or</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.290" end="00:06:09.810" style="s2">a game of tic-tac-toe where then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:12.420" style="s2">phase space which is the the state the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.810" end="00:06:14.010" style="s2">set of available states in the system is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.420" end="00:06:16.200" style="s2">relatively small like the total number</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.010" end="00:06:17.730" style="s2">of tic-tac-toe games and can fit on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.200" end="00:06:19.830" style="s2">page it&#39;s not that many things and so</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.810" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">understand what to do and master it so</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.180" end="00:06:31.080" style="s2">complicated system is the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:32.910" style="s2">that we humans our civilization is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">very good at building and these are</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.910" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">things like say the Boeing 777 or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.810" style="s2">national energy grid or interstate</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:42.480" style="s2">highway system things that are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.810" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">large face this is a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.480" end="00:06:48.180" style="s2">states the system is able to handle so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:50.250" style="s2">much more that no person can ever really</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.180" end="00:06:52.200" style="s2">grasp them in their entirety you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.250" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">never master them but if you spend</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.200" end="00:06:55.260" style="s2">enough time with them you can build up</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:57.240" style="s2">an expertise and understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.260" end="00:06:59.700" style="s2">states are and how they interact and if</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.240" end="00:07:01.770" style="s2">you get a crew of people who are all</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.700" end="00:07:04.230" style="s2">experts in the system you can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.770" end="00:07:05.940" style="s2">manage it and that idea this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.230" end="00:07:08.490" style="s2">becoming experts and managing</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.940" end="00:07:11.730" style="s2">complicated systems is a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.490" end="00:07:13.710" style="s2">succinctly of framing what we do what</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.730" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">our civilization is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.710" end="00:07:17.910" style="s2">good at doing now the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:20.130" style="s2">complicated systems that distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.910" end="00:07:22.710" style="s2">them from complex systems as although</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.130" end="00:07:24.870" style="s2">the phase space is very large it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.710" end="00:07:27.000" style="s2">change so once you&#39;ve figured out the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.870" end="00:07:29.100" style="s2">Boeing 777 you can print out the whole</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.000" end="00:07:31.650" style="s2">manual put it aside and look it up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.100" end="00:07:34.290" style="s2">then and that&#39;s that in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.650" end="00:07:37.200" style="s2">things do change now it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.290" end="00:07:39.420" style="s2">about complex systems is on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.200" end="00:07:41.490" style="s2">it&#39;s only been about three or four</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.420" end="00:07:44.190" style="s2">decades that we&#39;ve even been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.490" end="00:07:46.470" style="s2">about them seriously like the name isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.190" end="00:07:47.910" style="s2">even more than three decades old we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.470" end="00:07:48.900" style="s2">just really beginning to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.910" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">what these things are and how they</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.900" end="00:07:54.480" style="s2">operate and on the other hand things</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:56.820" style="s2">like our bodies our minds or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.480" end="00:07:59.460" style="s2">relationships or ecology our economies</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.820" end="00:08:00.840" style="s2">those are all complex systems which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.460" end="00:08:03.630" style="s2">to say all the stuff we actually care</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.840" end="00:08:05.190" style="s2">about is complex and a big part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.630" end="00:08:07.650" style="s2">game that we&#39;ve been playing as people</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.190" end="00:08:10.140" style="s2">for the past fifteen thousand years at</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.650" end="00:08:14.190" style="s2">least has been trying to use complicated</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.140" end="00:08:16.290" style="s2">stuff to manage complex stuff and this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.190" end="00:08:19.350" style="s2">generates a real problem you see in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.290" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">complex system things like causation is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.350" end="00:08:23.790" style="s2">are almost impossible to really figure</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:25.650" style="s2">out you can&#39;t make predictions with</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.790" end="00:08:27.510" style="s2">precision but exactly what your impact</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.650" end="00:08:29.580" style="s2">is going to have on the system feedback</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.510" end="00:08:31.650" style="s2">loops feed-forward loops emergent</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:33.510" style="s2">properties new capacities that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.650" end="00:08:37.530" style="s2">even exist evolution these are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.510" end="00:08:39.330" style="s2">characteristics of complexity and one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.530" end="00:08:41.730" style="s2">the big problems and in some sense a</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.330" end="00:08:43.370" style="s2">nature of the the problem were facing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.730" end="00:08:46.380" style="s2">that when you have a complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.370" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">trying to manage a complex system as the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.380" end="00:08:50.460" style="s2">complex system changes which is what</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.260" style="s2">it&#39;s going to do the complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.460" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">has to become more complicated to deal</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.260" end="00:08:57.000" style="s2">with the the failure modes and so it</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:08:58.140" style="s2">gets more and more complicated and more</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.000" end="00:09:00.120" style="s2">and more complicated until eventually</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.140" end="00:09:01.800" style="s2">it&#39;s so complicated that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.120" end="00:09:03.840" style="s2">manage it and then it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.800" end="00:09:06.960" style="s2">something that Dave student calls takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.840" end="00:09:09.960" style="s2">a journey through chaos and chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.960" end="00:09:12.780" style="s2">fourth kind of system and we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.960" end="00:09:14.790" style="s2">chaos chaos is generally a very sad</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.780" end="00:09:16.200" style="s2">place to be and we might even want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.790" end="00:09:18.600" style="s2">say that we don&#39;t want to take a journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.200" end="00:09:19.950" style="s2">through chaos but it seems unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.600" end="00:09:22.110" style="s2">rather unlikely we&#39;re going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.950" end="00:09:25.170" style="s2">to do that because every single time a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.110" end="00:09:27.070" style="s2">truly complicated system has to adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.170" end="00:09:28.900" style="s2">a complexity can&#39;t manage</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.070" end="00:09:31.090" style="s2">the way that it breaks down is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.900" end="00:09:32.620" style="s2">disorderly and it goes through chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.090" end="00:09:35.650" style="s2">then you come back into authentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.620" end="00:09:38.530" style="s2">complexity so it might be the case and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.650" end="00:09:42.220" style="s2">something to consider that our job right</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.530" end="00:09:44.830" style="s2">now is twofold first is to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">how to position ourselves so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.830" end="00:09:49.270" style="s2">in fact endure the chaos possibly you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:51.370" style="s2">can be anti fragile to the chaos and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.270" end="00:09:54.430" style="s2">use the chaos to build something very</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.370" end="00:09:57.880" style="s2">positive and then second to do what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.430" end="00:09:59.910" style="s2">can now to envision what a future looks</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.880" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">like that embraces complexity</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.910" end="00:10:04.270" style="s2">authentically and does not retain</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:06.250" style="s2">complexity but worked with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.270" end="00:10:07.180" style="s2">and build a civilization or whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.250" end="00:10:08.830" style="s2">would want to call it it may be</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.180" end="00:10:10.540" style="s2">something completely different that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.830" end="00:10:11.770" style="s2">directly related to the natural dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.540" end="00:10:18.670" style="s2">of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.770" end="00:10:22.030" style="s2">okay so Jordan used the word anti</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.670" end="00:10:26.710" style="s2">fragile which means resilient if we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.030" end="00:10:28.150" style="s2">get the gain down a little bit but more</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.710" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">than just resilient it means that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">things come up that are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:34.330" style="s2">deviations from the homeo dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:36.430" style="s2">that system it&#39;s not only going to not</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.330" end="00:10:37.780" style="s2">break but it&#39;s going to be able to learn</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.430" end="00:10:39.160" style="s2">from them and the system&#39;s gonna evolve</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.780" end="00:10:42.720" style="s2">you mentioned that complex systems are</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.160" end="00:10:45.640" style="s2">evolving so complicated systems are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.720" end="00:10:47.710" style="s2">self-organizing right the 747 is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">designed externally design thing as</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.710" end="00:10:51.580" style="s2">opposed to a self-organizing an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">thing that&#39;s another key distinction you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.580" end="00:10:55.510" style="s2">notice that our human civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:57.310" style="s2">systems are macro economic systems the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.510" end="00:10:58.540" style="s2">way we think about putting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.310" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">principles of them together our</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.540" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">governance systems especially our</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:03.700" style="s2">infrastructure are complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:07.500" style="s2">but they interface with the complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.700" end="00:11:09.910" style="s2">systems of ecology of human psyches of</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.500" end="00:11:11.830" style="s2">social you know human social dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.910" end="00:11:14.620" style="s2">and the behavioral dynamics of economies</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.830" end="00:11:16.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s important to get that our</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.620" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">built world or human built world is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.840" end="00:11:22.030" style="s2">anti fragile it&#39;s not self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:24.430" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s it is fragile to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.030" end="00:11:26.950" style="s2">collapse and we&#39;ve seen this if we look</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.430" end="00:11:29.590" style="s2">at civilizations throughout history they</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.950" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">didn&#39;t all fare well right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.590" end="00:11:33.400" style="s2">important to get that because since we</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t go through Easter Island and we</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.400" end="00:11:36.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t go through the collapse of most</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">of the things that were called</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.790" end="00:11:39.400" style="s2">civilizations in the past and in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:41.320" style="s2">life we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.400" end="00:11:43.450" style="s2">to that at all we don&#39;t actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.320" end="00:11:46.120" style="s2">experiential intuition for really</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.450" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">breaking down and so it seems like that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.120" end="00:11:49.420" style="s2">just couldn&#39;t really happen intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:51.160" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t been exposed to it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.420" end="00:11:54.090" style="s2">intuition is conditioned by our</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.160" end="00:11:56.710" style="s2">experience our intuition is not adequate</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.090" end="00:11:58.270" style="s2">right our experiential intuition is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.710" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">adequate for the scope of what we face</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.270" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">this is a super important topic and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.510" end="00:12:07.690" style="s2">when we look at Syria we see that their</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:09.130" style="s2">complicated system right there their</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.690" end="00:12:11.860" style="s2">governance system their infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.130" end="00:12:14.140" style="s2">has radically collapsed we see that it</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.860" end="00:12:15.700" style="s2">was complex dynamics that led to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.140" end="00:12:17.350" style="s2">collapse of that scenario and the lack</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.350" end="00:12:21.220" style="s2">who are there lots of complex right</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.780" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">there were economic motives there were</p>

<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:28.630" style="s2">motives but there were also droughts</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.110" end="00:12:30.910" style="s2">that were most likely the result of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.630" end="00:12:32.650" style="s2">climate change that led to subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.910" end="00:12:33.910" style="s2">farmers not being able to grow food that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.650" end="00:12:36.250" style="s2">led to them coming into the cities that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.910" end="00:12:37.870" style="s2">led to resource collapse resource Wars</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.250" end="00:12:40.650" style="s2">that then collapse a complicated systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.870" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">right this is complex system failure</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.650" end="00:12:45.370" style="s2">creating breakdown of the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.260" style="s2">systems that we depend upon so this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.370" end="00:12:51.550" style="s2">when Jordans saying that our previous</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.260" end="00:12:54.130" style="s2">toolkit isn&#39;t adequate more complicated</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.130" end="00:12:59.740" style="s2">right that&#39;s one aspect I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:02.080" style="s2">about another part of our toolkit that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.740" end="00:13:03.940" style="s2">has to change which is our motivational</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.080" end="00:13:06.130" style="s2">toolkit right not just our design</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.940" end="00:13:08.200" style="s2">toolkit but our motivational toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.130" end="00:13:10.150" style="s2">what we think of as you know the game</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.200" end="00:13:15.850" style="s2">theoretic or the behavioral mechanics in</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.150" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">it so we&#39;ve we can think about phases</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.850" end="00:13:20.350" style="s2">that civilization has gone through many</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.450" end="00:13:21.790" style="s2">people have brought up the point right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.350" end="00:13:23.470" style="s2">when Gandhi was asked what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.790" end="00:13:27.460" style="s2">of Western civilization he said I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.470" end="00:13:29.170" style="s2">it would be a good idea and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.460" end="00:13:31.420" style="s2">actually a meaningful point right</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.170" end="00:13:32.890" style="s2">because he&#39;s saying it and and Jacque</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.420" end="00:13:35.560" style="s2">fresco has famously said this many</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.890" end="00:13:37.840" style="s2">people&#39;s as long as homelessness is okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.560" end="00:13:39.490" style="s2">and you and you&#39;re gonna kind of focus</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.840" end="00:13:41.880" style="s2">on other stuff and as long as killing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.490" end="00:13:45.580" style="s2">each other is a reasonable solution to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.880" end="00:13:48.010" style="s2">conflict resolution is it fair to call</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.580" end="00:13:49.270" style="s2">that civilized yet or you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.010" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">fair to call it humanity isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.270" end="00:13:52.040" style="s2">humane so maybe civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.580" end="00:13:54.649" style="s2">humanity</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.040" end="00:13:57.290" style="s2">are terms that we are aspiring to we</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.649" end="00:13:59.630" style="s2">haven&#39;t got to yet and maybe the birth</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.290" end="00:14:01.910" style="s2">of civilization a term actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.630" end="00:14:05.480" style="s2">deserving of that is what is on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.910" end="00:14:08.870" style="s2">other side of this chaos if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.480" end="00:14:10.009" style="s2">navigate towards that so when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.870" end="00:14:11.180" style="s2">about the history of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.009" end="00:14:13.190" style="s2">usually we&#39;re talking about the history</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.180" end="00:14:14.810" style="s2">of empire post agriculture right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.190" end="00:14:18.649" style="s2">usually the timeframe that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.810" end="00:14:20.149" style="s2">about and when we when we look at phases</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.649" end="00:14:23.089" style="s2">right we&#39;ll call you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.149" end="00:14:25.790" style="s2">hunter-gatherer tribes and then groups</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.089" end="00:14:27.259" style="s2">of tribes and then fiefdoms and kingdoms</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.790" end="00:14:30.019" style="s2">and movements towards nation-states</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.259" end="00:14:31.190" style="s2">corporations globalism even though those</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.019" end="00:14:33.589" style="s2">were fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.190" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">organizational dynamics for some in</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.589" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">group to win at a competitive game for</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">scarce resources against some other out</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:42.709" style="s2">group they all had that in common they</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:44.810" style="s2">were all playing win-lose games that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.709" end="00:14:48.440" style="s2">fundamental to their game theory right</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.810" end="00:14:50.600" style="s2">so in-group out-group fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.440" end="00:14:56.569" style="s2">zero-sum win lose game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.600" end="00:14:58.910" style="s2">dynamics so if you disagree with people</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.569" end="00:15:01.130" style="s2">or you want the same resources that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.910" end="00:15:03.860" style="s2">scarce and so you decide to kill each</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.130" end="00:15:05.779" style="s2">other as a solution and you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.860" end="00:15:06.920" style="s2">with Spears</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.779" end="00:15:08.870" style="s2">you&#39;ll kill some people but not</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.920" end="00:15:11.959" style="s2">everybody and not the whole ecosystem if</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.870" end="00:15:13.880" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna race to pull out the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.959" end="00:15:16.940" style="s2">unremovable resources from the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.880" end="00:15:19.310" style="s2">fat faster but you are doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.940" end="00:15:22.220" style="s2">access you&#39;ll damage some ecosystems but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.310" end="00:15:24.500" style="s2">not all right but as your tools are</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.220" end="00:15:26.300" style="s2">going through exponential increases in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.500" end="00:15:30.050" style="s2">power in the capacity to affect the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.300" end="00:15:31.880" style="s2">world then the capacity to cause damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.050" end="00:15:36.050" style="s2">will actually leads to a place where win</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.880" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">lose becomes lose lose right when when</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.050" end="00:15:39.800" style="s2">you go from stone tools to guns to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:42.230" style="s2">missiles to weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.800" end="00:15:46.370" style="s2">there is no such thing as winning a war</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.230" end="00:15:48.220" style="s2">at that level and so when lose attempt</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.370" end="00:15:51.889" style="s2">becomes Omni lose-lose for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.220" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">right when you go towards racing towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.889" end="00:15:56.630" style="s2">who can extract the dwindling resources</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:58.279" style="s2">fast enough with the kinds of industrial</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.630" end="00:16:00.230" style="s2">technology that allow us to extract them</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.279" end="00:16:01.590" style="s2">so much faster than they can regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.230" end="00:16:04.170" style="s2">that&#39;s Omni lose-lose</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.590" end="00:16:07.760" style="s2">everybody so we&#39;re going through a shift</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.170" end="00:16:10.560" style="s2">where we either have lose lose</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.760" end="00:16:14.340" style="s2">motivational dynamics or Omni win-win</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.560" end="00:16:17.550" style="s2">and there&#39;s no spaces in between we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.340" end="00:16:20.460" style="s2">never had an omni win-win worldview</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.550" end="00:16:23.220" style="s2">right we had win for everybody in our</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.460" end="00:16:24.750" style="s2">civilization but usually not even that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.220" end="00:16:26.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like win for the ruling class and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.750" end="00:16:28.680" style="s2">the civilization at the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.760" end="00:16:31.380" style="s2">peasant classes that do all the work in</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.680" end="00:16:34.770" style="s2">the labor force etc so what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.380" end="00:16:36.600" style="s2">to really recognize that the level at</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.770" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">which we can affect each other because</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.600" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">of exponential technology requires that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:45.360" style="s2">we take full consideration for making</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:46.530" style="s2">sure that we&#39;re not externalizing harm</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.360" end="00:16:48.870" style="s2">with that effect on the planet that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.530" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">can&#39;t handle the externalization load</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.870" end="00:16:54.690" style="s2">anymore so you know we use the term Omni</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">considerate and obviously we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.690" end="00:16:57.270" style="s2">fully on the conserve but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.890" end="00:16:59.190" style="s2">directional to our moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.270" end="00:17:02.040" style="s2">direction of considering more so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.190" end="00:17:04.490" style="s2">there is no externality gap right we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.040" end="00:17:07.740" style="s2">say that the future of macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.490" end="00:17:10.320" style="s2">one of the defining criteria has to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.740" end="00:17:12.540" style="s2">that the incentive of every agent in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.540" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">of people has to be aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:19.290" style="s2">well-being of every other agent and of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:21.030" style="s2">the Commons and any place where someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.290" end="00:17:22.470" style="s2">is incentive to do something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.030" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">directly or indirectly causes harm</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.470" end="00:17:28.080" style="s2">somewhere else you cannot prevent harm</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:30.240" style="s2">that your incentive well a system that</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.080" end="00:17:32.280" style="s2">meets that criteria looks like no system</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.240" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">of economics that we have ever had it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.280" end="00:17:36.630" style="s2">not Marxism it&#39;s not socialism it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:40.020" style="s2">capitalism it&#39;s not a retrofit of any of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.630" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">those systems either now notice that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.020" end="00:17:46.050" style="s2">exponential tech which means the the</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.050" end="00:17:49.830" style="s2">more powerfully into it most people</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.940" end="00:17:51.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have an intuition that can make</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.510" end="00:17:58.350" style="s2">phase in the iteration can have as much</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:18:01.050" style="s2">change as the entire curve up to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.350" end="00:18:03.150" style="s2">point what that means is that the way we</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.050" end="00:18:05.720" style="s2">solve problems previously is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.150" end="00:18:08.250" style="s2">more and more obsolete faster and faster</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.720" end="00:18:10.530" style="s2">with more and more consequence this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.250" end="00:18:11.970" style="s2">this is a big deal right this way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.530" end="00:18:13.030" style="s2">talking about a transition not just an</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.030" end="00:18:19.160" style="s2">and so when we think about exponential</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.790" end="00:18:21.170" style="s2">curves in the ability to affect things</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.160" end="00:18:22.760" style="s2">where our tools give us more ability to</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.270" end="00:19:01.760" style="s2">said famously it&#39;s painfully evident</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.900" end="00:19:04.340" style="s2">that our technology is far surpassed our</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.760" end="00:19:05.720" style="s2">humanity we have to fix that issue right</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.660" end="00:19:16.330" style="s2">like the coming of the end of an age and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.240" end="00:19:19.520" style="s2">the possible emergence of a new age</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.330" end="00:19:21.890" style="s2">there it&#39;s reasonable right to think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.520" end="00:19:23.330" style="s2">those metaphors and so if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.890" end="00:19:24.770" style="s2">it in the mythic sense as people is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.330" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">we&#39;re scaling towards having the power</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.330" end="00:19:37.670" style="s2">right so we have to move from</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.440" end="00:19:47.330" style="s2">problem solving having to change we also</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.930" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">have to move from thinking that we can</p>

<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.000" style="s2">of or at the expense of others as a</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.000" end="00:19:58.250" style="s2">change and so where there were local</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.880" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">that scenario we have these radically</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.250" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">interconnected global issues where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">oceans dying is that everybody issue and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:13.160" style="s2">anyone contributing right any nation</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:16.190" style="s2">contributing to those dynamics ends up</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:18.440" style="s2">affecting all of us so you know Nations</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.190" end="00:20:20.870" style="s2">made sense when the level at which we</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.440" end="00:20:22.220" style="s2">affected things was a kind of a national</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.870" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">level and we could govern at the level</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.220" end="00:20:25.310" style="s2">that we affect things but where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.740" style="s2">affecting things at a global level</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.310" end="00:20:30.590" style="s2">we have to really govern and think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.740" end="00:20:32.300" style="s2">that at that space right so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.590" end="00:20:34.220" style="s2">that there can be collapsed somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.300" end="00:20:35.540" style="s2">and we&#39;re unaffected by it and we get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.220" end="00:20:39.500" style="s2">make it through that&#39;s also an obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.540" end="00:20:40.520" style="s2">idea and on a very short timescale if</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.500" end="00:20:42.290" style="s2">you look at the different groups that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.520" end="00:20:43.670" style="s2">are looking at catastrophic risk an</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.290" end="00:20:45.800" style="s2">existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.670" end="00:20:47.480" style="s2">there&#39;s variance and what the timescales</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.800" end="00:20:49.010" style="s2">are but they&#39;re all profoundly shorter</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.480" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">than most of us think about on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.010" end="00:20:56.540" style="s2">basis how many people here feel that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:21:01.310" style="s2">right feel the sense of imminent shift</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.540" end="00:21:02.660" style="s2">right so when you have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.310" end="00:21:04.700" style="s2">where some things are getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.660" end="00:21:05.870" style="s2">exponentially better more powerful other</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:07.370" style="s2">things are getting exponentially worse</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.870" end="00:21:08.660" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t mean the system is going</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.370" end="00:21:10.070" style="s2">in either those directions it means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.660" end="00:21:11.780" style="s2">destabilizing and you&#39;re getting to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.070" end="00:21:13.850" style="s2">end of that phase you&#39;re either gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.780" end="00:21:15.530" style="s2">get a phase shift down to a much lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.850" end="00:21:17.210" style="s2">level of organization which looks like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:19.550" style="s2">things that none of us want or a phase</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.210" end="00:21:21.160" style="s2">shift up discreetly to a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.550" end="00:21:24.020" style="s2">different set of organizational and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.160" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">motivational and and even identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.020" end="00:21:28.910" style="s2">worldview dynamics so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:46.040" style="s2">here to talk about and explore more</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.910" end="00:21:47.300" style="s2">tonight some design principles so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.040" end="00:21:50.090" style="s2">gonna pick up on a few of the themes</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:52.670" style="s2">that that have been raised by my good</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.090" end="00:21:54.980" style="s2">friends one of the themes that has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:57.830" style="s2">raised as the notion of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.980" end="00:21:59.540" style="s2">in a way of thinking of things we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.830" end="00:22:00.950" style="s2">actually say that these these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.540" end="00:22:04.070" style="s2">have relationships to one another that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.950" end="00:22:05.630" style="s2">these themes come together when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.070" end="00:22:07.070" style="s2">looking at complexity how do we deal</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.630" end="00:22:08.570" style="s2">with complexity what is the tools that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.070" end="00:22:10.250" style="s2">we use to deal with complexity well</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.570" end="00:22:13.070" style="s2">there&#39;s two other concepts that come to</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.250" end="00:22:15.830" style="s2">mind one of them is simplicity and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.070" end="00:22:17.210" style="s2">other is clarity these three concepts</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.830" end="00:22:18.680" style="s2">always occur together they don&#39;t ever</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.210" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">occur separately where there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.680" end="00:22:22.580" style="s2">something that is complex there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:25.310" style="s2">something else that is simple and there</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.580" end="00:22:26.600" style="s2">is also something else that is clear so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.310" end="00:22:29.350" style="s2">the idea isn&#39;t to try to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.600" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">complexity into some state of simplicity</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.350" end="00:22:34.430" style="s2">or to try to see it only through the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:36.710" style="s2">terms of something which is simple but</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.430" end="00:22:38.690" style="s2">to actually use the tool of clarity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.710" end="00:22:38.820" style="s2">be able to deal with complexity so and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.690" end="00:22:39.899" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.820" end="00:22:41.820" style="s2">fact what I&#39;m gonna try to do is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.899" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">gonna try to be really clear about some</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.820" end="00:22:46.440" style="s2">of the ideas that that have come forward</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:48.509" style="s2">that we have about what sort of toolkit</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.440" end="00:22:51.480" style="s2">can we bring to bear on the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.509" end="00:22:53.279" style="s2">problems that are facing us we know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.480" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">the solutions that have been brought</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.279" end="00:22:57.809" style="s2">forward to create the civilization that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:22:59.970" style="s2">we&#39;re now in are no longer adequate for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.809" end="00:23:02.250" style="s2">dealing with the problem and when we try</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.970" end="00:23:05.100" style="s2">to even identify what the problem is we</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.250" end="00:23:07.529" style="s2">recognize that like life itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.100" end="00:23:10.049" style="s2">very complex so the effort is</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.529" end="00:23:12.179" style="s2">essentially to try to bring a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.049" end="00:23:14.669" style="s2">clarity to the process what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.179" end="00:23:17.220" style="s2">essence of what is going on how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.669" end="00:23:19.470" style="s2">how do we understand it how do we relate</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.220" end="00:23:22.019" style="s2">to it what ways can we influence or be</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.470" end="00:23:23.399" style="s2">influenced by it and so when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.019" end="00:23:25.350" style="s2">looking at design when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.399" end="00:23:27.419" style="s2">think about okay we&#39;re in a position of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.350" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">having these conversations about choices</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.419" end="00:23:31.110" style="s2">about the choices we make individually</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:33.269" style="s2">about the choices we make collectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.110" end="00:23:34.980" style="s2">as a community as a choices we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.269" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">collectively as a nation or as a globe</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.980" end="00:23:40.529" style="s2">and so in effect a lot of the exercise</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:43.309" style="s2">comes down to what are the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.529" end="00:23:46.679" style="s2">effective choice how do we choose</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.309" end="00:23:48.179" style="s2">together how do we align ourselves so</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.679" end="00:23:50.250" style="s2">that the choices that we&#39;re making are</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.179" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">good choices and what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.250" end="00:23:54.570" style="s2">make a good choice how would we know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:56.279" style="s2">how would we recognize it how would we</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.570" end="00:23:57.990" style="s2">understand whether the design that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.279" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">proposing to solve a particular problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.990" end="00:24:02.129" style="s2">is actually a good design it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:05.190" style="s2">that would create a solution that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.129" end="00:24:06.509" style="s2">enduring that is anti fragile that would</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.190" end="00:24:09.590" style="s2">in effect create a state of health</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.509" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">create a state of thriving we want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.590" end="00:24:14.820" style="s2">use whatever choices we make</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:16.049" style="s2">individually to try to move the society</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.820" end="00:24:18.029" style="s2">that we&#39;re in the culture that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.049" end="00:24:21.090" style="s2">into a phase transition that is in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.029" end="00:24:23.009" style="s2">sense a healthier way of being and to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.090" end="00:24:25.110" style="s2">that we would want to of course have</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.009" end="00:24:27.299" style="s2">some idea of what health is so that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.110" end="00:24:29.340" style="s2">can recognize it we would want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.299" end="00:24:31.559" style="s2">appreciate the kinds of dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.340" end="00:24:33.419" style="s2">create systems that that actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.559" end="00:24:35.129" style="s2">sense of vitality to them that we would</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.419" end="00:24:36.779" style="s2">want to be a part of because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.129" end="00:24:39.149" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s good for our own</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.779" end="00:24:42.360" style="s2">lives for our family for the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.149" end="00:24:45.389" style="s2">life that we know we want to increase</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.360" end="00:24:46.649" style="s2">that but to know how to do that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.389" end="00:24:51.280" style="s2">that&#39;s balanced in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.649" end="00:24:53.620" style="s2">essentially Omni considerate well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.280" end="00:24:56.200" style="s2">complicated problem and in order for us</p>

<p begin="00:24:59.710" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">need to even think about the notion of</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:02.279" style="s2">have a conversation and I ask a few</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.700" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">questions I ask okay so you know do we</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.279" end="00:28:06.809" style="s2">have the materials can we can we source</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.809" end="00:28:10.440" style="s2">we build the tools that that that are</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.590" end="00:28:18.510" style="s2">make the product can we afford to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.149" end="00:28:20.220" style="s2">you know can we pay people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.510" end="00:28:21.990" style="s2">has anybody thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.220" end="00:28:23.580" style="s2">instructions that are that are necessary</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.580" end="00:28:27.779" style="s2">use this thing is there an idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.460" end="00:28:29.490" style="s2">you&#39;re going to present it to the market</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.779" end="00:28:33.059" style="s2">do you know who the beneficiary of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.490" end="00:28:34.590" style="s2">work is do you understand all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.059" end="00:28:36.059" style="s2">kinds of relationships that are going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.590" end="00:28:38.130" style="s2">evolve in the marketplace and how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.059" end="00:28:39.960" style="s2">going to change the market have you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.130" end="00:28:41.669" style="s2">accounted for what happens with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.960" end="00:28:42.990" style="s2">product after a person&#39;s done using it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.669" end="00:28:44.789" style="s2">where does it eventually go in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.990" end="00:28:46.230" style="s2">environment does it come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.789" end="00:28:47.820" style="s2">manufacturer and you recycle it somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.230" end="00:28:49.830" style="s2">or another does it end up in a landfill</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.820" end="00:28:51.299" style="s2">you know when we look at things like</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.830" end="00:28:53.340" style="s2">pollution there&#39;s a sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.299" end="00:28:54.779" style="s2">realization that pollution happens the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.340" end="00:28:57.059" style="s2">instant that something is made it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.779" end="00:28:58.980" style="s2">you know sometime later on when it ends</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.059" end="00:29:00.419" style="s2">up in the landfill as soon as we combine</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.980" end="00:29:03.090" style="s2">something that nature has no way of</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.090" end="00:29:08.490" style="s2">part of the problem so in effect we need</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:11.580" style="s2">to think about a much broader set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.490" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">questions a much broader set of of ideas</p>

<p begin="00:29:14.970" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">in order for us to essentially identify</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.820" end="00:29:28.680" style="s2">even asking the right questions and how</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.650" end="00:29:30.870" style="s2">would we know so in a lot of ways the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.680" end="00:29:32.340" style="s2">the details that we&#39;re trying to get to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.870" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">the things that that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.340" end="00:29:38.250" style="s2">really important how do we organize</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.430" end="00:29:58.140" style="s2">ways it comes down to a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.560" end="00:30:14.370" style="s2">culture has gotten very enamored with</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.330" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">this so-called broadcast process Here I</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.220" end="00:30:38.850" style="s2">essentially a top-down way of thinking</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:44.790" style="s2">process you know we have a problem we</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:46.290" style="s2">want to solve we figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.790" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">solve that particular problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.290" end="00:30:49.800" style="s2">we work out all the details and then we</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:53.160" style="s2">you know we deliver right sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.800" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">waterfall lifecycle design what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.160" end="00:30:57.410" style="s2">really need in this particular point is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:31:00.420" style="s2">a kind of design a kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.410" end="00:31:04.380" style="s2">there rather than being from some sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.420" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">of central single monolithic point of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.380" end="00:31:11.250" style="s2">view has in a sense a kind of diffused</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:14.670" style="s2">integration that has a kind of organic</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.250" end="00:31:16.620" style="s2">quality to it we don&#39;t have the time to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.670" end="00:31:18.210" style="s2">wait for evolution to figure this out</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.620" end="00:31:19.350" style="s2">and given some of the powers and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.210" end="00:31:21.870" style="s2">capacities that we have developed</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.350" end="00:31:24.090" style="s2">technologically we uneffective have</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.870" end="00:31:26.550" style="s2">entered into the responsibility of being</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.090" end="00:31:28.789" style="s2">responsible for our own evolution being</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.550" end="00:31:31.860" style="s2">responsible for our own design</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.789" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">so thinking about design questions in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.860" end="00:31:40.259" style="s2">way that&#39;s neither top-down which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:42.870" style="s2">maybe accurate but not precise enough or</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.259" end="00:31:45.870" style="s2">bottom-up which may be really really</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.870" end="00:31:47.190" style="s2">precise but takes a long time we find</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.870" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">ourselves in a situation where we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.190" end="00:31:52.710" style="s2">to come up with design capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">design characteristics that have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.710" end="00:31:59.159" style="s2">rapidity of top-down but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:32:01.409" style="s2">effectiveness of bottom-up and so in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.159" end="00:32:03.330" style="s2">sense our exercise is essentially to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.409" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">develop a set of tools to develop a set</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.330" end="00:32:08.009" style="s2">of conversations to set the set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:11.159" style="s2">intelligence building apparatus that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.009" end="00:32:15.870" style="s2">allows us to deal with complexity in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.159" end="00:32:29.639" style="s2">profoundly clear way so that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.870" end="00:32:30.899" style="s2">conversation is about tonight so before</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.639" end="00:32:33.809" style="s2">we get to the questions and answers I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.899" end="00:32:38.220" style="s2">just wanted to bring two more things one</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.809" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">is a strategic framework for how at</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.220" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">least I go about thinking about what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:45.210" style="s2">want to do and how I want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">in this thing because I have certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.210" end="00:32:47.970" style="s2">noticed over the past couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:50.070" style="s2">that different people have different</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:52.289" style="s2">proclivities their different preferences</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.070" end="00:32:53.580" style="s2">they have different kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.289" end="00:32:55.980" style="s2">they&#39;re attracted to and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.580" end="00:32:58.110" style="s2">not interested in at all and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.980" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">no one Pro try this every single person</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.110" end="00:33:01.799" style="s2">here is fully responsible for doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:04.740" style="s2">exactly what is theirs to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.799" end="00:33:09.090" style="s2">thing but it seems like there are three</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.740" end="00:33:11.370" style="s2">basic categories that things are pulling</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.090" end="00:33:13.320" style="s2">apart into and they&#39;re almost temporal</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.370" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">so the first category is is the category</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.320" end="00:33:18.120" style="s2">of the urgent there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:20.789" style="s2">urgent things that we must not let</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.120" end="00:33:22.500" style="s2">happen over the next couple of years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.789" end="00:33:23.730" style="s2">those aren&#39;t too hard to guess and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.500" end="00:33:25.860" style="s2">unfortunately we&#39;re getting off the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.730" end="00:33:27.659" style="s2">close to them things like say a nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.860" end="00:33:29.429" style="s2">war among the great powers would be the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.659" end="00:33:31.590" style="s2">sort of thing that we would must avoid</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.429" end="00:33:33.000" style="s2">over the next couple of years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.590" end="00:33:35.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a number actually of things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.000" end="00:33:38.010" style="s2">are absolutely urgent and must be</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.879" end="00:33:40.049" style="s2">avoided or in fact must it must happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.010" end="00:33:42.150" style="s2">over the next several years two three</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.049" end="00:33:43.890" style="s2">four years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.150" end="00:33:46.350" style="s2">if you&#39;re the kind of person who has the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.890" end="00:33:48.300" style="s2">energy and commitment and ability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.350" end="00:33:51.780" style="s2">sacrifice to address those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.300" end="00:33:53.400" style="s2">things that&#39;s a good place to go but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.780" end="00:33:55.530" style="s2">you are don&#39;t waste your time on things</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.400" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">that require 15 years of planning</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.530" end="00:34:00.420" style="s2">it&#39;s just a very those things are out of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">match the second category is a category</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.420" end="00:34:03.660" style="s2">or a lot of folks are spending time on</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:06.840" style="s2">right now and this is in the time frame</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.660" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">maybe anchored on say seven years or 15</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.840" end="00:34:10.440" style="s2">years somewhere in there depending on</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:12.419" style="s2">how things play out and I consider this</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.440" end="00:34:14.310" style="s2">to the period of transition and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.419" end="00:34:17.070" style="s2">the period where we do our absolute</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.310" end="00:34:18.840" style="s2">level best to squeeze a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.070" end="00:34:22.620" style="s2">years out of the current civilization</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.840" end="00:34:24.540" style="s2">model to hold us as we engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.620" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">transition so when we land it&#39;s a soft</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.540" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">landing and so something likes a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:30.060" style="s2">universal basic income which is was a</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">question that it was asked and is</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.060" end="00:34:34.290" style="s2">something that&#39;s getting more and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:36.840" style="s2">conscious now is in that category it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.290" end="00:34:39.210" style="s2">not post transition it&#39;s transitional if</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.840" end="00:34:41.419" style="s2">it works it will get us to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.210" end="00:34:44.130" style="s2">but it will not be the next step itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.419" end="00:34:46.110" style="s2">and then the third stage is that is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.130" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">stage that Forrest was talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.110" end="00:34:51.030" style="s2">post transitional stage and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:54.110" style="s2">extremely difficult this is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.030" end="00:34:56.460" style="s2">thing that to be resilient to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.110" end="00:34:59.130" style="s2">exponential technology is going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.460" end="00:35:01.560" style="s2">require a level of capability a level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.130" end="00:35:03.180" style="s2">precision a level of design that we we</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.560" end="00:35:05.880" style="s2">can barely name and we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.180" end="00:35:06.600" style="s2">fully figured out how to embody yet and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.880" end="00:35:07.890" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take years</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.600" end="00:35:09.600" style="s2">all right so heart in some sense if</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.890" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">you&#39;re in the first two categories your</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.600" end="00:35:14.670" style="s2">job is to buy time so the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.680" style="s2">prepared to try to do the stuff at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.670" end="00:35:18.240" style="s2">post transition framework can get those</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.680" end="00:35:20.370" style="s2">things in place so we&#39;re actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:22.920" style="s2">good thing to land on and if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.370" end="00:35:25.050" style="s2">visionary who can input put names</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.920" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">against those things to seek out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.050" end="00:35:28.830" style="s2">people who are who are equipped to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:31.230" style="s2">able to take that vision and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.830" end="00:35:33.840" style="s2">into reality and so that&#39;s one piece of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.230" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">material that I hope is helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.840" end="00:35:38.790" style="s2">people in thinking how to apply</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">themselves the other is the hopeful side</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.790" end="00:35:42.210" style="s2">of this conversation and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:44.210" style="s2">conversation with our friend Brett I</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.210" end="00:35:47.130" style="s2">think maybe yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.210" end="00:35:48.840" style="s2">about a dynamic that&#39;s going on a number</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.130" end="00:35:51.470" style="s2">of different places and this group is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.840" end="00:35:54.740" style="s2">certainly part of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.470" end="00:35:57.230" style="s2">when he will call the shamanic path and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.740" end="00:35:58.609" style="s2">he&#39;s an evolutionary theorist and he put</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.230" end="00:36:00.730" style="s2">it this way he said human beings</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.609" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">actually tend to operate in two modes</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.730" end="00:36:04.970" style="s2">when things are going well or actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:07.670" style="s2">if things are going even marginally okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.970" end="00:36:09.349" style="s2">we tend to just kind of like stay where</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.670" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">we are and run the code that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.349" end="00:36:13.250" style="s2">already written and we like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:15.710" style="s2">really safe because change is generally</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.250" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">a very bad thing but when things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.710" end="00:36:20.510" style="s2">clearly not doing well then we actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:23.060" style="s2">have to shift into a different mode and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.510" end="00:36:25.099" style="s2">we have to call up the shamanic energy</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.060" end="00:36:27.380" style="s2">you know people sitting around the fire</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.099" end="00:36:29.510" style="s2">and talking about things people dancing</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.380" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2">ecstatically people taking drugs to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.510" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">able to think differently because as</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:36.470" style="s2">individuals we really can&#39;t think we do</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:37.760" style="s2">not think as individuals we think as</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.470" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">groups we think as groups in</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.760" end="00:36:41.240" style="s2">conversation with each other as forrest</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.619" style="s2">is saying really learning the art of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.240" end="00:36:44.690" style="s2">coming together in groups they can have</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.619" end="00:36:47.359" style="s2">these conversations and rebirthing are</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.690" end="00:36:48.890" style="s2">actually calling out in ourselves the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.359" end="00:36:51.410" style="s2">shamanic energy to be able to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.890" end="00:36:53.440" style="s2">have the kind of consciousness necessary</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.410" end="00:36:56.450" style="s2">to do the things we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.440" end="00:36:59.390" style="s2">the thing the thing to be done and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.450" end="00:37:00.530" style="s2">good news is is that even though we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.390" end="00:37:01.670" style="s2">only grown up in a time frame where</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.530" end="00:37:06.349" style="s2">these sorts of things haven&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.670" end="00:37:09.319" style="s2">in our memory we are the the ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.349" end="00:37:11.329" style="s2">and the descendants of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.319" end="00:37:13.310" style="s2">had that time frame so it&#39;s in us to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.329" end="00:37:14.780" style="s2">it and I imagine most people here are</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.310" end="00:37:16.579" style="s2">actually feeling it and have faults for</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.780" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">quite some time all the way down at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.579" end="00:37:18.980" style="s2">cellular level</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:21.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s tuning into that and figuring</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.980" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">how to recover that thing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.560" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">also a big piece of the solution</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:38.690" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ve got some questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.299" end="00:37:41.089" style="s2">that have come in both online prior to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.690" end="00:37:44.210" style="s2">this event as well as all of you I hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.089" end="00:37:46.609" style="s2">have been writing questions as as these</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.210" end="00:37:48.829" style="s2">gentlemen have been sharing and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.609" end="00:37:52.250" style="s2">gonna pass around a box in about five</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.829" end="00:37:54.680" style="s2">minutes to collect your questions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.250" end="00:37:57.230" style="s2">then they&#39;re going to be ordered and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.680" end="00:37:59.539" style="s2">prioritized as best as possible and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.230" end="00:38:01.099" style="s2">shared so please if you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.539" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">if you have a burning question that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.099" end="00:38:05.900" style="s2">would think would be relevant to a large</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:07.900" style="s2">audience please jot it down and the box</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.900" end="00:38:11.119" style="s2">will go around in about five minutes in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.900" end="00:38:14.779" style="s2">the meantime we&#39;ve got some great ones</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.119" end="00:38:17.559" style="s2">that have come in online and let&#39;s start</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.779" end="00:38:17.559" style="s2">right here</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.859" end="00:38:26.599" style="s2">so there it is how can I most</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.150" end="00:38:33.079" style="s2">effectively evaluate and calibrate my</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.599" end="00:38:35.569" style="s2">own truth detection process how can I as</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.079" end="00:38:38.750" style="s2">objectively as possible find out if a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.569" end="00:38:41.480" style="s2">problem is real or probably real versus</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.750" end="00:38:45.970" style="s2">an overreaction or a misperception about</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.480" end="00:38:45.970" style="s2">collective reality or reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.630" end="00:38:56.539" style="s2">first if you have found yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:58.220" style="s2">responding to the environment let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.539" end="00:38:59.690" style="s2">for example you&#39;re among the very large</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.220" end="00:39:02.359" style="s2">number of people who responded to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.690" end="00:39:07.039" style="s2">2016 election with some mixture of anger</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.359" end="00:39:08.869" style="s2">or fear stop those emotions are very</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.039" end="00:39:12.470" style="s2">effective at driving action they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.869" end="00:39:13.490" style="s2">extremely poor at finding truth so relax</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.470" end="00:39:16.730" style="s2">slow down</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.490" end="00:39:19.190" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying slow down in the face</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.730" end="00:39:20.750" style="s2">of danger because there is danger but as</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.190" end="00:39:22.160" style="s2">our friends in the Marines say slow is</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.750" end="00:39:24.710" style="s2">smooth and smooth is fast</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.160" end="00:39:28.519" style="s2">becomes smooth so first if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.710" end="00:39:30.829" style="s2">smooth become smooth nothing else can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.519" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">good until you are smooth this is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.829" end="00:39:35.829" style="s2">important right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:38.119" style="s2">second Forrest mentioned an unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.829" end="00:39:40.309" style="s2">model that we found ourselves trained</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.119" end="00:39:42.410" style="s2">into largely from birth if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.309" end="00:39:44.420" style="s2">watching television certainly since you</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.410" end="00:39:47.270" style="s2">got to went to school which is too</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.420" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">get into a mode of broadcast of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.270" end="00:39:52.130" style="s2">the recipient of information that comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:39:54.080" style="s2">from people who you&#39;ve never met and is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.130" end="00:39:57.620" style="s2">broadcast out to a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.080" end="00:39:59.390" style="s2">people that is broadly untrustworthy no</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.620" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">matter what the origin source is if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.390" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">is broadcast it is broadly untrustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:05.090" style="s2">which means that you can listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:06.650" style="s2">but you&#39;re gonna have to do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.090" end="00:40:10.810" style="s2">work to make any sense out of it at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.650" end="00:40:13.600" style="s2">I spent about the last year now</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.810" end="00:40:16.490" style="s2">receiving information from hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.600" end="00:40:17.690" style="s2">descriptors that I painstakingly curate</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.490" end="00:40:20.840" style="s2">to make sure they are completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.690" end="00:40:21.950" style="s2">separate from each other and honestly I</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.840" end="00:40:24.140" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.950" end="00:40:25.730" style="s2">right now very well so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.140" end="00:40:27.950" style="s2">unlikely if you&#39;re getting news from</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.730" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">three or four sources that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.950" end="00:40:31.250" style="s2">to be able to actually use that to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:32.570" style="s2">sense of what you in particular should</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.250" end="00:40:33.860" style="s2">be doing right</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.570" end="00:40:35.630" style="s2">I mean you may be able to get really</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.860" end="00:40:38.180" style="s2">angry about something&#39;s going on nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.630" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">near you but that doesn&#39;t help you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.180" end="00:40:44.360" style="s2">so the key is in fact this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:45.560" style="s2">Forrest was talking about this the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.360" end="00:40:47.630" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do this is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.560" end="00:40:50.450" style="s2">have to begin engaging in conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.630" end="00:40:52.340" style="s2">with people we have to get in honestly</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.450" end="00:40:53.720" style="s2">we&#39;re in a situation where we we</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.340" end="00:40:54.920" style="s2">actually have the ability to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.720" end="00:40:55.340" style="s2">conversations with people all over the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.920" end="00:40:57.410" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.340" end="00:40:59.360" style="s2">and we can find them and talk with them</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.410" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">and share with them authentically and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.360" end="00:41:02.930" style="s2">listen to what it is that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:04.610" style="s2">actually trying to express regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.930" end="00:41:06.770" style="s2">what their words sound like to us and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.610" end="00:41:08.090" style="s2">relearn the art of actually creating</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.770" end="00:41:11.840" style="s2">these new forms of collective</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.090" end="00:41:13.610" style="s2">consciousness and that may sound</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.840" end="00:41:16.910" style="s2">superficial but it is absolutely the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.610" end="00:41:19.310" style="s2">opposite of superficial it is hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.910" end="00:41:23.270" style="s2">and people are crazy</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.310" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s nuts out there and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.270" end="00:41:28.570" style="s2">people also have crazy ideas like we use</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.000" end="00:41:31.640" style="s2">words to meet all kinds of weird things</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.570" end="00:41:34.070" style="s2">so it&#39;s beginning to build from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.640" end="00:41:35.210" style="s2">bottom up it is actually the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.070" end="00:41:37.010" style="s2">we&#39;re doing so it&#39;s not that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.210" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">trying to find the truth so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.010" end="00:41:42.290" style="s2">figure out the next thing to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">the thing we are doing and having the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.290" end="00:41:47.090" style="s2">ability to in yourself be able to listen</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:49.060" style="s2">to things that make you respond</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.090" end="00:41:52.040" style="s2">emotional or make no sense to your mind</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.060" end="00:41:54.260" style="s2">learn how to ask questions how to listen</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.040" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">to enter into dialogue how to seek out</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.260" end="00:41:57.890" style="s2">and find the people who have the thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:41:58.550" style="s2">that you need to share how to share what</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.890" end="00:42:00.140" style="s2">it is yours</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.550" end="00:42:01.880" style="s2">right now I mean that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.140" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">interesting challenge how do you not</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.880" end="00:42:05.180" style="s2">just run the response or persona tells</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.890" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">you gets people to do this you want</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.180" end="00:42:08.330" style="s2">them to do how do you actually share</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:11.030" style="s2">what is actually yours that you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.330" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">here to give that is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.030" end="00:42:15.530" style="s2">lesson to learn and so that notion by</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:22.010" style="s2">direction it being able to do that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.530" end="00:42:24.620" style="s2">is my answer that question picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.010" end="00:42:26.840" style="s2">what Jordan said best source of</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.620" end="00:42:27.890" style="s2">information is people you know in other</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.840" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">words rather than trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.890" end="00:42:30.830" style="s2">information from news sources of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.630" end="00:42:31.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know the filter</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.830" end="00:42:34.070" style="s2">that that information is coming through</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.970" end="00:42:35.330" style="s2">right anything that&#39;s a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.070" end="00:42:38.590" style="s2">communication anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.330" end="00:42:41.420" style="s2">essentially a one-to-many communication</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.590" end="00:42:43.970" style="s2">transit transaction and when I say many</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.420" end="00:42:45.710" style="s2">I mean like thousands or more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.970" end="00:42:47.990" style="s2">going to have essentially a conflict of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.710" end="00:42:50.240" style="s2">motivation that is essentially there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.990" end="00:42:52.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a commoditization of attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.240" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">and time your heart beats right that</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.870" end="00:42:56.360" style="s2">irreplaceable</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:59.090" style="s2">moments in your life which will never be</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.360" end="00:43:01.790" style="s2">repeated again okay so in effect what</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.090" end="00:43:03.290" style="s2">you what you what you first want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.790" end="00:43:05.810" style="s2">of keep in mind is is that we don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.290" end="00:43:07.400" style="s2">sense of anything by ourselves we make</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.810" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">sense of things in the community of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.400" end="00:43:11.420" style="s2">people that we know and trust and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:13.430" style="s2">effect you know by knowing the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.420" end="00:43:15.560" style="s2">that is in a sense has in their</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.430" end="00:43:17.480" style="s2">awareness that you&#39;re interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.560" end="00:43:18.770" style="s2">particular topic or that they they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.480" end="00:43:20.930" style="s2">a way of thinking about it that is very</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.770" end="00:43:23.510" style="s2">clear that they in a sense become a</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.510" end="00:43:28.730" style="s2">information actually means in context</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.140" end="00:43:30.680" style="s2">right to have someone be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.730" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">here&#39;s my perspective on it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.680" end="00:43:34.010" style="s2">the kind of perspectives that they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:37.010" style="s2">gives you a lot more information a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.010" end="00:43:38.900" style="s2">more sense making capacity than</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.010" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">receiving information from any anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.900" end="00:43:44.360" style="s2">source so the kinds of things that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:44.750" style="s2">naturally do we we hang out with our</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.360" end="00:43:47.150" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.750" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">and we have conversations I&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.150" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2">we do that a lot more and that we do it</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:55.160" style="s2">a lot more deliberately and that we do</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.850" end="00:43:56.600" style="s2">it with the kind of intention that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.160" end="00:44:00.920" style="s2">the specific intention of seeking</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.600" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">insight that we in effect are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.920" end="00:44:06.350" style="s2">see through the perspective of another</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:08.780" style="s2">individual so that we can combine it</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.350" end="00:44:11.000" style="s2">with our own perspective and have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.780" end="00:44:12.080" style="s2">greater depth a greater dimensionality</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:14.750" style="s2">of perception</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.080" end="00:44:17.870" style="s2">and what otherwise be possible right we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.750" end="00:44:19.760" style="s2">have to two of these organs we have two</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.870" end="00:44:21.560" style="s2">of these organs in fact we have this</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.760" end="00:44:23.900" style="s2">capacity to take the information that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.560" end="00:44:26.210" style="s2">see in each of these eyes and synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.900" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">it together to perceive three dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.210" end="00:44:32.180" style="s2">where any single organ by itself would</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:33.500" style="s2">only see two and this is a technology</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.180" end="00:44:35.240" style="s2">this is actually a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.500" end="00:44:36.830" style="s2">technology if I wanted to build a radio</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.240" end="00:44:39.590" style="s2">telescope that was bigger than the size</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.830" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2">of the planet I take the signal that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.590" end="00:44:44.060" style="s2">received at you know the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:45.350" style="s2">summer and then I wait six months and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.060" end="00:44:46.700" style="s2">take the signal that is received in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.350" end="00:44:49.670" style="s2">middle of winter and I combine them in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.700" end="00:44:51.710" style="s2">certain way and I get the effect as if I</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.670" end="00:44:55.190" style="s2">had built something that was the size of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.710" end="00:44:57.110" style="s2">the orbit of the earth as an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.190" end="00:44:59.570" style="s2">amazing result it&#39;s like this this</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.110" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">enormous multiplicative effect when we</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.570" end="00:45:05.570" style="s2">seek out diverse opinions diverse people</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:07.130" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to just talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.570" end="00:45:10.280" style="s2">that you know but you also want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.130" end="00:45:12.920" style="s2">to people that are interesting then in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.280" end="00:45:15.590" style="s2">sense you have a kind of intuition that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.920" end="00:45:17.270" style="s2">something they say may combine in an</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.590" end="00:45:19.070" style="s2">interesting way was something that did</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.270" end="00:45:20.690" style="s2">you would say to them and that through</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.070" end="00:45:23.930" style="s2">that sharing through that mutual</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.690" end="00:45:25.670" style="s2">experience that you will each perceive</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.930" end="00:45:29.270" style="s2">the world in a way that is more genuine</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.670" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">more depth and that&#39;s what we mean to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.270" end="00:45:33.890" style="s2">make sense of something to in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:39.410" style="s2">get to the point where we see into it to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.890" end="00:45:41.690" style="s2">have insight is to see into so put your</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.410" end="00:45:44.450" style="s2">cell phones away get together for dinner</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.690" end="00:45:45.650" style="s2">and talk about some real right I</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.450" end="00:45:47.600" style="s2">mean that&#39;s basically what it boils down</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.650" end="00:45:49.310" style="s2">to and remember what you remember what</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.600" end="00:45:51.110" style="s2">insights you have write it down you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.310" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">put it put it in some sort of notebook</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.110" end="00:45:53.870" style="s2">or something and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:55.730" style="s2">conversation the next dinner party that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.870" end="00:45:56.930" style="s2">you have bring out the best of the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.730" end="00:45:58.910" style="s2">of what you have in a sense come to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.930" end="00:46:01.310" style="s2">insights for and synthesize that to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.910" end="00:46:03.860" style="s2">deeper level the more you go through</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.310" end="00:46:05.480" style="s2">this process the easier it is and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.860" end="00:46:07.340" style="s2">more insights that you gain the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.480" end="00:46:08.960" style="s2">insights that we have into the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.340" end="00:46:15.620" style="s2">designs and the solutions that will</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.960" end="00:46:16.790" style="s2">constitute Civilization 2.0 add to what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.620" end="00:46:19.240" style="s2">these guys said because this might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.790" end="00:46:23.380" style="s2">the most important question of the night</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.240" end="00:46:23.380" style="s2">just to underscore the importance</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.910" end="00:46:31.120" style="s2">do we know what&#39;s happening at Fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.710" end="00:46:33.780" style="s2">really or how long we have for coral</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.120" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">reefs before we have to do what right</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.780" end="00:46:37.990" style="s2">how do we navigate how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:39.730" style="s2">collective choice making when we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.990" end="00:46:43.360" style="s2">have collective sense making how do we</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.730" end="00:46:44.890" style="s2">prioritize it like this is Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.360" end="00:46:48.630" style="s2">written extensively about this this is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.890" end="00:46:50.770" style="s2">core existential civilization issue and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.630" end="00:46:53.110" style="s2">individually we take in information we</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.770" end="00:46:54.610" style="s2">process it and we act on it but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.110" end="00:46:55.930" style="s2">we&#39;re all inter affecting each other and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.610" end="00:46:57.550" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with macro phenomena we</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.930" end="00:46:59.860" style="s2">have to be collectively taking in</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.550" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">information right treating each other as</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.860" end="00:47:04.270" style="s2">sensors and collectively processing it</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:08.470" style="s2">and being able to collectively act on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.270" end="00:47:11.350" style="s2">it is by definition the case that all</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.470" end="00:47:13.450" style="s2">perspectives on reality are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.350" end="00:47:15.160" style="s2">a reduction of reality they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.450" end="00:47:17.410" style="s2">have blind spots that are unavoidable</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.160" end="00:47:20.710" style="s2">the only way you start to address them</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.410" end="00:47:22.180" style="s2">is having more perspectives and then the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.710" end="00:47:25.330" style="s2">ability to start to integrate and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.180" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">synthesize those of course was saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.330" end="00:47:27.820" style="s2">get together and talk to people and both</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">of them were saying get together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.820" end="00:47:32.320" style="s2">talk to people that one of the keys was</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:36.040" style="s2">people who have different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.320" end="00:47:39.790" style="s2">and different data different Intel</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.040" end="00:47:42.600" style="s2">because you know how many people were</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.790" end="00:47:44.800" style="s2">really surprised by the Trump election</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.600" end="00:47:47.400" style="s2">who were talking to people about</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.800" end="00:47:49.650" style="s2">politics that all were in the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.400" end="00:47:52.840" style="s2">misinformation bubble that they were in</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.650" end="00:47:54.790" style="s2">right and because they stayed within a</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.840" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">worldview protected in group</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.790" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">misinformation bubble the world they</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.490" style="s2">thought existed in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:05.530" style="s2">actually existed were really radically</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.490" end="00:48:07.870" style="s2">different and so a couple things I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.530" end="00:48:09.640" style="s2">add is want to know what the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.870" end="00:48:13.480" style="s2">actually is rather than want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.640" end="00:48:17.170" style="s2">reinforce your ideas about it because if</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.480" end="00:48:21.400" style="s2">your ideas about it are off they will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.170" end="00:48:25.540" style="s2">maladaptive so want to get perspective</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.400" end="00:48:27.070" style="s2">that is different than and even</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.540" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">challenging to the current way that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.070" end="00:48:33.670" style="s2">see things critical one step deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:35.560" style="s2">that is separate your identity from your</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.670" end="00:48:39.160" style="s2">worldview</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.560" end="00:48:41.510" style="s2">right so that your sense of security</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.160" end="00:48:45.010" style="s2">emotionally and your sense of certainty</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.510" end="00:48:48.470" style="s2">about certain facts are decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.010" end="00:48:50.030" style="s2">because to the degree that your ability</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.470" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">to not freak out is because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.030" end="00:48:53.150" style="s2">fairly sure about something you will not</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">take alternate opinions on that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.150" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">alternate perspectives even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:49:01.190" style="s2">wrong and so the ability to have some</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:02.900" style="s2">sense of inability to not freak out that</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.190" end="00:49:04.760" style="s2">is decoupled from being fairly certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.900" end="00:49:12.860" style="s2">about things is actually really</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.760" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">important conversations that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.860" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">with these two gentlemen particularly is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:20.680" style="s2">that I know that when they say something</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:24.470" style="s2">that they&#39;ve thought about it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.680" end="00:49:26.570" style="s2">and so as a result I can I can put aside</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.470" end="00:49:28.520" style="s2">whatever beliefs I have and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.570" end="00:49:30.650" style="s2">reactions I might be experiencing or</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.520" end="00:49:32.960" style="s2">whatever my my ideas or thoughts or</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.650" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">opinions might be and say okay I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:36.620" style="s2">want to know what this person is</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:39.110" style="s2">thinking I want to understand how they</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.620" end="00:49:40.790" style="s2">are perceiving the world because</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.110" end="00:49:44.090" style="s2">whatever it is that they&#39;re saying it</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.790" end="00:49:46.760" style="s2">means something and and so in effect a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.090" end="00:49:48.980" style="s2">lot of the conversations are really</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.760" end="00:49:50.330" style="s2">based upon this idea that we believe</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.980" end="00:49:52.940" style="s2">that the other person is saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.330" end="00:49:57.320" style="s2">something that is meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.940" end="00:50:00.500" style="s2">important so in effect we want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.320" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">that aspect as the essence what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.500" end="00:50:04.850" style="s2">important ask that question what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:06.590" style="s2">important for you right now what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:54.619" style="s2">in order to do that we have to develop</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.970" end="00:51:21.529" style="s2">essence of this so that I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.710" end="00:51:25.700" style="s2">really as it is as it actually is not as</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.529" end="00:51:29.150" style="s2">I would have it be but as it in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.700" end="00:51:30.380" style="s2">needs to be responded to you know when</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.150" end="00:51:34.250" style="s2">things are going wrong the first</p>

<p begin="00:51:38.480" end="00:51:42.380" style="s2">and tell the truth this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.700" end="00:51:44.329" style="s2">what Jordan was talking about when he</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.380" end="00:51:48.470" style="s2">said first thing you want to do is slow</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.329" end="00:51:54.279" style="s2">down in order to get more insight and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.470" end="00:51:58.160" style="s2">more depth you want to slow down and</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.339" end="00:52:08.950" style="s2">actually telling you there are enormous</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.589" end="00:52:11.450" style="s2">number of tools that we have built-in</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.950" end="00:52:15.049" style="s2">for every blind spot there are a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.450" end="00:52:16.069" style="s2">of - winnings - things that are good and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.049" end="00:52:17.420" style="s2">for everything that&#39;s good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.069" end="00:52:20.180" style="s2">actually a couple of blind spots so we</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.420" end="00:52:21.529" style="s2">need to know how to navigate this the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.180" end="00:52:23.210" style="s2">way that we know that the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.529" end="00:52:27.380" style="s2">navigate through the minefield of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.210" end="00:52:29.420" style="s2">possible this is slow down you don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.380" end="00:52:32.990" style="s2">running through a minefield that tends</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.420" end="00:52:34.759" style="s2">to get you blown up so go slow so forest</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.990" end="00:52:37.069" style="s2">Daniel Jordan what I&#39;m hearing you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.759" end="00:52:39.380" style="s2">is one the importance of these sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.069" end="00:52:40.970" style="s2">making tools both as a collective as</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.380" end="00:52:44.269" style="s2">well as individuals and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.970" end="00:52:46.490" style="s2">how that as a process leads to empathy</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.269" end="00:52:49.059" style="s2">it leaves who more deeply understanding</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.490" end="00:52:52.609" style="s2">the other this next question is about</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.059" end="00:52:56.660" style="s2">building new models that make old models</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.609" end="00:52:58.299" style="s2">obsolete without creating absolute chaos</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.660" end="00:53:04.029" style="s2">is that possible</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.299" end="00:53:06.219" style="s2">so how I think I can take that one so</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.029" end="00:53:08.979" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at large system</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.219" end="00:53:11.259" style="s2">design you know like let&#39;s say you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.979" end="00:53:12.969" style="s2">a an operating system you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.259" end="00:53:14.259" style="s2">very complicated piece of software and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.969" end="00:53:15.429" style="s2">for some reason or other then you need</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.259" end="00:53:17.049" style="s2">to change it and you want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.429" end="00:53:19.089" style="s2">that you actually have a computer that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.049" end="00:53:21.160" style="s2">continues to work because you meet it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.089" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">you know to do things while these</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.160" end="00:53:26.170" style="s2">changes are going on it is possible to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.410" style="s2">do that it&#39;s a technique called</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.170" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">refactoring where you basically are</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.410" end="00:53:32.289" style="s2">partitioning the source code and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:33.219" style="s2">working with you know segments of it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.289" end="00:53:35.529" style="s2">you&#39;re keeping the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.219" end="00:53:38.589" style="s2">operational and rerouting signals across</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.529" end="00:53:41.829" style="s2">the path that you&#39;re trying to fix so it</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.589" end="00:53:45.219" style="s2">is possible to do this but it takes an</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.829" end="00:53:46.839" style="s2">awful lot of skill right if you are</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.219" end="00:53:48.249" style="s2">essentially trying to recreate an</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.839" end="00:53:49.779" style="s2">operating system of course the easy way</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.249" end="00:53:51.699" style="s2">to do is to trash the old one and start</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.779" end="00:53:53.829" style="s2">from scratch and create the new one but</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.699" end="00:53:55.269" style="s2">oftentimes this isn&#39;t actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.829" end="00:53:56.289" style="s2">good idea because what happens is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.269" end="00:53:57.999" style="s2">that it throws out the baby with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.289" end="00:53:59.799" style="s2">bathwater all of the problems that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.999" end="00:54:02.199" style="s2">old system actually effectively was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.799" end="00:54:04.479" style="s2">solution for I have to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.199" end="00:54:05.859" style="s2">again from scratch and half the time we</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.479" end="00:54:07.900" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what those problems are</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.859" end="00:54:09.489" style="s2">what those solutions actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.900" end="00:54:12.219" style="s2">what the techniques of solving those</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.489" end="00:54:13.660" style="s2">problems actually were so our new system</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.219" end="00:54:15.489" style="s2">may not actually be an improvement it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.660" end="00:54:17.229" style="s2">might solve this set of problems over</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.489" end="00:54:20.380" style="s2">here but all these things that used to</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.229" end="00:54:22.029" style="s2">work are broken so in effect when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.380" end="00:54:23.769" style="s2">looking at system design part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.029" end="00:54:25.329" style="s2">things that we want to do and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.769" end="00:54:27.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to morph a large</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.329" end="00:54:30.189" style="s2">complicated system is to first of all</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.640" end="00:54:32.109" style="s2">try to you know look at the picture of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.189" end="00:54:33.789" style="s2">what its functionality actually is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.109" end="00:54:37.539" style="s2">problems does it actually solve what are</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.789" end="00:54:39.729" style="s2">the assumptions that were made that may</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.539" end="00:54:40.869" style="s2">be different now or what are the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.729" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">assumptions that were made that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.869" end="00:54:45.549" style="s2">still true that we need to in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:47.259" style="s2">continue to uphold you have clarity</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.549" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">about those kinds of things then you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.259" end="00:54:50.890" style="s2">start replacing components one at a time</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.119" style="s2">or you could start basically going</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.890" end="00:54:54.009" style="s2">through the system and using the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.119" end="00:54:57.069" style="s2">components of the old one to build a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.009" end="00:54:58.779" style="s2">one having a clearer sense of what a</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.069" end="00:55:00.699" style="s2">successful architecture looks like means</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.779" end="00:55:03.549" style="s2">that to some extent you understood the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.699" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">old architecture and understood it well</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.549" end="00:55:08.019" style="s2">enough to understand what problems it</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:10.089" style="s2">was a solution for and what things it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.019" end="00:55:11.559" style="s2">was not a solution for so that when</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.089" end="00:55:12.040" style="s2">you&#39;re designing the new thing you&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:55:36.430" end="00:55:39.180" style="s2">well enough one force was describing how</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.110" end="00:55:42.850" style="s2">many things and I&#39;ve all simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.180" end="00:55:45.250" style="s2">optimizing for one of the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.850" end="00:55:48.490" style="s2">with the issues is that when we get</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.250" end="00:55:50.020" style="s2">scared and we want to go fast and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.490" end="00:55:51.970" style="s2">don&#39;t understand the problem space well</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.020" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">enough in addressing some of it we might</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.970" end="00:55:55.900" style="s2">be externalizing issues and even more</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.430" style="s2">problematic way and so we can see like</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.900" end="00:55:59.470" style="s2">getting scared about climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.430" end="00:56:02.110" style="s2">so we need we need to address</p>

<p begin="00:56:02.110" end="00:56:07.180" style="s2">is a big metric coral that&#39;s the first</p>

<p begin="00:56:34.500" end="00:56:41.110" style="s2">knowing what questions ask a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.410" end="00:56:42.790" style="s2">things on so the question was based off</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.110" end="00:56:44.410" style="s2">of the the Bucky fuller quote we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.790" end="00:56:45.940" style="s2">try and fight the existing system but</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.940" end="00:56:49.000" style="s2">more adequate meet the needs better that</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.000" end="00:56:53.410" style="s2">become then a strange attractor right</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.340" end="00:56:56.260" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re more selective</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.410" end="00:56:58.420" style="s2">so that&#39;s the topic of prototyping right</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.260" end="00:57:00.490" style="s2">civilization prototyping this is one of</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.800" end="00:57:09.790" style="s2">communities all the way up to city</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.630" end="00:57:11.320" style="s2">scales right and what would be the</p>

<p begin="00:58:08.450" end="00:58:14.930" style="s2">things being very bad the first has to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.870" end="00:58:16.520" style="s2">do with the way the elites relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.930" end="00:58:18.770" style="s2">transition so think about for example</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.520" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">the American Revolution the French</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.770" end="00:58:22.850" style="s2">Revolution and the collapse the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:25.160" style="s2">Empire in each of those characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.850" end="00:58:27.710" style="s2">the elites related to them transition</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.160" end="00:58:30.110" style="s2">very differently in the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.710" end="00:58:33.140" style="s2">Roman Empire the elites simply refused</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.110" end="00:58:35.090" style="s2">to allow a transition to occur until the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.140" end="00:58:37.310" style="s2">mismatch between their system and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.090" end="00:58:38.900" style="s2">complexity gotten so high that it did in</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.310" end="00:58:41.870" style="s2">fact go to what I would consider to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.900" end="00:58:44.210" style="s2">good representation of absolute chaos we</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.870" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">need to avoid that like the plague and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.210" end="00:58:48.440" style="s2">so finding ways to get some portion of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.060" end="00:58:50.390" style="s2">our elites to be able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.440" end="00:58:53.510" style="s2">consciousness of the necessity of being</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.390" end="00:58:56.510" style="s2">deliberate about change is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.510" end="00:58:58.400" style="s2">important but if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.510" end="00:59:00.470" style="s2">American Revolution at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:02.690" style="s2">United States along the coast in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.470" end="00:59:03.980" style="s2">colonies a pretty sizable function of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.690" end="00:59:06.260" style="s2">elites who we now know as the founding</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.980" end="00:59:07.490" style="s2">fathers were willing to step into and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.260" end="00:59:08.030" style="s2">take leadership in making that change</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.490" end="00:59:10.610" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.030" end="00:59:11.810" style="s2">now the other failure condition comes</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.610" end="00:59:13.640" style="s2">from the fact at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.810" end="00:59:16.370" style="s2">we&#39;re all monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.640" end="00:59:17.870" style="s2">we&#39;re primates right we&#39;ve gotten pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.370" end="00:59:19.550" style="s2">good at not killing each other in this</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.870" end="00:59:21.050" style="s2">room and staring and being quiet because</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.550" end="00:59:23.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve trained really hard at doing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.050" end="00:59:27.230" style="s2">but as civilization starts to break down</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.600" end="00:59:29.630" style="s2">we go right back to being Apes and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.230" end="00:59:32.270" style="s2">way that apes don&#39;t freak out is when</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.630" end="00:59:34.550" style="s2">some of the Apes seem to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.270" end="00:59:36.500" style="s2"> is going on and they don&#39;t freak</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.550" end="00:59:37.490" style="s2">out alright so when things go crazy</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.500" end="00:59:38.870" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna see people gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.490" end="00:59:40.910" style="s2">looking around if I write who</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.870" end="00:59:43.160" style="s2">to have their act together have your act</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.910" end="00:59:45.110" style="s2">together it&#39;s the emergent leaders is</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.160" end="00:59:47.330" style="s2">the second piece right the people who</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.110" end="00:59:50.840" style="s2">have done the work to be able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.330" end="00:59:52.940" style="s2">fast and not panic when things begin to</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.840" end="00:59:54.620" style="s2">break apart that other people will look</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.940" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">to and say where is the anchor what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.620" end="00:59:57.800" style="s2">going on here and if we have enough of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="01:00:00.410" style="s2">those people embedded in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.800" end="01:00:02.690" style="s2">happening even as things fall down they</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.410" end="01:00:04.010" style="s2">don&#39;t go to absolute chaos it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.690" end="01:00:06.500" style="s2">very interesting it&#39;s not an objective</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.010" end="01:00:08.450" style="s2">function we&#39;ve seen experiences where</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.500" end="01:00:10.010" style="s2">monetary systems have completely</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.450" end="01:00:12.590" style="s2">vaporized people have had a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.010" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">eating there&#39;s been fighting didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.590" end="01:00:17.690" style="s2">to absolute chaos because something held</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:19.160" style="s2">the fabric together right people certain</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.690" end="01:00:20.540" style="s2">emergent leaders are willing to step up</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.160" end="01:00:21.890" style="s2">and say no we&#39;re still gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.540" end="01:00:23.750" style="s2">civilized we&#39;re still gonna hold this</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.890" end="01:00:26.150" style="s2">thing together that&#39;s the other answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.750" end="01:00:27.290" style="s2">to it so the the architecture and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.150" end="01:00:29.090" style="s2">mechanics and the thinking in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.290" end="01:00:30.410" style="s2">process all very true but at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.090" end="01:00:31.430" style="s2">foundation if you want to keep these</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.410" end="01:00:35.890" style="s2">monkeys from tearing each other apart</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.430" end="01:00:38.540" style="s2">you know be the person you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.890" end="01:00:41.330" style="s2">completing up the next question awesome</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.540" end="01:00:43.720" style="s2">Jordan so so let&#39;s get into the how of</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.330" end="01:00:45.800" style="s2">that so this next question is how can we</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.720" end="01:00:48.740" style="s2">realign everyone&#39;s sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.800" end="01:00:50.420" style="s2">towards the well-being of all and away</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.740" end="01:00:52.130" style="s2">from the self-interest of the market</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.420" end="01:00:54.230" style="s2">economies so that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.130" end="01:00:57.410" style="s2">wholeheartedly cooperate and even</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.230" end="01:01:00.850" style="s2">innovate with such transitions how do we</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.410" end="01:01:00.850" style="s2">get there as humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.340" end="01:01:15.550" style="s2">the answer is necessarily iterative one</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.490" end="01:01:17.870" style="s2">of the things there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.550" end="01:01:20.630" style="s2">dialectic of different things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.870" end="01:01:23.810" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing in the group which is hey</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.630" end="01:01:25.430" style="s2">things are more eminently collapsing</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.810" end="01:01:26.390" style="s2">then you&#39;re aware of on a day-to-day</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.430" end="01:01:27.710" style="s2">basis when you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.390" end="01:01:29.690" style="s2">cleaning the house and paying the bills</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.710" end="01:01:31.910" style="s2">etc so there&#39;s an urgency in that at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.690" end="01:01:35.120" style="s2">same time we&#39;re hearing don&#39;t react too</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.910" end="01:01:37.640" style="s2">fast with urgency and slow down what</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.120" end="01:01:42.440" style="s2">that means is a shift of attention from</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.640" end="01:01:43.910" style="s2">other less critical stuff to the topics</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.440" end="01:01:46.880" style="s2">that are actually at hand because you</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.910" end="01:01:48.770" style="s2">get that they&#39;re real I know how many</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:51.110" style="s2">people have watched the videos of</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.770" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">Richard Fineman talking about space but</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.490" end="01:01:55.850" style="s2">he&#39;s like when you think about the vast</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.080" end="01:01:58.070" style="s2">distances of space and you think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.850" end="01:01:59.869" style="s2">the number of stars that we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.070" end="01:02:02.540" style="s2">like really think about and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.869" end="01:02:03.800" style="s2">there it&#39;s hard for us on planet to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.540" end="01:02:05.960" style="s2">think about four hundred billion stars</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.800" end="01:02:07.910" style="s2">in our galaxy it&#39;s not just hard it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.960" end="01:02:09.980" style="s2">actually impossible but to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.910" end="01:02:11.990" style="s2">that you try and then that&#39;s one tiny</p>

<p begin="01:02:11.990" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">being expands it&#39;s hard for us to think</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:28.340" style="s2">our personal choice consideration set</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.700" end="01:02:30.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard for us to get that the</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.020" end="01:02:33.050" style="s2">the people we&#39;ve respected have known is</p>

<p begin="01:02:41.390" end="01:02:46.730" style="s2">to think about it you can actually get</p>

<p begin="01:02:53.570" end="01:02:58.790" style="s2">a fairly simple math right you can start</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.020" end="01:02:59.840" style="s2">to educate about those things and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.790" end="01:03:01.790" style="s2">we don&#39;t know exactly what the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.840" end="01:03:03.560" style="s2">timeframes are but that this current</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.790" end="01:03:07.430" style="s2">civilization set is shifting and se-ra</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.560" end="01:03:08.690" style="s2">if I take that seriously if I really</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.430" end="01:03:12.050" style="s2">take that seriously what do I do</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.690" end="01:03:13.910" style="s2">differently well I&#39;m gonna allocate more</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.050" end="01:03:16.580" style="s2">time to getting more educated I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.910" end="01:03:18.140" style="s2">develop my thinking and sense making</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.580" end="01:03:19.850" style="s2">frameworks one of the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.140" end="01:03:22.070" style="s2">didn&#39;t speak to earlier while we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.850" end="01:03:23.690" style="s2">talking to people and when Forrest said</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.070" end="01:03:24.560" style="s2">he takes seriously when Jordan or I say</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.690" end="01:03:25.640" style="s2">something cuz we&#39;ve thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.560" end="01:03:27.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean he agrees with all of it</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.640" end="01:03:29.390" style="s2">right and it doesn&#39;t mean that he</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.560" end="01:03:31.609" style="s2">rejects all of it means he has an</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.390" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">ability to have analytic thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.609" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">really critical thinking and parse is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.170" style="s2">this true is that not true how do we</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:37.760" style="s2">know those are skills that are</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.170" end="01:03:40.340" style="s2">developable that everybody has to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.760" end="01:03:41.600" style="s2">develop and then synthetic thinking well</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.340" end="01:03:42.950" style="s2">that seems true and it seems quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.600" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">different than another truth how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.950" end="01:03:48.050" style="s2">those actually fit together right so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:49.430" style="s2">ability for analysis and synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.050" end="01:03:51.109" style="s2">there&#39;s more than that that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.430" end="01:03:52.790" style="s2">but developing those frameworks and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.109" end="01:03:54.859" style="s2">putting data into those frameworks and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.790" end="01:03:57.530" style="s2">putting more time into the entire thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.859" end="01:04:00.890" style="s2">but so how do we develop the care right</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.530" end="01:04:03.290" style="s2">if you really think about and get that</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.890" end="01:04:04.820" style="s2">your own success and the success of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.290" end="01:04:06.710" style="s2">family is not insurer</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.820" end="01:04:08.450" style="s2">independent of the success of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.710" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">if you get that that is true in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.450" end="01:04:14.150" style="s2">timeframe of your life in your</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:16.040" style="s2">children&#39;s life and in trying to ensure</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.150" end="01:04:18.650" style="s2">their success independent of the success</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.040" end="01:04:19.820" style="s2">of the whole it will fail yeah no can</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.650" end="01:04:24.350" style="s2">you say that once more it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.820" end="01:04:27.140" style="s2">important point that trying to ensure</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.350" end="01:04:29.480" style="s2">our own individual success independent</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.140" end="01:04:31.160" style="s2">of or even at the expense of the success</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.480" end="01:04:34.370" style="s2">of others of the whole is not a viable</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.160" end="01:04:36.110" style="s2">strategy and yet it was something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.370" end="01:04:38.330" style="s2">seemed viable for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.110" end="01:04:39.590" style="s2">so it&#39;s easy to kind of fall back on</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.330" end="01:04:41.930" style="s2">that intuition but to get that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.590" end="01:04:43.580" style="s2">fundamentally different time so so</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.930" end="01:04:47.260" style="s2">people can get that intellectually but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.580" end="01:04:47.260" style="s2">how do you get them to be that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.890" end="01:04:54.519" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna give time to think by throwing</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.440" end="01:04:57.309" style="s2">something out that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.519" end="01:05:03.339" style="s2">conversation I mean didn&#39;t I mention</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.309" end="01:05:04.599" style="s2">that this notion of win-lose was seemed</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.339" end="01:05:05.650" style="s2">like a viable strategy for a very long</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.599" end="01:05:09.010" style="s2">period of time I&#39;m actually gonna make a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.650" end="01:05:11.819" style="s2">stronger statement that for effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.010" end="01:05:15.819" style="s2">all of evolutionary history up until</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.819" end="01:05:18.339" style="s2">like a couple weeks ago it was by far</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.819" end="01:05:21.760" style="s2">the best strategy it was the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.339" end="01:05:23.109" style="s2">best strategy if you didn&#39;t do that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.760" end="01:05:24.730" style="s2">were going to be selected against and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.109" end="01:05:25.750" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s children are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.730" end="01:05:27.549" style="s2">the children who populated the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.750" end="01:05:30.339" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to keep that in</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.549" end="01:05:32.380" style="s2">mind like evolution really really really</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.339" end="01:05:36.789" style="s2">wants us to struggle with other things</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.380" end="01:05:38.980" style="s2">to survive but now we&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.789" end="01:05:40.809" style="s2">where things are changing so the the</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.980" end="01:05:41.950" style="s2">magnitude this changes not just in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.809" end="01:05:43.599" style="s2">sense that our civilization is</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.950" end="01:05:45.039" style="s2">collapsing alright the other side is</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.599" end="01:05:46.119" style="s2">well number Daniel mentioned that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.039" end="01:05:48.369" style="s2">reaching a point where there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.119" end="01:05:49.750" style="s2">be a pivot and it&#39;s not they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.369" end="01:05:51.010" style="s2">go up or down and if it goes down it</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.750" end="01:05:53.019" style="s2">goes way down if it goes up it goes way</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.010" end="01:05:55.809" style="s2">up and the people who talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.019" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">abundance aren&#39;t wrong we actually have</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.809" end="01:06:00.190" style="s2">created so much capacity that the kinds</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.859" style="s2">of things that we have been struggling</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.190" end="01:06:04.990" style="s2">over for hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.859" end="01:06:07.269" style="s2">are no longer meaningful and so for</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.990" end="01:06:08.200" style="s2">example you guys are I assume reasonably</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.269" end="01:06:10.660" style="s2">familiar with this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.200" end="01:06:11.950" style="s2">technological unemployment it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.660" end="01:06:13.900" style="s2">getting a lot of press in the Bay Area</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.950" end="01:06:16.329" style="s2">and places like that but things like</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.900" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">self-driving cars are gonna unemploy 1.5</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.329" end="01:06:19.480" style="s2">million people in the next decade and</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:21.609" style="s2">that robots are gonna take everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.480" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">jobs now if you&#39;re on the scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.609" end="01:06:26.140" style="s2">mindset that&#39;s very scary and being</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:28.539" style="s2">unemployed is very bad</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.140" end="01:06:29.529" style="s2">but if you flip it around what that</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.539" end="01:06:32.349" style="s2">means is that we don&#39;t actually need</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.529" end="01:06:35.289" style="s2">people to work that much anymore in fact</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.349" end="01:06:37.720" style="s2">in some sense in the next 20 years but</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.289" end="01:06:39.640" style="s2">do our things right nobody needs to work</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.720" end="01:06:40.839" style="s2">anymore and we actually have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.640" end="01:06:44.200" style="s2">out how to apply ourselves to something</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.839" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">completely different so we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.200" end="01:06:48.700" style="s2">process again of watching this old</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:49.809" style="s2">structure begin to fall apart and as</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.700" end="01:06:51.940" style="s2">Dana said it&#39;s going to be iterative</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.809" end="01:06:54.220" style="s2">right things like universal basic income</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.940" end="01:06:56.500" style="s2">or a nice transitionary piece and there</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.220" end="01:06:58.809" style="s2">will be other pieces as well that will</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.500" end="01:07:01.359" style="s2">begin to buffer the feeling of scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.809" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">in a way that begins to allow people to</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.359" end="01:07:04.100" style="s2">have actual</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:06.260" style="s2">real freedom to not to have to feel like</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.100" end="01:07:08.900" style="s2">they have to go out and fight you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.260" end="01:07:10.850" style="s2">dog and dog and meats dog inside the</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.900" end="01:07:13.250" style="s2">workplace to survive and then in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.850" end="01:07:14.630" style="s2">meantime we&#39;re in the process of trying</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.250" end="01:07:17.300" style="s2">to figure out how to build structures</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.630" end="01:07:19.190" style="s2">that are designed for abundance which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.300" end="01:07:20.450" style="s2">a very different thing I mean abundance</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.190" end="01:07:22.550" style="s2">is a completely different framework of</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.450" end="01:07:24.350" style="s2">how we go about doing things by the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.550" end="01:07:26.360" style="s2">it&#39;s non-trivial you know purpose for</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.350" end="01:07:27.920" style="s2">example is a big problem if you think</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.360" end="01:07:30.950" style="s2">about it right now we have this really</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.920" end="01:07:34.220" style="s2">night mat nice mesh where you work to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.950" end="01:07:36.500" style="s2">survive they glue together all right if</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.220" end="01:07:37.670" style="s2">I pull that apart and I make it okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.500" end="01:07:40.040" style="s2">well you don&#39;t have to work and you can</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.670" end="01:07:41.840" style="s2">still survive where&#39;s purpose fit into</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.040" end="01:07:43.640" style="s2">this most people get their sense of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.840" end="01:07:45.590" style="s2">purpose by being valuable to other</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.640" end="01:07:47.060" style="s2">people by doing their job and creating</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.590" end="01:07:48.050" style="s2">something in the world but if you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.060" end="01:07:49.760" style="s2">longer working and you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.050" end="01:07:50.990" style="s2">surviving that&#39;s actually terrible that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.760" end="01:07:52.970" style="s2">will destroy things if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.990" end="01:07:54.619" style="s2">some way of actually generating purpose</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.970" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">in different mechanism so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.619" end="01:07:58.940" style="s2">problems ining post-transition designing</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.830" style="s2">for abundance is a spiritual it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.940" end="01:08:03.140" style="s2">psychological it&#39;s an economic it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.830" end="01:08:05.240" style="s2">technological process it is another way</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.140" end="01:08:06.859" style="s2">of saying the new toolkit that were</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.240" end="01:08:16.790" style="s2">trying to build some out there was</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.859" end="01:08:18.890" style="s2">someone helpful so so Jordan used the</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.790" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">word whoa Jordan used the word purpose</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.890" end="01:08:23.630" style="s2">and I think it was an entirely</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:28.040" style="s2">appropriate choice there is these three</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.630" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">concepts purpose value and meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.040" end="01:08:33.140" style="s2">those again are three things that go</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.970" style="s2">together but are distinct right they are</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.140" end="01:08:36.740" style="s2">three concepts that we tend to conflate</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.970" end="01:08:39.190" style="s2">a lot when we talk about how do we</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.740" end="01:08:41.480" style="s2">create an economy we&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.190" end="01:08:43.069" style="s2">value systems we&#39;re thinking about money</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.480" end="01:08:44.630" style="s2">as a value system or you know an</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.069" end="01:08:46.759" style="s2">exchange medium of some sort or another</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.630" end="01:08:48.890" style="s2">right whereas when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.759" end="01:08:50.930" style="s2">you know jobs and and you know what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.890" end="01:08:52.279" style="s2">our function in life what do we do you</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.930" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">know you come to a party and you ask</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.279" end="01:08:56.390" style="s2">okay well what do you do what&#39;s your job</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:59.299" style="s2">and when we move into a situation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.390" end="01:09:00.920" style="s2">a post-scarcity economy we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.299" end="01:09:03.410" style="s2">an abundance economy of some sort or</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.920" end="01:09:04.970" style="s2">another the usual ways of thinking of</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.410" end="01:09:06.470" style="s2">defining our lives in terms of purpose</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.970" end="01:09:08.480" style="s2">or in terms of value just aren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.470" end="01:09:10.310" style="s2">to work because it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.480" end="01:09:14.160" style="s2">about that it&#39;s gonna be about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.310" end="01:09:18.300" style="s2">meaningfulness of life meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.160" end="01:09:20.190" style="s2">is deeper than value or purpose the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.300" end="01:09:22.430" style="s2">notions of value and purpose are</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.190" end="01:09:24.810" style="s2">relative to the notion of meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.430" end="01:09:26.490" style="s2">so if we&#39;re going to in a sense come to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.810" end="01:09:28.470" style="s2">you know some sort of alignment where</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.490" end="01:09:30.120" style="s2">we&#39;re basically saying okay how do we as</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.470" end="01:09:32.280" style="s2">individual people move beyond this</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.120" end="01:09:33.630" style="s2">economic actor model where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.280" end="01:09:35.910" style="s2">basically having some sort of exchange</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.630" end="01:09:37.590" style="s2">medium and that this exchange process is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.910" end="01:09:39.300" style="s2">how we create survival how we create</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.590" end="01:09:40.860" style="s2">some sort of you know thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.300" end="01:09:42.570" style="s2">essentially providing food and shelter</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.860" end="01:09:43.770" style="s2">and all the rest of that stuff if we</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.570" end="01:09:46.290" style="s2">come up with a way of using our</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.770" end="01:09:47.910" style="s2">technology that manages to provide food</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.290" end="01:09:52.380" style="s2">for every living person on this planet</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.910" end="01:09:53.880" style="s2">which we actually have or technology</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.380" end="01:09:56.180" style="s2">that allows us to provide shelter for</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.880" end="01:09:58.260" style="s2">everybody which we actually also have</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.180" end="01:10:00.420" style="s2">that really it becomes a question of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.260" end="01:10:03.080" style="s2">thinking about it differently right we</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.420" end="01:10:05.730" style="s2">in a sense incorporate a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.080" end="01:10:08.670" style="s2">non-economic foundation into creating</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.730" end="01:10:10.170" style="s2">choice alignment and how do we do that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.670" end="01:10:12.300" style="s2">well we don&#39;t do it by trying to have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.170" end="01:10:13.620" style="s2">purpose for everybody that we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.300" end="01:10:15.420" style="s2">thinking in terms of how much of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.620" end="01:10:17.130" style="s2">dollar value each person has you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.420" end="01:10:19.830" style="s2">how much does your net worth isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.130" end="01:10:21.000" style="s2">very meaningful conversation but on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.830" end="01:10:24.240" style="s2">other hand you&#39;re talking about life</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.000" end="01:10:27.510" style="s2">experiences or what&#39;s important to you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.240" end="01:10:28.980" style="s2">right now or what sort of insights that</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.510" end="01:10:30.870" style="s2">you&#39;ve had from an experience that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.980" end="01:10:33.870" style="s2">had last week those are the things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.870" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">create true connections and in effect if</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.870" end="01:10:38.040" style="s2">we&#39;re going to move into an economy of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:39.870" style="s2">essentially some sort of post scarcity</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.040" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">sort of situation it&#39;s going to be based</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.870" end="01:10:43.980" style="s2">on a meaningfulness principle rather</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:46.290" style="s2">than on a purpose principle or a value</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.980" end="01:10:48.810" style="s2">principle and this is a key concept this</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.290" end="01:10:53.270" style="s2">is something I believe to be a necessary</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.810" end="01:10:56.670" style="s2">aspect of how to think about this sue</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.270" end="01:10:58.380" style="s2">mentioned phases there&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.670" end="01:11:00.390" style="s2">that we&#39;re in and there&#39;s urgent stuff</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.380" end="01:11:02.040" style="s2">that allows us to keep figuring stuff</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.390" end="01:11:04.380" style="s2">out there&#39;s a transition there&#39;s a post</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.040" end="01:11:06.000" style="s2">transition the transition phase is</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.380" end="01:11:07.770" style="s2">fundamentally different than the phase</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:10.140" style="s2">that&#39;s transitioning from and to is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.770" end="01:11:13.710" style="s2">key insight will maybe get to that more</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.140" end="01:11:16.800" style="s2">later but to answer this question of how</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.710" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">do we increase the connectedness of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.800" end="01:11:23.450" style="s2">sense of self and the sense of reality</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:23.450" style="s2">and increase</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.100" end="01:11:30.530" style="s2">CAIR awareness etc how do we do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.160" end="01:11:32.960" style="s2">we said it was going to be iterative so</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.530" end="01:11:35.360" style="s2">one design criteria is that for the in</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.960" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">the post transition phase that actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.360" end="01:11:41.510" style="s2">has to be everybody and we mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:43.640" style="s2">antifragility in the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.510" end="01:11:45.710" style="s2">exponential technology we can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.640" end="01:11:48.350" style="s2">put exponential technology back in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.710" end="01:11:50.540" style="s2">bag that that&#39;s just an inexorable thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.350" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">that those capacities are there now when</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.540" end="01:11:56.060" style="s2">you think about someone who you know we</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:59.000" style="s2">see goes and does a mass shooting that</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.060" end="01:12:00.920" style="s2">seemed kind of unprovoked if they have</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.000" end="01:12:02.750" style="s2">the access to a gun and especially say</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.920" end="01:12:04.550" style="s2">an automatic gun they can do more damage</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.750" end="01:12:07.550" style="s2">in that process than if they have the</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.550" end="01:12:10.430" style="s2">access to just a knife right and so now</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.550" end="01:12:12.410" style="s2">as we take exponential technology where</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.430" end="01:12:14.510" style="s2">you think about the first really</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.410" end="01:12:16.100" style="s2">catastrophic technologies we had very</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.510" end="01:12:18.430" style="s2">few people could have access to like</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.100" end="01:12:24.860" style="s2">nuclear weapons as you move into</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.430" end="01:12:27.230" style="s2">decentralized exponential tech and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.860" end="01:12:30.020" style="s2">very small numbers of people can have</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.230" end="01:12:32.090" style="s2">really catastrophic actions the Omni</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.020" end="01:12:33.440" style="s2">consideration and choice making has to</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.090" end="01:12:34.970" style="s2">be universal not just some people</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.440" end="01:12:36.590" style="s2">because there&#39;s no longer ruling class</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.970" end="01:12:40.160" style="s2">that then has all the power and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.590" end="01:12:42.110" style="s2">else who doesn&#39;t and so that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.160" end="01:12:44.270" style="s2">the post transition design criteria and</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.110" end="01:12:47.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a really deep big deal criteria to</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.270" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">think about so for instance most the</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.390" end="01:12:50.870" style="s2">time that person who goes into the mass</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.130" style="s2">shooting the neighbors say we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.870" end="01:12:53.180" style="s2">really know them right they were quiet</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.130" end="01:12:55.460" style="s2">they kept to themselves they were a</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.180" end="01:12:56.810" style="s2">shut-in and so they could be developing</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.460" end="01:12:59.300" style="s2">in their loneliness in their</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.810" end="01:13:01.970" style="s2">psychopathology with nobody noticing it</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.300" end="01:13:04.010" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t work right in the future so</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.970" end="01:13:06.310" style="s2">how do we move to connected enough</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.010" end="01:13:08.690" style="s2">civilizations that everyone is is</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.310" end="01:13:09.980" style="s2">actually connected to other humans</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.690" end="01:13:11.420" style="s2">meaningfully that others are connected</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.980" end="01:13:15.770" style="s2">to them those are going to be key design</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.420" end="01:13:17.510" style="s2">criteria but while we say everyone</p>

<p begin="01:14:35.860" end="01:14:41.050" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do for this final round</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.300" end="01:14:42.550" style="s2">I want all I want you to really tune in</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.050" end="01:14:45.640" style="s2">if this is your question and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.550" end="01:14:47.230" style="s2">your question jump on it and and answer</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.640" end="01:14:48.730" style="s2">it as concisely as you can and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.230" end="01:14:50.370" style="s2">move on to the next once we get through</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.730" end="01:14:52.620" style="s2">through some really good content here so</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.370" end="01:14:55.360" style="s2">this first one&#39;s a bit of a challenge</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.620" end="01:14:59.140" style="s2">this first one is a challenge to guide</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.360" end="01:15:02.680" style="s2">us through a visualization on how the</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.140" end="01:15:05.320" style="s2">perfect storm unfolds to guide us</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.680" end="01:15:07.150" style="s2">through this transition in the best case</p>

<p begin="01:15:09.490" end="01:15:17.080" style="s2">and particularly help us visualize the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.180" end="01:15:23.020" style="s2">best case scenario steps that unfold to</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.080" end="01:15:25.530" style="s2">get us there no pressure you want this</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.020" end="01:15:25.530" style="s2">to be fast</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.500" end="01:15:32.890" style="s2">go for it Jordan it&#39;s made that we need</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.790" end="01:15:34.570" style="s2">in an order of magnitude between five</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.890" end="01:15:37.150" style="s2">and ten as significant as the trim</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.570" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">pocalypse to have enough of an impact on</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.150" end="01:15:41.410" style="s2">people&#39;s consciousness to cause enough</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:43.810" style="s2">people to detach from their existing</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.410" end="01:15:45.460" style="s2">dependence on legacy systems and be</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.810" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">willing to take the risk to jump into</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.460" end="01:15:50.950" style="s2">novelty space but if it&#39;s more than 10</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:51.430" style="s2">or 20 times as large as the Trump</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.950" end="01:15:53.260" style="s2">pocalypse</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.430" end="01:15:55.020" style="s2">that begins to create negative cascade</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.260" end="01:15:57.070" style="s2">effects so look at something like</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.020" end="01:15:58.750" style="s2">ideally we would have some kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.070" end="01:16:01.330" style="s2">significant economic collapse that would</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.750" end="01:16:02.860" style="s2">be best-case scenario like if we could</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.330" end="01:16:04.300" style="s2">imagine having hyperinflation where all</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.860" end="01:16:06.220" style="s2">dollars are worth nothing tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.300" end="01:16:08.890" style="s2">that&#39;d be a godsend that would actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.220" end="01:16:10.240" style="s2">move almost everybody in - oh this thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.890" end="01:16:12.160" style="s2">that sucks anyway it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.240" end="01:16:14.230" style="s2">anymore let me be an experimenting on</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.160" end="01:16:17.200" style="s2">the ground without things blowing up</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.230" end="01:16:18.970" style="s2">right blowing up is bad imaginary stuff</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.200" end="01:16:22.540" style="s2">going away is good so that&#39;s a good good</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.970" end="01:16:26.260" style="s2">rule of thumb to degree to which you can</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.540" end="01:16:28.000" style="s2">get on the order of about 250,000 people</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.260" end="01:16:30.460" style="s2">beginning to interconnect with each</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.000" end="01:16:32.050" style="s2">other and also connect with at least 12</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.460" end="01:16:34.150" style="s2">people on an individualized basis so</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.050" end="01:16:37.270" style="s2">that&#39;s about three million people in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.150" end="01:16:38.710" style="s2">meshwork building the kinds of practices</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.270" end="01:16:40.480" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.710" end="01:16:42.490" style="s2">probably critical mass in the United</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.480" end="01:16:43.480" style="s2">States globally it&#39;s a different story</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.490" end="01:16:44.950" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of different rate</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.480" end="01:16:46.330" style="s2">dynamics I don&#39;t know exactly how it</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.950" end="01:16:47.820" style="s2">plays out there that&#39;s a decent</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.330" end="01:16:51.340" style="s2">framework though so if you can imagine</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.820" end="01:16:54.250" style="s2">scaling this - how many people are here</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.340" end="01:16:56.530" style="s2">about 300 so scaling this by two orders</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.250" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">of magnitude three doors of magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.530" end="01:16:59.770" style="s2">that&#39;s probably the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:02.260" style="s2">framework to be able to maneuver us</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.770" end="01:17:03.970" style="s2">across a transition the other big piece</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.260" end="01:17:05.620" style="s2">that would be fantastic as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.970" end="01:17:07.930" style="s2">is if we could get a critical mass of</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.620" end="01:17:10.120" style="s2">elites in the next two or three years</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.930" end="01:17:11.110" style="s2">that&#39;s where things get very sketchy we</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.120" end="01:17:12.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have a lot of time for that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.110" end="01:17:14.590" style="s2">need to get a critical mass of elites to</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.520" end="01:17:18.130" style="s2">be able to actually be willing to take</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.590" end="01:17:20.200" style="s2">the risk that the game they won is going</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.130" end="01:17:22.690" style="s2">away and they&#39;re gonna be the folks who</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.200" end="01:17:24.280" style="s2">are gonna make the next game happen we</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.690" end="01:17:27.670" style="s2">might be able to do without that but</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.280" end="01:17:29.410" style="s2">probably not I have a quick one so in</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.670" end="01:17:31.150" style="s2">the intermediate transition phase</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.410" end="01:17:34.120" style="s2">imagine a world that basically doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.150" end="01:17:35.260" style="s2">have any intellectual property taxes and</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.120" end="01:17:37.570" style="s2">then for the long game</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.260" end="01:17:39.969" style="s2">imagine a world where everybody</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.570" end="01:17:42.280" style="s2">understood the full meaning of this</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.969" end="01:17:46.510" style="s2">simple idea love is that which enables</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.280" end="01:17:48.280" style="s2">choice you really get that if you really</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.510" end="01:17:49.690" style="s2">really get that if you live by that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.280" end="01:17:52.510" style="s2">principle if everybody in the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.690" end="01:17:54.699" style="s2">understood that thoroughly the world</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.510" end="01:17:58.180" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t would absolutely be a better</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.699" end="01:18:01.300" style="s2">place as cliche as it is teeing up the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.180" end="01:18:04.690" style="s2">next question you talk about forming a</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.300" end="01:18:07.420" style="s2">collective that&#39;s aligned in feeling</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.690" end="01:18:10.989" style="s2">deeply interconnected what is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.420" end="01:18:15.040" style="s2">toolbox to keep us accountable to that</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.989" end="01:18:17.350" style="s2">state specific actions we could all be</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.040" end="01:18:19.620" style="s2">doing to keep ourselves accountable to</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.350" end="01:18:20.969" style="s2">really living in that state of</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.620" end="01:18:23.980" style="s2">interconnectivity</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.969" end="01:18:26.500" style="s2">whatever you want to call it so we have</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.980" end="01:18:27.940" style="s2">this idea that you we want to maintain a</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.500" end="01:18:29.530" style="s2">particular condition and there was a</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.940" end="01:18:31.480" style="s2">question that was asked about you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.530" end="01:18:33.219" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna be the enforcers of the loss</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.480" end="01:18:34.449" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna make the loss and this</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.219" end="01:18:36.100" style="s2">question strikes me as being very</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.449" end="01:18:38.800" style="s2">similar in some respects how do we</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.100" end="01:18:40.120" style="s2">maintain an integrity state we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.800" end="01:18:42.160" style="s2">it by having a special class of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.120" end="01:18:44.140" style="s2">that is essentially the enforcers the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.160" end="01:18:45.340" style="s2">police you know that&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.140" end="01:18:46.480" style="s2">version of the Stanford Prison</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.340" end="01:18:49.420" style="s2">Experiment and although it moves very</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.480" end="01:18:51.040" style="s2">slowly it ends up very ugly and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.420" end="01:18:52.540" style="s2">can&#39;t do it by basically trying to have</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.040" end="01:18:54.210" style="s2">everybody become the policeman and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.540" end="01:18:56.110" style="s2">watching everyone else that basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.210" end="01:18:57.820" style="s2">erodes what there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.110" end="01:19:00.040" style="s2">individual sovereignty and privacy it</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.820" end="01:19:03.160" style="s2">makes you essentially subject to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.040" end="01:19:05.350" style="s2">tyranny of the consensus and in effect</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.160" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2">you end up not being able to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.350" end="01:19:07.420" style="s2">at all because there&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.400" end="01:19:08.680" style="s2">be somebody out there is going to</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.420" end="01:19:11.080" style="s2">disagree with the basic premise of what</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.680" end="01:19:12.550" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about so in effect we</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.080" end="01:19:14.199" style="s2">need a third model we need something</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.550" end="01:19:15.969" style="s2">that is neither you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.199" end="01:19:18.219" style="s2">top-down kind of structured</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.969" end="01:19:20.199" style="s2">organizational model of trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.219" end="01:19:22.000" style="s2">consensus or we&#39;re essentially the sort</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.199" end="01:19:23.320" style="s2">of bottom-up thing which is just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.000" end="01:19:24.610" style="s2">gonna take so long that no one&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.320" end="01:19:25.870" style="s2">gonna actually come to agreement before</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.610" end="01:19:28.300" style="s2">the problem in crisis has already passed</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.870" end="01:19:30.520" style="s2">right we need something that&#39;s faster</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.300" end="01:19:31.600" style="s2">than that and yet not necessarily has</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.520" end="01:19:34.060" style="s2">the disadvantages of the top-down</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.600" end="01:19:36.430" style="s2">technique the kind of model that comes</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.060" end="01:19:38.530" style="s2">to mind for me is is sort of this</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.430" end="01:19:40.810" style="s2">peer-to-peer relationship that computers</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.530" end="01:19:43.630" style="s2">can set up to be add you have a protocol</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.810" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">of communication and if neither computer</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.630" end="01:19:48.190" style="s2">is is you know disagreeing about the</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:50.170" style="s2">protocol then an effective transaction</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.190" end="01:19:51.359" style="s2">happens information moves across one</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.170" end="01:19:53.249" style="s2">machine to another</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.359" end="01:19:54.629" style="s2">well nobody is essentially the enforcer</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.249" end="01:19:55.949" style="s2">of the protocol if you don&#39;t speak the</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.629" end="01:19:57.209" style="s2">protocol if you don&#39;t know how to speak</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.949" end="01:19:59.369" style="s2">the language you don&#39;t end up</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.209" end="01:20:01.139" style="s2">communicating all right the transactions</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.369" end="01:20:03.300" style="s2">that are necessary to to move resources</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.139" end="01:20:05.669" style="s2">around just don&#39;t happen because nobody</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.300" end="01:20:07.229" style="s2">wants to talk to you so in effect the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.669" end="01:20:09.300" style="s2">real thing here is is that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.229" end="01:20:11.339" style="s2">enforce communication but by having</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.300" end="01:20:12.959" style="s2">communication by you know learning the</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.339" end="01:20:15.179" style="s2">language and learning to develop some</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.959" end="01:20:17.550" style="s2">sort of consensus technology of having</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.179" end="01:20:20.249" style="s2">the conversation that that process tends</p>

<p begin="01:20:51.989" end="01:20:56.070" style="s2">next question was asked as it was</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.280" end="01:20:58.769" style="s2">something that we all faced in winning</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.070" end="01:21:01.320" style="s2">this event on is gaining a holistic</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.309" end="01:21:16.949" style="s2">white men and so how do we gain that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.849" end="01:21:20.909" style="s2">holistic perspective how do we continue</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.949" end="01:21:24.239" style="s2">to really encourage diversity and ensure</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.329" end="01:21:43.199" style="s2">just an emphasis on diversity then you</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.369" end="01:21:45.089" style="s2">end up with so many different points of</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.600" end="01:23:30.210" style="s2">in in a landscape you&#39;ve got multiple</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.790" end="01:23:33.670" style="s2">peaks and multiple valleys so as</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.210" end="01:23:35.320" style="s2">nature&#39;s evolving and we see increased</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.670" end="01:23:37.930" style="s2">orderly complexity and kind of a</p>

<p begin="01:23:37.930" end="01:23:42.520" style="s2">creatures right like with humans kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:44.740" style="s2">at the end of that chain so far viruses</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.520" end="01:23:46.030" style="s2">are still evolving - right corals are</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.740" end="01:23:47.350" style="s2">still evolving - there&#39;s a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.030" end="01:23:48.490" style="s2">of different things that are adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.350" end="01:23:50.950" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some things that are</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.490" end="01:23:52.510" style="s2">not adaptive the same is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.950" end="01:23:54.370" style="s2">true in the future of civilization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.510" end="01:23:56.830" style="s2">not going to be a homogeneous here is</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.370" end="01:23:58.030" style="s2">the worldview or here is the aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.830" end="01:23:59.650" style="s2">that everyone has there will be an</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.030" end="01:24:02.140" style="s2">adaptive landscape of a number of ways</p>

<p begin="01:24:06.820" end="01:24:09.970" style="s2">that are all functional that all meet</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.470" end="01:24:12.250" style="s2">the necessary and sufficient criteria</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.970" end="01:24:15.760" style="s2">for a civilization that&#39;s viable and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.250" end="01:24:16.780" style="s2">that means that there can be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.760" end="01:24:21.570" style="s2">relationship across</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.780" end="01:24:23.889" style="s2">right not just inexorable an</p>

<p begin="01:24:23.889" end="01:24:28.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s like do we want diversity well</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.690" end="01:24:31.059" style="s2">some the kinds of diversity that lead to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.750" end="01:24:34.000" style="s2">inexorable breakdown in conflict</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.059" end="01:24:35.829" style="s2">we don&#39;t want right but there&#39;s a truth</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.000" end="01:24:37.270" style="s2">part in those elements that we need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.829" end="01:24:39.429" style="s2">be able to hold the kinds of diversity</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.270" end="01:24:40.750" style="s2">that lead to multiple perspectives that</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.429" end="01:24:43.449" style="s2">lead to synergy and emergence is</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.750" end="01:24:45.119" style="s2">critical so synergy across a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.449" end="01:24:47.710" style="s2">the same thing doesn&#39;t really happen</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.119" end="01:24:50.469" style="s2">right synergy across homogeny you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.710" end="01:24:54.789" style="s2">get very much emergent property so this</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.469" end="01:24:58.929" style="s2">is it you know this is a key dynamic one</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.789" end="01:25:01.480" style="s2">thing I would say about it is so how do</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.929" end="01:25:03.579" style="s2">we seek out different perspectives we</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.480" end="01:25:06.309" style="s2">have a friend who just did his PhD</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.579" end="01:25:08.440" style="s2">dissertation on studying higher stages</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.309" end="01:25:09.579" style="s2">of human development within which as</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.440" end="01:25:10.780" style="s2">soon as you even say that</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.579" end="01:25:13.960" style="s2">it bothers people right what does it</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.780" end="01:25:16.690" style="s2">mean higher stage and yet development</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.960" end="01:25:18.789" style="s2">isn&#39;t nothing right and one of the key</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.690" end="01:25:20.710" style="s2">things that he identified was something</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.789" end="01:25:22.960" style="s2">that had been previously thought to be a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.710" end="01:25:24.610" style="s2">key definer which was perspective taking</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:27.039" style="s2">the ability to take multiple</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.610" end="01:25:30.280" style="s2">perspectives was less relevant than</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.039" end="01:25:32.349" style="s2">perspective seeking the ability the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.280" end="01:25:33.849" style="s2">predisposition to seek lots of</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.349" end="01:25:35.079" style="s2">perspectives and then the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.849" end="01:25:37.869" style="s2">actually do it well and then the ability</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.079" end="01:25:39.820" style="s2">to synthesize across those but the most</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.869" end="01:25:42.520" style="s2">critical part that they identified was</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.820" end="01:25:45.789" style="s2">the impetus to actually seek other</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.520" end="01:25:47.440" style="s2">perspectives so this is important one</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.789" end="01:25:53.469" style="s2">thing else I&#39;ll say about it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.440" end="01:25:55.539" style="s2">hard notice how many times has happened</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.469" end="01:25:57.340" style="s2">for you where someone has a worldview</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.539" end="01:25:58.719" style="s2">that actually bugs the out of you</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.340" end="01:26:00.789" style="s2">right that where there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.719" end="01:26:04.179" style="s2">you feel is sacred that it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.789" end="01:26:05.710" style="s2">their their worldview doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.179" end="01:26:08.400" style="s2">and could even damage and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.710" end="01:26:11.050" style="s2">willing to inside go to war with them</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.400" end="01:26:14.530" style="s2">but again we just define that moving</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.050" end="01:26:17.469" style="s2">forward all wars are lose-lose so what</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.530" end="01:26:19.739" style="s2">does it mean to be like ok how do I deal</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.469" end="01:26:19.739" style="s2">with this</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.099" end="01:26:24.940" style="s2">so one thing I would say is to just</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.690" end="01:26:27.309" style="s2">actually sit in that we have to and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.940" end="01:26:29.889" style="s2">figure it out it&#39;s a part of it actually</p>

<p begin="01:26:58.449" end="01:27:04.989" style="s2">so the question is can we rely on</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.190" end="01:27:07.269" style="s2">emergence can we do the work</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.989" end="01:27:10.840" style="s2">individually to be available for</p>

<p begin="01:27:13.059" end="01:27:16.179" style="s2">smooth and fast enough or is there</p>

<p begin="01:27:32.650" end="01:27:37.870" style="s2">think about that I think that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.710" end="01:27:40.420" style="s2">we can&#39;t rely on the notion of emergence</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.870" end="01:27:41.770" style="s2">I think that if we try to rely on the</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.420" end="01:27:45.250" style="s2">notion of emergence that we are in</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.770" end="01:27:47.380" style="s2">effect you know having a kind of false</p>

<p begin="01:27:50.920" end="01:27:55.930" style="s2">there I think that emergence will</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.170" end="01:27:57.520" style="s2">actually happen but I think there will</p>

<p begin="01:28:07.180" end="01:28:11.350" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the question is not well</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.739" end="01:28:13.300" style="s2">formed that&#39;s not the way to think about</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.350" end="01:28:15.070" style="s2">it the way to think about it is to tune</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.300" end="01:28:18.310" style="s2">into who you are and what you&#39;re here to</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.070" end="01:28:20.200" style="s2">do and do that completely and if</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.310" end="01:28:22.060" style="s2">everybody did that do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.200" end="01:28:27.280" style="s2">would be enough to guide us through this</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.060" end="01:28:28.390" style="s2">transition it doesn&#39;t matter yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.280" end="01:28:36.400" style="s2">think I have to agree with Jordan on</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.390" end="01:28:37.900" style="s2">this is it is it going to be enough to</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.400" end="01:28:39.489" style="s2">get to the transition is an unanswerable</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.900" end="01:28:41.560" style="s2">question for anyone right now</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.489" end="01:28:43.330" style="s2">we&#39;re trying really hard to just</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.560" end="01:28:45.070" style="s2">identify the concepts that we think</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.330" end="01:28:46.480" style="s2">might be the attributes of what solution</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.070" end="01:28:49.360" style="s2">might look like what characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.480" end="01:28:51.130" style="s2">does a solution need to have that list</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.360" end="01:28:52.450" style="s2">at this particular point is unbounded we</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.130" end="01:28:53.860" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether everything on it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.450" end="01:28:56.110" style="s2">necessary we don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.860" end="01:28:57.640" style="s2">sufficient we know it&#39;s important to ask</p>

<p begin="01:29:04.360" end="01:29:09.430" style="s2">questions of some extent is not well</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.680" end="01:29:12.270" style="s2">formed but it&#39;s interesting I will spend</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.430" end="01:29:12.270" style="s2">some more time thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.119" end="01:29:18.730" style="s2">which knowing forests means you will</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.280" end="01:29:20.800" style="s2">write a definitive essay in the next 48</p>

<p begin="01:29:47.580" end="01:29:51.730" style="s2">meditation is important if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.260" end="01:29:53.020" style="s2">spend a little bit of time by yourself</p>

<p begin="01:30:15.599" end="01:30:20.040" style="s2">then you can begin to account for the</p>

<p begin="01:30:38.949" end="01:30:42.520" style="s2">with each other seriously like holding</p>

<p begin="01:30:52.060" end="01:30:54.880" style="s2">if you do this and you do that I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.380" end="01:30:55.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve got about as good an answer as</p>

<p begin="01:33:29.550" end="01:33:38.930" style="s2">acquaintances with a thousand that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.460" end="01:33:38.930" style="s2">rate limiter on civilization</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.130" end="01:33:51.200" style="s2">one of the primary limiters the way that</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.100" end="01:33:53.390" style="s2">we went about fabricating an identity</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.200" end="01:33:55.550" style="s2">that worked particularly in middle</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.390" end="01:33:57.310" style="s2">school and high school to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.550" end="01:33:59.630" style="s2">allow us to endure and survive the</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.310" end="01:34:03.020" style="s2">perhaps of the crisis that is reality</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.630" end="01:34:04.340" style="s2">that we live in right now and of course</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.020" end="01:34:05.300" style="s2">what that does is that means you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.340" end="01:34:08.060" style="s2">engage in a lot of stuff that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.300" end="01:34:11.630" style="s2">talking about and that thing and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.060" end="01:34:13.610" style="s2">my called ego mind here tries to protect</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.630" end="01:34:17.960" style="s2">itself and inhibits thinking and it</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.610" end="01:34:19.280" style="s2">reacts to things and so nothing works if</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.960" end="01:34:21.140" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that in between you and other</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.280" end="01:34:22.130" style="s2">people so that&#39;s another major rhythm</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.140" end="01:34:23.660" style="s2">there the nice thing about that is that</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.130" end="01:34:25.910" style="s2">you&#39;re actually needed you can just get</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.660" end="01:34:32.690" style="s2">rid of it it&#39;s a turn-off and then go</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.910" end="01:34:34.580" style="s2">back to being an authentic being so</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.690" end="01:34:38.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve got one last question that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.580" end="01:34:41.690" style="s2">all three of you and that is what is</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.090" end="01:34:44.780" style="s2">your big bet I know you&#39;ve formed a</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.690" end="01:34:46.220" style="s2">think tank called deep code there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.780" end="01:34:49.250" style="s2">limited amount of time there&#39;s a limited</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.220" end="01:34:56.000" style="s2">amount of resource what&#39;s your big bet</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.250" end="01:35:01.690" style="s2">and where the biggest leverages do you</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.000" end="01:35:01.690" style="s2">want to do functional groups Oh God</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.929" end="01:35:13.070" style="s2">I think that for my own part I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.860" end="01:35:16.489" style="s2">basically having the hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.070" end="01:35:19.429" style="s2">there is a theory of ethics that will</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.489" end="01:35:21.769" style="s2">allow us to close the ethical gap that</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.429" end="01:35:25.039" style="s2">will allow us to move from a</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.769" end="01:35:28.010" style="s2">consideration of choice effective choice</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.039" end="01:35:30.670" style="s2">good choices which is heretofore open</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.010" end="01:35:33.559" style="s2">based purely on the notion of opinion to</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.670" end="01:35:35.840" style="s2">something which has a rigorous more</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.559" end="01:35:38.630" style="s2">mathematical character which isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.840" end="01:35:40.400" style="s2">say that I&#39;m expecting that choices be</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.630" end="01:35:43.010" style="s2">made only on the basis of some</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.400" end="01:35:44.900" style="s2">intellectual premise but that by</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.010" end="01:35:47.570" style="s2">combining the hearts and the value</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.900" end="01:35:49.429" style="s2">systems that we have with a toolkit that</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.570" end="01:35:52.849" style="s2">allows us to integrate those things in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.429" end="01:35:55.849" style="s2">sane way then we can move the dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.849" end="01:35:57.289" style="s2">to a position that is considerably</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.849" end="01:36:00.349" style="s2">deeper than could be reached by just</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.289" end="01:36:02.119" style="s2">simply any single point of view so in</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.349" end="01:36:04.639" style="s2">effect I guess you could say that for me</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.119" end="01:36:06.860" style="s2">the big bet is whether or not that</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.639" end="01:36:07.670" style="s2">ethical system is truly complete and</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.860" end="01:36:10.550" style="s2">actually works</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.670" end="01:36:13.519" style="s2">I have subjected it to every single test</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.550" end="01:36:15.949" style="s2">I can think of I have tried it in my own</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.519" end="01:36:18.769" style="s2">business I have tried it in many years</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.949" end="01:36:22.039" style="s2">since I have come where and become aware</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.769" end="01:36:26.150" style="s2">of these concepts and my hope is is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.039" end="01:36:28.400" style="s2">that is a component a kind of piece of</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.150" end="01:36:29.780" style="s2">architecture that that will actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.400" end="01:36:33.639" style="s2">work that will hold the weight that is</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.780" end="01:36:33.639" style="s2">that is in a sense to be placed on it</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.699" end="01:36:48.800" style="s2">so I could say something like my big bet</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.059" end="01:36:52.489" style="s2">is transforming macroeconomics and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.800" end="01:36:54.889" style="s2">because economics can be seen as an</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.489" end="01:36:57.230" style="s2">interface layer between our worldview</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.889" end="01:36:59.270" style="s2">and infrastructure right our worldview</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.230" end="01:37:02.239" style="s2">involves things like what do we value</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.270" end="01:37:03.739" style="s2">and who are we and what who is other and</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.239" end="01:37:07.130" style="s2">who are what are we connected to and</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.739" end="01:37:09.079" style="s2">then that&#39;s actually codified in an</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.130" end="01:37:10.610" style="s2">economic equation where the whale is</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.079" end="01:37:12.860" style="s2">worth something dead and not something</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.610" end="01:37:14.119" style="s2">alive and where oxygens not worth that</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.860" end="01:37:15.559" style="s2">much because there&#39;s lots of it and</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.119" end="01:37:17.150" style="s2">scare stuff is worth a lot even if we</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.559" end="01:37:19.909" style="s2">don&#39;t do anything with it right that the</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.150" end="01:37:22.010" style="s2">value equation that then predisposes</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.909" end="01:37:23.570" style="s2">what we confer resource to if you do</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.010" end="01:37:25.849" style="s2">these things will confer more resource</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.570" end="01:37:27.500" style="s2">or we confer power that way which then</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.849" end="01:37:29.030" style="s2">ends up determining which technologies</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.500" end="01:37:31.219" style="s2">get built which is where the physical</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.030" end="01:37:33.679" style="s2">power and the Darwinian senses and how</p>

<p begin="01:37:33.679" end="01:37:39.079" style="s2">are affected we could say that interface</p>

<p begin="01:37:41.420" end="01:37:47.030" style="s2">we could talk about a few processes to</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.369" end="01:37:49.760" style="s2">do that we could talk about a real-time</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.030" end="01:37:52.190" style="s2">balance sheet of the Commons where we</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.760" end="01:37:54.770" style="s2">have sensor grid an Internet of Things</p>
