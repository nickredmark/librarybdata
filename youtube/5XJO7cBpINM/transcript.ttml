<p begin="00:00:01.439" end="00:00:04.589" style="s2">guilty apart from one woman&#39;s testimony</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.820" end="00:00:05.700" style="s2">why would she put herself through that</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.589" end="00:00:07.470" style="s2">she wasn&#39;t telling the truth the</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:09.030" style="s2">Democrats turned the whole process into</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.470" end="00:00:10.920" style="s2">a show trial Cavanaugh was far too</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.030" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">partisan and angry in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.920" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">committee you can&#39;t abandon the rule of</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">law and submit to a mob mentality on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:19.699" style="s2">left David you all right so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">kind of slightly experimental podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.699" end="00:00:24.720" style="s2">based on how do you hold the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:27.570" style="s2">that both of those narratives are true</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.720" end="00:00:30.240" style="s2">at the same time because the reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.570" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this is because both Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.240" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">Pederson and some of the other members</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:38.030" style="s2">of the intellectual dark web have had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">lot of pushback for their comments on</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.030" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">Cavanaugh especially Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">which is the first time I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">seen him like really under attack from</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">his audience and he addressed it last</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">night in his live event and it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">feels it&#39;s an intro because this is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about a lot in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">podcast it&#39;s like how do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:01.199" style="s2">conversation that is not immediately</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">reactive goes beyond polarization I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.199" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">think this is a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">cultural moment to do that yeah for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the most interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:10.470" style="s2">right now about how this is all played</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.780" style="s2">out with Peterson the Weinsteins and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.470" end="00:01:14.939" style="s2">reaction that they&#39;ve had from within</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure what one would call them</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.939" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">they&#39;re fans or fans of the IDW in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">general but for me the whole point of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">the IDW is that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:28.020" style="s2">conversations in public it&#39;s a new way</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">of having conversations and implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.020" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">that is that you can have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:35.880" style="s2">without it devolving into reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the entire point and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.880" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">actually quite disappointed to see the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:44.549" style="s2">fervor and the kind of angst enos and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">aggression that was coming from within</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.549" end="00:01:47.970" style="s2">you know the the same groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">or the same people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:52.130" style="s2">supporting there was a lot more of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">reactivity than I would have thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.130" end="00:01:56.640" style="s2">especially considering the entire point</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:59.460" style="s2">of this is to be able to think out loud</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.640" end="00:02:00.329" style="s2">in public in good faith which has not</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.460" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">happened with this</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.329" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">yeah Brett&#39;s wife Heather hiring put out</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">a really interesting tweet which was you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.030" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">haven&#39;t demonstrated support for free</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">speech until you defend speech that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">hate and you haven&#39;t demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">support or an understanding of nuance</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">you defend it even when your side is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:20.550" style="s2">winning and this whole idea about nuance</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">I think is being able to hold</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.550" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">contradictory thoughts that as Brett</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">said in another tweet both of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">outcomes are unacceptable and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.540" style="s2">being presented by the system outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:32.070" style="s2">that are equally unacceptable like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.540" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">Hillary Trump election I think was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.070" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">kind of good example of that for this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:42.690" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the idea that any allegation</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">can destroy a man&#39;s career and needs to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">be believed absolutely and weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">of those allegations is quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:54.120" style="s2">unacceptable and you can&#39;t run a society</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">on that on that basis but equally this</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.120" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">is and this is where I personally come</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:03:01.530" style="s2">down I&#39;m going to sort of weighing up</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">all the evidence the most why this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.530" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">such a difficult situation is because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.830" style="s2">the Supreme Court is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">above politics and cavanaugh in his</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.830" end="00:03:17.430" style="s2">defense to the Senate explicitly made it</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:19.260" style="s2">political and attacked I&#39;ll read from</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.430" end="00:03:20.700" style="s2">her from his from his comment this whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.260" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">two-week effort has been a calculated</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.700" end="00:03:24.660" style="s2">orchestrated political hit fueled with</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.660" end="00:03:28.769" style="s2">the 2016 election fear that was at</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:30.989" style="s2">billons fairly stoked about my judicial</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.989" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">and millions of dollars in money from</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">outside left-wing opposition groups that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">may well all be true but he has to he is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">going to be on the Supreme Court which</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:45.450" style="s2">is going to have to rule on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">most politically charged issues how can</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:49.830" style="s2">the Supreme Court when it is dragged</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">into that debate be seen as any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.830" end="00:03:54.630" style="s2">arbiter and how do you pull out of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">us and them mentality which is what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.630" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">think Peterson was was alluding to when</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:00.930" style="s2">he said that he thought cabinet should</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">withdraw I just want to go back to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.930" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">point of nuance that Heather hiring had</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:06.660" style="s2">in her tweet which I thought was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:08.910" style="s2">good being able to just hold things</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.660" end="00:04:11.130" style="s2">without needing to find the right answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:13.290" style="s2">or the answer that confirms you know my</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.130" end="00:04:15.150" style="s2">previously held beliefs so obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.290" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">always easy and I think with the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.150" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">kavanah thing it&#39;s so emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">charged that people lose their grounding</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:25.289" style="s2">very easily on both sides but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:26.990" style="s2">other point is that I think there&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.289" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">all the flack that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.990" end="00:04:30.440" style="s2">I&#39;m guilty of this is Sahel okay all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">flak directed towards the social justice</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.440" end="00:04:36.500" style="s2">warrior kind of attitude and you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:40.220" style="s2">the regressive left I see just as much</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.500" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">reactivity from the right and that for</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.220" end="00:04:45.169" style="s2">me it&#39;s it&#39;s two sides of the same coin</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">I think this has to be a resolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.169" end="00:04:49.970" style="s2">beyond that where it&#39;s a new genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:52.430" style="s2">what the IDW is is supposed to be about</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.970" end="00:04:54.319" style="s2">again a new way of thinking and I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.430" end="00:04:57.229" style="s2">part of that new way of thinking is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.319" end="00:04:59.900" style="s2">around taking responsibility for our</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.229" end="00:05:01.099" style="s2">emotions in the moment and probably not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.900" end="00:05:03.229" style="s2">doing it online but that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.099" end="00:05:04.550" style="s2">conversation to have yeah it&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.229" end="00:05:06.159" style="s2">point that comes up as well like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.550" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">Peterson I think has been the main</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.159" end="00:05:13.039" style="s2">target of this because he has been</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:14.539" style="s2">identified as on one side of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.039" end="00:05:16.759" style="s2">culture divide and I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.539" end="00:05:18.440" style="s2">people who are following him see him as</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.759" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">an ally on that side of a culture divide</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.440" end="00:05:23.659" style="s2">like fighting back against identity</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">politics and so he I think has suffered</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.659" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">probably more than maybe Eric or Brett I</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">mean they&#39;ve got a lower profile anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">but they&#39;re not seen as figureheads for</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:36.229" style="s2">for something and but what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.380" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">is that I think when Peterson went on</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.229" end="00:05:41.659" style="s2">the marsh show and said we&#39;ll hang on</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:42.949" style="s2">how and you can&#39;t and they were there</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.659" end="00:05:44.180" style="s2">were a lot of people there being quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.949" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">dismissive of Trump&#39;s of course and he</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.180" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">said hang on you can&#39;t you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:50.690" style="s2">write off fifty percent of your people</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:53.539" style="s2">the same thing goes the other way and</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.690" end="00:05:57.139" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what is happening on</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.139" end="00:05:59.330" style="s2">was saying look you&#39;ve got to build a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:00.740" style="s2">dialogue with these people you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.330" end="00:06:03.500" style="s2">build a dialogue with Trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.740" end="00:06:04.699" style="s2">if you&#39;re on if you&#39;re more on the kind</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.699" end="00:06:10.159" style="s2">well you can&#39;t if you support him in</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.389" end="00:06:12.020" style="s2">that message of yes well you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.159" end="00:06:14.210" style="s2">have these conversations you can&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.020" end="00:06:15.620" style="s2">turn around and say well actually no we</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.210" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">just need to defeat these other people</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.620" end="00:06:19.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a contradiction otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.560" style="s2">have a divided country and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.940" end="00:06:23.599" style="s2">way of pulling out of this tailspin of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.560" end="00:06:26.569" style="s2">polarization I&#39;ve read a few things</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.599" end="00:06:29.090" style="s2">actually suggesting that Eric and Brett</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.569" end="00:06:30.740" style="s2">and possibly Peterson as well that there</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.090" end="00:06:31.699" style="s2">was an intent I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s true I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.740" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">think the interesting idea that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.699" end="00:06:37.190" style="s2">kind of an intentional this was all</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:39.110" style="s2">intentional in order to in a sense reach</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.190" end="00:06:39.800" style="s2">out an olive branch and separate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.110" end="00:06:41.030" style="s2">wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:43.550" style="s2">of who</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.030" end="00:06:45.350" style="s2">interested in this purely because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.550" end="00:06:47.150" style="s2">happens to support their political</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.350" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">agenda or Hugh&#39;s interested but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.150" end="00:06:50.150" style="s2">genuinely want another conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.190" style="s2">don&#39;t know but I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.150" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">interesting idea and what I think&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.190" end="00:06:56.270" style="s2">interesting about it is that it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.660" end="00:07:00.070" style="s2">this process does in a way separate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.270" end="00:07:04.010" style="s2">wheat from the chaff of who&#39;s who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.010" end="00:07:07.880" style="s2">it agree to a large enough dick we all</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.050" end="00:07:09.890" style="s2">have an ideology or somewhere but to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.880" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">large enough degree where you can listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.890" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">to something that challenges you and go</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">hmm yeah not sure but let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:18.770" style="s2">thinking and talking about it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">also for people watching this it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.770" end="00:07:22.460" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re thinking aloud and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">ongoing conversation I don&#39;t expect that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.460" end="00:07:26.330" style="s2">what we&#39;re putting forward we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:28.100" style="s2">saying this is the truth but we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:29.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a valuable addition we think this</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.100" end="00:07:34.490" style="s2">is a valuable cultural moment to be able</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.720" end="00:07:36.380" style="s2">to say how can we how can we see things</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.490" end="00:07:38.360" style="s2">from multiple perspectives in a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.380" end="00:07:41.350" style="s2">while holding on to truth while holding</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.360" end="00:07:44.300" style="s2">on to what is what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.350" end="00:07:47.690" style="s2">this other thing that that just I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.300" end="00:07:49.160" style="s2">reminded of is what I got a sense of but</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.690" end="00:07:50.390" style="s2">it was very interesting watching this be</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.160" end="00:07:51.890" style="s2">kind of the one of the first times that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.390" end="00:07:53.810" style="s2">Peters Peterson gets a lot of flack from</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.890" end="00:07:55.190" style="s2">people who don&#39;t like him really the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.810" end="00:07:56.870" style="s2">first time I can remember where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.190" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">gotten a lot of flack from people who do</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.870" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">like him and it reminded me of well I -</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:05.690" style="s2">words like projection and rejection so</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:09.320" style="s2">as often in like couples therapies</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.690" end="00:08:11.030" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a it&#39;s quite normal that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.320" end="00:08:13.340" style="s2">some in whatever kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.030" end="00:08:14.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of moment where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.340" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">projecting all this stuff onto this</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.900" end="00:08:17.630" style="s2">person so maybe like oh she&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:19.220" style="s2">woman in the world she&#39;s got all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.630" end="00:08:22.640" style="s2">qualities that actually are things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:24.200" style="s2">I&#39;m painting onto her and then at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.640" end="00:08:25.970" style="s2">point there&#39;s a realization of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.200" end="00:08:28.130" style="s2">you&#39;re your own individual person and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.970" end="00:08:30.350" style="s2">you&#39;re not actually a container for all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.130" end="00:08:31.910" style="s2">my projections and you&#39;re not being the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.350" end="00:08:34.070" style="s2">way I want you to be so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.910" end="00:08:35.720" style="s2">reject you and there&#39;s some element of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">that happening I think in in this whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.720" end="00:08:40.970" style="s2">conversation with the IDW in general</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.880" end="00:08:42.530" style="s2">with Peterson as probably inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.970" end="00:08:44.840" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen at some point</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.530" end="00:08:46.340" style="s2">well especially if Peterson is carrying</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.840" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">all of these kind of father projections</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.340" end="00:08:50.600" style="s2">from so many people it&#39;s like well daddy</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">so something I don&#39;t agree with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.600" end="00:08:57.290" style="s2">like a very difficult dynamic to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:08:59.090" style="s2">yeah to be exposed to so I think Brett</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.290" end="00:09:00.610" style="s2">Weinstein had the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.090" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">perspective of sort of meta perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.610" end="00:09:07.280" style="s2">which is that when the environment is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.810" style="s2">such that it selects for certain type of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.280" end="00:09:11.210" style="s2">behaviors the people who thrive in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.810" end="00:09:13.370" style="s2">environment other people that behave in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.210" end="00:09:14.750" style="s2">that are not the kind of people who put</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.370" end="00:09:16.760" style="s2">national interest first for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.750" end="00:09:19.940" style="s2">they&#39;re the people who know how to play</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:20.960" style="s2">the polarization game like Kavanagh I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.940" end="00:09:26.540" style="s2">mean Cavanaugh there was a most</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.960" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">blatantly political speech by a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.540" end="00:09:32.150" style="s2">aspiring Supreme Court justice that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:33.800" style="s2">anyone has ever heard so he played he</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.150" end="00:09:35.810" style="s2">deliberately played the political game</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.800" end="00:09:37.400" style="s2">looking to polarize knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.810" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">Republicans had that none those numbers</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.400" end="00:09:43.030" style="s2">and now he&#39;s a Supreme Court justice</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:47.630" style="s2">what that does to America going forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.030" end="00:09:49.310" style="s2">looks very dangerous from the outside if</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.630" end="00:09:51.260" style="s2">the Supreme Court is called in to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.310" end="00:09:53.630" style="s2">adjudicate on an election for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.260" end="00:09:54.620" style="s2">how can it and here&#39;s the despite</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.630" end="00:09:56.600" style="s2">deciding vote</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.620" end="00:09:58.610" style="s2">how can half the country have confidence</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.600" end="00:10:00.500" style="s2">of that decision is being made for</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.610" end="00:10:03.350" style="s2">anything other than political reasons it</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.500" end="00:10:05.780" style="s2">just looks like it just looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.350" end="00:10:09.620" style="s2">an accelerating process and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.780" end="00:10:12.100" style="s2">concern that I think Brett probably has</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.620" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">has the most interesting take on of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.100" end="00:10:16.520" style="s2">where does this go going forward as this</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:18.860" style="s2">continues to spiral</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.520" end="00:10:22.970" style="s2">it really looks almost impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.860" end="00:10:23.450" style="s2">for anyone to come up to or if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.970" end="00:10:25.250" style="s2">an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.450" end="00:10:27.530" style="s2">he also frames it in what an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.250" end="00:10:29.450" style="s2">what an opportunity for someone to come</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.530" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">in and be a hero that could have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.450" end="00:10:36.470" style="s2">Cavanaugh to say look I&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:37.790" style="s2">I&#39;ve been vindicated I but I put the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.470" end="00:10:39.740" style="s2">national interest first</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.790" end="00:10:41.630" style="s2">but as Brett says the kind of people put</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.740" end="00:10:45.290" style="s2">the national interest first are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.630" end="00:10:47.800" style="s2">selected for in this environment so it&#39;s</p>
