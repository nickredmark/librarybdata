<p begin="00:19:18.510" end="00:19:23.700" style="s2">okay so we have time for a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.970" end="00:19:31.809" style="s2">here&#39;s a question from des if one tries</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.950" end="00:19:33.340" style="s2">to define meditation from perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.809" end="00:19:35.140" style="s2">distractions should the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.340" end="00:19:38.110" style="s2">meditation be one to rise above</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.140" end="00:19:43.450" style="s2">distractions allusions to the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.110" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">to address the distractions in real 3 or</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.450" end="00:19:47.020" style="s2">a mix of both address what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:52.270" style="s2">addressable and ignored it was beyond</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.020" end="00:19:54.520" style="s2">control or something else so the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.270" end="00:19:58.270" style="s2">of distraction is definitely when your</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.520" end="00:20:01.419" style="s2">so when I assume that what you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.270" end="00:20:03.880" style="s2">yes is the practice of applying inquire</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.419" end="00:20:06.700" style="s2">and mindfulness to the distractions the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.880" end="00:20:09.460" style="s2">purpose is not to make the distractions</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.700" end="00:20:13.960" style="s2">go away the purpose is to become aware</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.460" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">of any of patterns that the distractions</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.960" end="00:20:19.270" style="s2">are revealing patterns in mind and body</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re doing within Hara and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.270" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">mindfulness trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:25.770" style="s2">consciousness into something that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:29.230" style="s2">normally operating unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.770" end="00:20:31.720" style="s2">automatically reactively defensively and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.230" end="00:20:35.470" style="s2">then what you&#39;re trying to do is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.720" end="00:20:38.309" style="s2">see and try to realize in which way this</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.470" end="00:20:40.840" style="s2">is limiting you constraining you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.309" end="00:20:42.250" style="s2">where that really takes it was when</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.840" end="00:20:43.900" style="s2">those patterns are operative in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.250" end="00:20:46.360" style="s2">life you get some flexibility and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.900" end="00:20:51.549" style="s2">freedom so you can see through the ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.360" end="00:20:53.620" style="s2">in which they might be misleading you so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.549" end="00:20:55.240" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a middle path you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.620" end="00:20:57.850" style="s2">trying to eradicate them or just simply</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.240" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">rise above them or write you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.850" end="00:21:03.010" style="s2">to see through them in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:05.470" style="s2">first becoming aware of them the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.010" end="00:21:08.169" style="s2">patterns alright and then looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.470" end="00:21:11.740" style="s2">through them see trying to see how they</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.169" end="00:21:17.260" style="s2">potentially limit or to store or confine</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.740" end="00:21:20.409" style="s2">your mind and your body so that you you</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.790" end="00:24:07.650" style="s2">just sort of feel nice and pleasant then</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.250" end="00:24:09.270" style="s2">that should be treated as a distraction</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:42.770" style="s2">just savor it because the the point here</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.520" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">is that you are now being you&#39;re now a</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:54.210" style="s2">trying to more and more aspire into it I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:24:55.890" style="s2">hope that&#39;s helpful and like I said so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.210" end="00:24:57.180" style="s2">if it&#39;s the fur trade like I said if</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.890" end="00:25:02.250" style="s2">it&#39;s more of this sort of spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.180" end="00:25:04.950" style="s2">Praja then drop whatever other intent</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.250" end="00:25:08.760" style="s2">you have for your practice and then live</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.950" end="00:25:10.560" style="s2">into that live into that but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.760" end="00:25:12.510" style="s2">just simple you come out you just feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.560" end="00:25:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of good and peaceful and sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.510" end="00:25:15.230" style="s2">of contentedness that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.160" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">distraction it&#39;s one of the most</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.740" end="00:25:27.170" style="s2">pleasant that&#39;s a distraction and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.540" end="00:25:29.910" style="s2">need to return to your breath</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.910" end="00:25:32.970" style="s2">recently I&#39;ve done a few sips outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.500" end="00:25:34.770" style="s2">in nature there sitting outdoors afford</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.970" end="00:25:37.290" style="s2">anything to a practice then sitting</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.770" end="00:25:38.780" style="s2">indoors doesn&#39;t I generally that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.290" end="00:25:41.010" style="s2">brave of you Matthew maybe it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.780" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re at right now generally I</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.010" end="00:25:47.670" style="s2">don&#39;t recommend for novices to sit</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:50.940" style="s2">outdoors because it tends to be too</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.670" end="00:25:52.440" style="s2">challenging I had a whole month I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.940" end="00:25:53.850" style="s2">it was about four or five years into my</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.440" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">practice where</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.850" end="00:26:00.670" style="s2">outdoors and it&#39;s very because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.730" style="s2">difficult because once you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.670" end="00:26:06.070" style="s2">sitting for silent not moving for like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.730" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">four or five minutes everything thinks</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.070" end="00:26:09.100" style="s2">you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:12.130" style="s2">you know insects land on new things</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.100" end="00:26:13.960" style="s2">crawl over you I had a guy I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:15.610" style="s2">sitting near a tree he was on one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.960" end="00:26:19.200" style="s2">those big walk and he coming cut grass</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.610" end="00:26:24.340" style="s2">right around me so I generally recommend</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.200" end="00:26:25.900" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s not something you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.340" end="00:26:27.340" style="s2">do as a novice and you can do it outside</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.900" end="00:26:29.620" style="s2">what you can do is you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.340" end="00:26:31.990" style="s2">practice and then move into a thing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.620" end="00:26:33.970" style="s2">what you should do is you should go onto</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.990" end="00:26:35.710" style="s2">my channel and see if some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.970" end="00:26:37.660" style="s2">discussions I&#39;ve had with rage Kelly or</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.710" end="00:26:39.880" style="s2">actually even better go into Rafe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.660" end="00:26:42.730" style="s2">Channel and he has an outdoor of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.880" end="00:26:44.260" style="s2">practice called sit spotting so I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.730" end="00:26:46.150" style="s2">you would do basically get into</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.260" end="00:26:48.370" style="s2">everything I&#39;ve taught you I think as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.150" end="00:26:50.170" style="s2">way of increasing your sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.370" end="00:26:52.210" style="s2">alertness and then what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.170" end="00:26:54.309" style="s2">then change your attention outward and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.210" end="00:26:55.540" style="s2">you try you keep your eyes closed but</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.309" end="00:26:56.679" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to listen to everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.540" end="00:26:59.140" style="s2">that&#39;s happened and you&#39;re listening to</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.140" end="00:27:04.150" style="s2">things moving about and what this does</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.420" end="00:27:07.240" style="s2">is this really enlivens your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.150" end="00:27:09.580" style="s2">pick up on complex dynamic patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.240" end="00:27:11.920" style="s2">your environment in an integrated and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.580" end="00:27:14.020" style="s2">flowing fashion so I would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.920" end="00:27:15.880" style="s2">like I said my general recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.020" end="00:27:19.000" style="s2">for analysis is don&#39;t sit outside</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.880" end="00:27:21.490" style="s2">initially but if you working for you do</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.000" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">this practice find your core for perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.490" end="00:27:25.840" style="s2">do a basic the past month or a basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.950" end="00:27:29.530" style="s2">nutta or maybe even a bit of Praja and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.840" end="00:27:30.970" style="s2">then once you&#39;ve gone into raves channel</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.530" end="00:27:32.559" style="s2">or looked at some of the videos i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.970" end="00:27:34.450" style="s2">done with him and he talks about sit</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.559" end="00:27:36.700" style="s2">spotting you could try this it&#39;s funning</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.450" end="00:27:42.400" style="s2">practice I think it&#39;s a really excellent</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.700" end="00:27:43.059" style="s2">recommendation human ease rage five nice</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.400" end="00:27:44.830" style="s2">to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.059" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">sometimes I find it difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.830" end="00:27:48.730" style="s2">maintain mindfulness in everyday life it</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">becomes very exhausting till I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.730" end="00:27:53.220" style="s2">burning out on mindfulness especially in</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:56.650" style="s2">retreats this can be very hard yes I</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.220" end="00:27:59.050" style="s2">strongly recommend for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.650" end="00:28:01.179" style="s2">learning to not go into retreat until</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.050" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">they&#39;ve been practicing seriously in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.179" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">diligent manner with a Sangha for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:08.110" style="s2">minimum of a year retreats I think are</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:12.429" style="s2">Retreat is like trying to immediately</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.299" end="00:28:37.690" style="s2">what can come up for people there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.750" end="00:28:40.630" style="s2">lot of things that I would say take your</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.690" end="00:28:44.830" style="s2">time I recommend not trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.630" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">mindful all day initially because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.830" end="00:28:48.910" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s forcing it that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.500" style="s2">middle path what you&#39;re trying to do is</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.500" end="00:29:36.160" style="s2">breaths of mindfulness and then see how</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.710" end="00:29:37.990" style="s2">much you can naturally let it integrate</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.160" end="00:29:40.540" style="s2">with what&#39;s happening around you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.990" end="00:29:42.790" style="s2">then just start moving into your day and</p>

<p begin="00:30:12.130" end="00:30:16.300" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do as we move into we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.800" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">going to do some of these advanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.300" end="00:30:19.230" style="s2">classes and then as we start moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:21.270" style="s2">towards the wisdom Sangha</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.230" end="00:30:25.620" style="s2">we&#39;re going to take the width of an IPA</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.270" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">a course very analogous to the course we</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.620" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">did the 10-week course we did which was</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:33.000" style="s2">very much from sort of a Buddhist Dallas</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:35.250" style="s2">perspective and then the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.000" end="00:30:37.169" style="s2">Hypatia is the wisdom cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.250" end="00:30:39.419" style="s2">practices and the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.169" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">framework from the Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.419" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">which is largely you know the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">tradition that comes out of Socrates the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:50.400" style="s2">the epicurean stoic and most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:51.960" style="s2">the Neoplatonic tradition I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.400" end="00:30:53.549" style="s2">follow that through so we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.960" end="00:30:56.190" style="s2">going to come to that we&#39;re definitely</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.549" end="00:30:58.169" style="s2">going to come to that I would recommend</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.169" end="00:31:02.400" style="s2">not immediately leap into it but I would</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.660" end="00:31:04.860" style="s2">recommend getting the two texts by</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.400" end="00:31:06.780" style="s2">Arthur vers Lewis that I recommend it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.860" end="00:31:11.040" style="s2">you because they will give you more of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.780" end="00:31:13.290" style="s2">sort of a philosophical framework so</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.040" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">that will help to bridge what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.290" end="00:31:17.730" style="s2">learning here into the wisdom of my pace</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.600" end="00:31:20.010" style="s2">your course but it&#39;s definitely of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.730" end="00:31:24.630" style="s2">course we&#39;re going to do together and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.010" end="00:31:28.740" style="s2">then what what you should have is sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.630" end="00:31:31.080" style="s2">of these two very comprehensive I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.740" end="00:31:32.669" style="s2">like these adjectives because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.080" end="00:31:34.950" style="s2">born out of colonialism but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.669" end="00:31:38.520" style="s2">what adjectives to use that we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.950" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">basically an Eastern Rite though Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.520" end="00:31:41.669" style="s2">wisdom traditions that I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:31:41.669" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">and then the Western wisdom tradition</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.429" end="00:31:48.630" style="s2">informed by cognitive science and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.760" style="s2">these are the two great lenses the two</p>
