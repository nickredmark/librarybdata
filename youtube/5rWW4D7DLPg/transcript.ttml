<p begin="00:19:13.340" end="00:19:19.399" style="s2">question from Karima you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.000" end="00:19:22.549" style="s2">something about time yesterday seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.399" end="00:19:24.289" style="s2">like so long ago that&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.549" end="00:19:27.169" style="s2">metaphysical pun well done</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.289" end="00:19:29.090" style="s2">have you read this book or would</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.169" end="00:19:33.409" style="s2">recommend it existential and ontological</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.090" end="00:19:38.179" style="s2">dimension of time in Heidegger and dojin</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.409" end="00:19:42.230" style="s2">I read a similar book by Maseo Ave I</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.179" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">wonder if that&#39;s the same one</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.230" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">it sounds like an excellent book the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:51.460" style="s2">book I read by Ave comparing Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:54.830" style="s2">and dojin on time was also very good</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.460" end="00:19:57.770" style="s2">let me check into this crema and Alaska</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.830" end="00:19:59.659" style="s2">Mar to repost that question tomorrow and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.770" end="00:20:02.809" style="s2">see if the a by book that I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.659" end="00:20:04.909" style="s2">of us is the one that you&#39;re thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.809" end="00:20:06.950" style="s2">if not I&#39;ll try and take a look into it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.909" end="00:20:12.860" style="s2">and get back to you but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.950" end="00:20:15.289" style="s2">that&#39;s very good so pleasure doubt Brett</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.860" end="00:20:16.820" style="s2">when you do solo let&#39;s do to get you</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.289" end="00:20:19.010" style="s2"> do you do it aloud or in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.820" end="00:20:21.649" style="s2">head definitely aloud it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.010" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">important to do the recitation it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.649" end="00:20:27.110" style="s2">important to be hearing physically</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:29.539" style="s2">hearing and even sometimes resonating</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.110" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">almost like the chanting so times the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.539" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">Luxio becomes almost chant like for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:39.260" style="s2">so definitely you should say it aloud</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:43.220" style="s2">you should definitely say it aloud so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.260" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">know we need to end right at by 10 today</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.220" end="00:20:49.309" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s all we&#39;re gonna have</p>
