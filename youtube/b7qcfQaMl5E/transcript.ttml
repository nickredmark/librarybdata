<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">capitalist um you can see this in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">margaret thatcher&#39;s statement such as</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">like there is no alternative</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">uh and then fisher also pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">the assassination and coup against</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:16.720" style="s2">salvador allende in chile um</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">as a major starting point like the nail</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.720" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">in the coffin</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">that that creates capitalist realism</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">because it offered an</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">alternative both to western capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">as well as soviet-style authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">which is an important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:33.840" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">that runs throughout fisher from</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">through all of his writings is a</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">of the more authoritarian elements that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">were associated</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">with communism through the you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">actually existing socialism as it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">known to call</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">so then acid communism fischer late in</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">his life</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">he was working on the book acid</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:01.199" style="s2">communism right before his death</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">and he the the intro to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.199" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">was published in the repeater collection</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">k-punk which is mostly</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">his old blogs some interviews</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">uh and some music writing so and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:15.520" style="s2">also contains the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">unfinished introduction to acid</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">communism which he sums up</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">kind of as the convergence of class</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">socialist feminist consciousness raising</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:28.160" style="s2">and psychedelic consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:29.759" style="s2">the fusion of new social movements with</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">the communist project</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.759" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">an unprecedented ascetician of everyday</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">so kind of looking back and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">seeing how the in the 60s and 70s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">the counterculture movements never quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">were fully taken serious by the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:54.080" style="s2">left and vice versa so a wish for those</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">to come back together</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.080" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">uh because in those movements</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">the important thing is the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.800" style="s2">as a space</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">and as a way of perceiving reality the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.800" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">deals with both space and time it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">folding of the outside in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">and the inside out it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">erasure of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">boundaries of the self in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:22.319" style="s2">the mind and the body</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">and importantly it does not only do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.319" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">drugs</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">you know we could also point to things</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">like meditation art</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">or especially music as it is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:33.360" style="s2">more of a temporal art form than say a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">painting or something like that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.360" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">forces you</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">to engage with time in a specific way</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">uh so we find that it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">deal with the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">um to engage the imagination to</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">re-engage the imagination which has been</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">crushed</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">by capitalism um and also to save the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">from being colonized by capitalism uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">because this is a very possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">threat that we see to this um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">the various ways we could that you could</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">have the psychedelic itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">be colonized um i think there&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">historical examples here such as</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">the original counterculture movements</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:19.120" style="s2">you know like the hippies and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">actually became much more conservative</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">you have big capitalist figures such as</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">such as steve jobs or like</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">the people that created whole foods you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">know actually saying that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:34.399" style="s2">psychedelics in their past were very</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">important for them and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.399" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">put them where they are now you see this</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:40.640" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">in workplace mindfulness practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">um you know large fortune 500 companies</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:48.839" style="s2">that also have their workers</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">engage in yoga breaks</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.839" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">or tech startups in silicon valley where</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">almost everyone is micro dosing lsd</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">or psilocybin mushrooms they&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">taken the radical dimension</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">that the psychedelic movements</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">originally had in them</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">and repurposed them or stripped them of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">that element</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">i also believe that in the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:16.720" style="s2">communities existing today</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">there is a strong right-wing element now</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">of course not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">in there is right wing and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">uh uh leans this way naturally i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:28.800" style="s2">sure it leans the psychedelic leans left</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">or right naturally</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.800" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">you do have a uh a thought that the le</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">that left leaning stuff is naturally</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">psychedelic or that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">the psychedelic is naturally</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">left-leaning with its</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">questions of authority and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">erasures of boundary that we already</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">touched on</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">um but it&#39;s not true um you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">spiritualism psychedelia transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">all have of course reactionary elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">within them</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">uh today we can see this in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:02.720" style="s2">psychedelic community through like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.600" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">organic unity or the return to nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.720" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">this kind of position of a lost man that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">needs to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:13.440" style="s2">connect back to something that was great</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">um i would fundamentally reject this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.440" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">you see the ideas of levels of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.120" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">that end up actually justifying</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.120" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">injustice</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">in the world so you know this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">through some kind of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">vibration or something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">actually inviting</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">suffering onto you so that when people</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">experience poverty they experience loss</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">something to do with their spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.240" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.519" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">and then also the ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">prominent in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">in the psychedelic communities of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">forces</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">which also which often leads to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">conspiracy uh thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">so the shadow forces obviously would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">um on the sides where you look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">ideas of the illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">or uh dark wizards</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">evil magic stuff like that um and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">leaning into</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">reptilian control theories uh which have</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:20.079" style="s2">their structural similarity</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">to anti-semitic theories running</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.079" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">throughout history sometimes being</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">why the acid left um well we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">inspired by fischer pretty heavily</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">that&#39;s what brought</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">terry tapp having these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">but we&#39;re not only inspired by mark</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:58.480" style="s2">explain and explore fisher only you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">mike and i both have our own influences</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:03.600" style="s2">uh that go beyond fisher and would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">our own critiques of fisher in various</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.600" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">portions so we didn&#39;t want to just say</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">we are create content under the name of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">acid communism you know we&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">acid communism we&#39;re creating content</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">that we think</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">is inspired by these ideas that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">fisher&#39;s work leaves and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">take up some of those questions and ask</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">some more of our own</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">um left because we i mean essentially we</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:33.760" style="s2">are leftists and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">but we&#39;re also trying to build that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.760" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">broader association there</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">that maybe the word communism in its uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">forthrightness can off can off-put</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">people though i</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">myself would consider myself a communist</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">so what we basically do is we produce</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">lots of memes</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:56.480" style="s2">which have a psychedelic aesthetic um or</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">some kind of boundary pushing or</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.480" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">boundary uh eliminating purpose we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">have created music in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">visuals to go along with the music we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">which interviews various people working</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">either in</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">some kind of left academia left</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">journalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">psychedelic writing or artist</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ve also been doing the beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">linguistics reading group</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">and in that we read theory or philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:33.680" style="s2">and then we interpret it as visual arts</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">memes or um some kind of music or poem</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.680" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">so in that you know we&#39;re like actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">transforming actively the theory that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">and trying to understand it in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:45.040" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">for someone who may not actually go</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.040" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">through and read those</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">dense texts sometimes um so that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">my little presentation and i do want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">play a song</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">uh we&#39;re gonna play a music video for it</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">this is called a serious</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">joke it samples heavily from</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">mark fisher&#39;s acid communist</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">so you know here we&#39;re really we just</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">tried to make it fun make it something</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:14.959" style="s2">that would be enjoyable to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">but also produces certain like sensory</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.959" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">feelings in the individual that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">engaging it i do want to stress again</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">and i honestly believe a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">that stuff really does come from traumas</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">from personal</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">and social trauma so i guess we would</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">really emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">social trauma um but</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:26.880" style="s2">addressing personal trauma is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.279" style="s2">important as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">um and building those bridges between</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.279" end="00:33:35.200" style="s2">people on an actual human level</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">is i mean if you can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.200" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">then you&#39;re really missing something</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">important that could lead to any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">social revolution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.279" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">yeah we have a upcoming event called the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">the trauma scene here about like uh like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">you know this is the epoch we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">uh contending with all this collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:55.120" style="s2">trauma</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:57.039" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s pivot we got some great</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.120" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">questions in the chat uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.039" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">andy you have a question</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">hi um i&#39;m wondering individually uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:08.240" style="s2">interpersonally um i look at the concept</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">of hauntology</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.240" end="00:34:14.320" style="s2">as being able to view the space</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">of something new and the only way you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.320" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">can do that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">is by trying to eliminate your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">unconscious biases</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">of let&#39;s say a capitalist framework of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">how things exist</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">exist now to how they could exist that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">kind of a second order</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">merging between whatever cop</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">communism capitalism socialism something</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">and so the question is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">skills</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">that we can use to minimize this</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:46.839" style="s2">unconscious capitalist cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">framework to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.839" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">ontologically</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s a great question now i</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">do have to say</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not super familiar i know a little</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">bit of fisher&#39;s work on hantology</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">but i think i can answer this as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">but maybe not quite um</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">in the ontological realm um</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">so i think a lot of those are listening</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">to people sharing stories</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">and really trying to understand between</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">well i get i guess this would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">intra-personal though um</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">trying to understand other people and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">expand yourself through them</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">um to know their stories to know their</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">um beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure uh how it really goes you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">know i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">often when people have these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">the the a psychedelic experience that</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">kind of switches you to a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:45.760" style="s2">reality tunnel like that it happens in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.760" end="00:35:49.680" style="s2">hard to quantify afterwards um you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">really say</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">what what made you have that epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">in those moments</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">so i&#39;m not sure how to individually</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">cultivate that we i mean we look at</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:09.760" style="s2">the you know the kind of forces and</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">pressures that are upon us and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:14.320" style="s2">interpolate from there</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:15.359" style="s2">i guess you could say trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.320" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.359" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">fischer talks about the uh trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">think about not what we are to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">but what capitalism is to us like for</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">the worker or the everyday person and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">you know thinking of it in ways of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:33.280" style="s2">what it has to obscure what it has to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">make sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.280" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen is collective joy</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">um you know so if we think of it in</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">that way and looking at what stops</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">collective joy</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">what stops collective flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">amongst yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">and amongst people um and then tracing</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s really getting into like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">social traumas</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">i would suppose and then also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">connect those social traumas</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">with your own personal trauma so</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:00.560" style="s2">connecting your</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">and then vice versa your personal</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.560" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">traumas when dealing with them seeing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">how they connect</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.000" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">to larger social traumas but i guess you</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">already have that idea or framework in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">um somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.680" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">andy any follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">no that&#39;s helpful um</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">i just defer to somebody else all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">uh evan you&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">hey so i really appreciated uh what</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:38.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve been uh saying and i really like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.240" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">aesthetic um so i guess i have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">question that i struggle with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">myself wanting to get your take on this</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">which is sort of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">between um you know more modern and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">and present uh expressions of of</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:55.680" style="s2">communism</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:57.280" style="s2">uh the tension between that and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.680" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">effectiveness of markets</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.280" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">so where i&#39;m going with this is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">markets seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">uh obviously superior mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">resource allocation</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">to the sort of top-down command</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:11.680" style="s2">economies</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">which were attempted to be implemented</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.680" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">by the uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">you know communist states of the past</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">and yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:19.680" style="s2">unfettered market capitalism obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">has all these terrible effects so i</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.680" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">think that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">you know the the communist uh analysis</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">is correct and that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.119" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">really really focused on the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">the uh of profit between say capital and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">labor we should be emphasizing the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:37.200" style="s2">importance of labor and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">conversation a lot more and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.200" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">totally with the communist program in</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:43.280" style="s2">but i also wonder what you think the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">relationship is like maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.280" end="00:38:46.960" style="s2">just kind of riff on like how do we take</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">the sort of optimization power</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.960" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">of the idea of a of a competitive market</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">and how do we you know um bind that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">that it is uh working in the service of</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">human flourishing human happiness</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.320" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">all that good stuff like like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.320" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">sort of confront that reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">21st century where we have such a</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">complicated world um and we need things</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">like markets to</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">optimize our resource chains um and yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">markets uh unfettered are so destructive</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">uh so just yeah if you could riff on</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">that for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">yeah um so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">i think you know i think like the us the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">austrian school kind of has this way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">viewing the market as like a computer or</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">um that does all those calculations</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">and yes compared to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">the you know like the soviet uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">economy it may be more</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">it has something that the soviet economy</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">absolutely or like or any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">ones but</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i would necessarily call</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">it more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">um i do think a big</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">portion of that maybe techno technology</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:03.440" style="s2">um so during those that time really the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">biggest problem i think they faced</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">was information they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">all of the information that they truly</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">needed if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:16.560" style="s2">make a planned uh economy like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">and part of that was because of their</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.560" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">strict political</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">um uh uh repression right so like</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">if if a farmer thinks that he might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">shot if he says the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">uh he&#39;s gonna give the answer like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">how much he can do how much he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:32.960" style="s2">produced he&#39;s gonna give whatever answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.960" end="00:40:38.880" style="s2">he thinks uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">the the soviet bureaucrat or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.880" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">wants to hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">um but then also just the peer</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">calculation at that time</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">i think today we really with computing</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:51.839" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">with artificial intelligence and various</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.839" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:57.440" style="s2">uh and cybernetics we really have that</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">ability to plan</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">a lot more uh than we did then so</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">you know one of the things that was one</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">chilean government was working on as</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">well was uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">the cybernetics with their um cybersin i</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">think they called it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:18.240" style="s2">this vast ability to compute and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">calculate the various needs</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.240" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">um and resources of the society</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">in not a top-down model but more of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:28.400" style="s2">distributed model</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">um you know uh different nodes</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">connecting and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">talking to each other you see that today</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">certain people um on like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:41.440" style="s2">accelerationist side or even</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">the marxist literary critic um</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.440" end="00:41:45.200" style="s2">frederick jameson has talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.200" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">nationalizing walmart and amazon because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">they basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">have most of that calculating</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">technology that would be required um</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">you know to do that kind of thing they</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:02.560" style="s2">have the infrastructure there</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just not there on the on the public</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">level serving</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">the public need uh then though to shift</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">from that</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:14.839" style="s2">a little bit some of it is redefining</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">what is good and what the goals are</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.839" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">so you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">a lot of this work comes uh is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">directly related to the ideas of luxury</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">communism</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">um which just like acid communism is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.720" end="00:42:30.720" style="s2">smashing together of words that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:32.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t normally associate with each</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.720" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">other and kind of forces you to change</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.480" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">your definition of each of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">uh so producing public luxuries</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">uh like something that everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.599" style="s2">you know public housing uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.920" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">infrastructures that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.599" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">absolutely beautiful and just for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">every person you know that&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">towards that would be vastly different</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">what we do now uh and trying to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">the working hours um trying to take away</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">toil from jobs uh from the labor that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">and making sure that labor is going</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.319" style="s2">towards something</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.920" style="s2">for the for everyone i think would</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.319" end="00:43:16.079" style="s2">automatically kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.920" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">the way those markets are functioning</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.079" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">because like so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">maybe um and i&#39;m also not for</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">strong super predictions like i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">think our goal should be</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.599" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">necessarily to lay out an exact</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">blueprint by any means</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">even though i am also saying we should</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:35.839" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:36.880" style="s2">inventing futures in a way so maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.839" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">markets to an extent do exist</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">but not for things that are seen as</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:50.480" style="s2">absolutely essential for life um</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">for you know social life and not just a</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.480" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">bare minimum life but an actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">beautiful life that everyone would enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">maybe markets become like a flea market</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">almost um you know you see that like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">people want to trade they want to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">commerce they want to create you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">artisanal goods or</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:12.240" style="s2">commodities on their own accord if</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.240" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">the point of life or the point of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">um then that&#39;s that&#39;s okay with me</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">personally like i don&#39;t care what those</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:23.920" style="s2">people do and maybe that would</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">kind of drive some of those while the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.920" end="00:44:27.359" style="s2">vast uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:28.400" style="s2">majority of stuff for everyone could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.359" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">produced in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.400" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">some kind of way that doesn&#39;t rely on</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:35.359" style="s2">markets like that but still takes in</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">all that information in a distributive</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">model where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">not top down but people are working</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">together and across the board</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:43.440" style="s2">they&#39;re probably a lot of this really</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">probably would rely on</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.440" end="00:44:47.520" style="s2">computing technology which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">necessarily my</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">forte i read about it but i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.680" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">programmer and i don&#39;t quite understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">it i have to ask my</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:56.960" style="s2">uh tech friends to explain it to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">quick follow-up if i may um so i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.800" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.200" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2">interested in this intersection that</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">you&#39;re describing between sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">emerging self-organizing organizational</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">um and knowledge structures uh which are</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">not top down</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">and using that sort of method or</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">perspective to reach the goal state</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">and um and so i&#39;m just wondering i&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">what&#39;s positive affects of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">capitalism or our current economic</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">system or even</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">our current social system would you like</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">to see brought forth and implemented in</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:56.160" style="s2">any</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">new system that comes forth of you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.160" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">the future of tomorrow you would want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">look like is there anything you would</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">bring forward that is currently being</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">practiced</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">uh yes i&#39;m sure there is you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to think though that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">interesting question um</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">i mean i think there&#39;s positive aspects</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">of course in the way that most marxists</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">would of it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">destroying of old forms of hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:25.599" style="s2">whatnot but i think you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">actual practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.599" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.000" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">uh what is a an actual so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">impart the uh the ability to have</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">separation between</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">work and and and life you know um</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">explored to how to make that positive</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">uh you know because so before</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.599" style="s2">in like a pre-capitalist society you</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">know your your life and your work</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.599" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">might be so completely tied up uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.280" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">that really those identities are hard to</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:06.079" style="s2">parse out and in capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">definitely parse that out though today</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.079" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">as we&#39;re entering um more of a society</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:15.040" style="s2">of control versus a society of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">discipline uh and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">all kind of have precarious job</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">employment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">and connected through uh smart</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">it seems like that erasure is happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">in a in a negative way um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s uh yeah i think that&#39;s all i</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">i could answer for that i&#39;m sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">more though um i would just have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">think on</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:43.359" style="s2">that exactly okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">yeah and i guess just another way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.359" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">phrasing my question would be is there a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">baby that you don&#39;t want to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">with the bath water</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">um well i i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">democracy as such even though i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">think it&#39;s necessarily tied</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">to capitalism by any means um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">with what you could argue with like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">china uh where it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">seems to be some kind of strange form of</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:12.240" style="s2">authoritarian state capitalism to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">um but you know democracy and that idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.240" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">liberty fraternity regardless</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">um equality like those</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">those are tied to liberalism um as such</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">so maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">capitalism but they&#39;ve been associated</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">with it for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">and you know certainly</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">the right or someone who considers</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">capitalism a positive thing would</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">consider those part of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:43.520" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">uh referring to uh during cold war era</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.520" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">for say like</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">um the authoritarian non-democratic</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:54.160" style="s2">communist states versus the western</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">nice liberal democratic states um so i</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.160" end="00:50:59.720" style="s2">think you do need to carry that on and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:03.160" style="s2">carry on a strong form of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.720" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">anti-authoritarianism and uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.160" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">libertarianism in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">in the small l sense not the american</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">libertarian party</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">to carry those kind of attitudes from</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:17.839" style="s2">and you know maybe finally realize the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:23.520" style="s2">uh capitalism promises this um</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:26.000" style="s2">entrepreneurial spirit this meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.520" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">uh and i think that&#39;s i would say i mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.000" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty on its face been proven to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">not be true</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">uh even as meritocracy was actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">coined as a word to make fun</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:38.960" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a satirical word it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:40.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of uh saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.960" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a merit but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.559" end="00:51:44.800" style="s2">like in the meritocracy you know they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">um but maybe from there to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">not carry those things on but finally</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">realize them</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:57.280" style="s2">to move beyond them and pass them um</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:58.079" style="s2">and like actually give that promise that</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:01.040" style="s2">claims it has</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:11.599" style="s2">tarn you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">hey um so my question was um</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.599" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">could we have a redistributive</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:18.319" style="s2">distributed model that looks outside</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">of the left right political binary um</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.319" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">and i was just thinking how fisher talks</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">um psychedelics being a root to helping</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:25.520" style="s2">us imagine something new but</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:28.000" style="s2">part of me thinks that this left right</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.520" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">binary is or is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.000" end="00:52:31.440" style="s2">something new and</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">i wonder if we can kind of think about</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.440" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">the political spectrum rather than with</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">um yeah i guess you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">there i think it comes down to what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">mean by left and right</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">um and a lot of people have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.120" style="s2">different things i think</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">i i&#39;m operating from</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.120" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">a vague notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">the left is more prone to looking at</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:02.880" style="s2">systemic</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">uh causes systemic to looking at</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:11.040" style="s2">as systemic rather than individual</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">um so and i think that is important to</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.040" end="00:53:13.839" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">look at so even in the stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.839" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">talking about so if we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">individual trauma</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also important to connect it to the</p>

<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">and i i wouldn&#39;t want to give that up</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">uh fisher would either because i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.319" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">not only about like this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">acid left that we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:39.119" style="s2">our goal isn&#39;t only to bring those</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">positive moments positive aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.119" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">psychedelic culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">to the left or broadly</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:48.400" style="s2">political uh awareness in general but</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">also to bring elements</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.400" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">of like class consciousness into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">uh community so i do think for our</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">project at least it is important</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">to identify with the left uh rather than</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">a political stance because we do bring</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:07.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">class you know a class analysis to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.200" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">pretty strongly so and so to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">that like briefly uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">illustration of the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">looking at it systemically versus</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">individually um</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">so that difference between left and</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">right there i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">summed up in that phrase what is it the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">uh anti-semitism</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">is the socialism of fools so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">whereas like the class analysis would</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:39.680" style="s2">look at this as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:42.400" style="s2">large societal systemic structural issue</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.680" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">you know you could also frame those same</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.400" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">things pointing to a lot of the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:52.400" style="s2">as bad actors um disrupting the system</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">you know rather than the system itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.400" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">producing</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.200" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">certain behaviors certain outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">acting upon</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">individuals uh so i mean i hope that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">answers that like</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:05.280" style="s2">like i said i do i do think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:08.319" style="s2">strong need to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.280" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">look at both the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.319" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">the bigger you know the whole but</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.760" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">i think we&#39;re focusing definitely on</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">looking at those structural sides and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">trying to allow the individual to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">recognize you know parts of them that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:24.559" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">uh predetermined the the the forces that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.559" end="00:55:30.079" style="s2">are shaping their unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">and their desires and producing um</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.079" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">all that what they&#39;re acting within</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">right uh i think sam&#39;s question uh is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">good fall to this sam</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">if you can unmute yourself and ask a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:49.839" style="s2">uh sure so yeah i i</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:52.880" style="s2">appreciated what you were mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.839" end="00:55:55.440" style="s2">about the rise of the alt-right and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">uh kind of tapping into these libidinal</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.440" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">energies that were being</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">uh loosed by them and how there is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">of energy in that but</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">i think that in recent years as things</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:07.280" style="s2">have progressed given our current</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:08.319" style="s2">media landscape um the incentives that</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.280" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">are driving it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.319" end="00:56:13.520" style="s2">it seems like a very similar um</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">tapping into libidinal energy is</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">happening on all corners of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">in ways that are kind of creating a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:25.440" style="s2">of fragmentation and decoherence</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">i&#39;m curious given the current</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.440" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">landscape that we&#39;re navigating and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">you were talking about about using memes</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.359" style="s2">and wanting to tap into that what a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">strategic way of doing that would look</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.359" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">like to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:39.680" style="s2">tap into those uh pervasive energies</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">and canalize them or direct them in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.680" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">way that would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">less destructive but also effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.640" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">given what we&#39;re dealing with these days</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">with with the media ecology</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">um interesting yeah i like that question</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">so effective i don&#39;t know you know um</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">i wish i could answer that if i could</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">i&#39;d you know we&#39;d probably have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">reach if we just had that formula for</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:07.599" style="s2">what is effective</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.599" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">younger and younger people enter the</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">really intense stuff and becoming</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.559" end="00:58:12.079" style="s2">tapping into those libidinal energies is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">all over</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.079" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">i worry though um</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.680" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">in some of the ways that a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">is almost like</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">frying out people&#39;s uh nervous system in</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">a way though</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">and not you know uh not helpful not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">healing</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">not uh like you were saying so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">yeah how do we actually direct that</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">i guess that&#39;s by the content that you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">know you&#39;re choosing to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">um and there&#39;s always a give and take</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.079" style="s2">there too like</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">the more you enter</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.079" end="00:58:51.200" style="s2">the already existing meme world the more</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:53.280" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.200" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">taking from memes that are currently out</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">there uh you know you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">sacrificing a part of whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">trying to cohere</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">around you&#39;re giving yourself to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">but then also something to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:10.079" style="s2">is social media memes</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:13.359" style="s2">all of this often relies on hate uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.079" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">you know i can say from experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.359" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">our our memes that get the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">attention are ones that early on people</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">disagree with um so</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:26.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s hard to avoid because like</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">part of me you know wants to be like</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.160" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">oh i hope someone gets mad at this like</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">you know they say oh you&#39;re not a true</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">communist or</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.280" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">you have no idea what the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">community is you know we get both of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:37.839" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">and whenever that happens you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.839" end="00:59:41.280" style="s2">like almost guaranteed that oh this</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">meme&#39;s gonna go far</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.280" end="00:59:46.559" style="s2">because you know we&#39;re engaged in these</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:48.799" style="s2">things and we&#39;re kind of in these</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.559" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">feedback dopamine feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.799" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">and people are getting mad and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:56.480" style="s2">it they&#39;re getting mad and arguing</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">so i guess within that space you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.480" end="00:59:59.119" style="s2">you can also redirect it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">just about</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">posting the meme especially if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">like a content creator and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">just sharing</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:07.119" style="s2">uh memes but maybe it goes even if</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">you&#39;re just sharing other memes you come</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.119" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.839" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to engage in that with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">people that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:14.559" style="s2">are talking to you you know the meme is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:16.799" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.559" end="01:00:19.359" style="s2">a gateway it&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.799" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">hyperbolic it&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.359" end="01:00:25.760" style="s2">you know over the top and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">maybe two on the nose uh overly</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:30.480" style="s2">metaphorical</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">you know so like in our in our um</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.480" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">podcast we we of course touch on like</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:35.680" style="s2">psychedelics like lsd and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.680" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">but we also spend more time exploring</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">these ideas other ideas that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">strictly drug-related uh psychedelia</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">yet in memes it&#39;s so much easier to</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">connect these ideas with these like</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">symbolic or metaphorical things so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">know it&#39;s so much easier to go</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">into something hyperbolic like throwing</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">magic mushrooms</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">uh and a copy of das capitol on</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:04.640" style="s2">a sandwich be like oh look it&#39;s an acid</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">communist breakfast</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.640" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">um you know that&#39;s gonna get people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">libidinal</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">energies uh caught in there and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">gonna draw attention</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:16.160" style="s2">but you risk a lot there and you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:18.720" style="s2">you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.160" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">building a community within that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.720" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">engaging</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:24.799" style="s2">both the love and the hate that anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">you&#39;re creating is getting</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.799" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">if you want to cohere it at all or you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">can like just try to throw</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">wrenches in the system but i think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">is actually dangerous to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">simply throw wrenches and uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">kind of hope that when it&#39;s falling</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:42.400" style="s2">apart you can dodge the pieces</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.359" end="01:01:48.079" style="s2">awesome uh so uh i&#39;m gonna skip some</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.880" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">follow-up questions just so we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.079" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">squeeze in</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:52.079" style="s2">um all the questions uh there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:54.240" style="s2">really good ones</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:56.799" style="s2">uh kale can you uh unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.240" end="01:01:56.799" style="s2">go next</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">sure thing actually i feel like that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">a pretty good follow-up to that one just</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:05.760" style="s2">because the idea of like um</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:07.520" style="s2">i fall into that trap of sharing the</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.760" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">memes just because i&#39;m trying to trigger</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.520" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">people you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:13.119" style="s2">getting the angry comments is always uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">somewhat uh gratifying but i guess</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.119" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that i&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">witnessed with this</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">kind of leftist meme sharing is it</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">almost kind of starts to winnow itself</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">down into these weird micro groups</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">and i guess um that&#39;s just kind of my</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">question i kind of tried how do we make</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">sure that we don&#39;t just kind of explore</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">inward and get more and more insular</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">and try to actually use it as a form of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">connection kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:35.599" style="s2">just because i feel like that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:37.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the trap when i talk about my</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.599" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">hippie friends is kind of people miss</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">the point once they feel that connection</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">or whatever right then that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">almost elevates their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">importance rather than realizing oh we</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">all have this we all</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:49.920" style="s2">kind of can work on this together kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">of thing i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.920" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">i&#39;m terrible at verbalizing it but</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:02:59.359" style="s2">no uh i mean i i get what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.640" end="01:03:01.839" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.359" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">absolutely right um that seems actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.839" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s like a big theme of these</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">questions which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">great because that&#39;s a question we have</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:11.760" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">um you know i wish i had strong answers</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.760" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">for these</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:16.640" style="s2">um but i think that&#39;s something that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.559" style="s2">have to kind of come up with</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.640" end="01:03:21.039" style="s2">together and that&#39;s what we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.559" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">for so</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.039" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">moving beyond of course like like you</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:27.280" style="s2">know we were definitely</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">guilty of it some of our memes or some</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.280" end="01:03:32.000" style="s2">of the things we say</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">might be too heavily laced with irony or</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.000" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">satirism</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">but moving into like actual moments of</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">sincerity</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">um trying to connect with other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:42.839" style="s2">and trying to show</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">a softness trying to show an</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.839" end="01:03:48.160" style="s2">understanding of other</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">excuse me um of others you know and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.160" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right it kind of goes</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">like with you said your hippie friends</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">how an enlightening experience can</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.119" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">actually lead someone to become</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">more narcissistic uh in some ways and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">yeah you have to fight against that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:07.520" style="s2">you know that happens in political</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:10.240" style="s2">movements too it&#39;s almost uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.520" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">the same way you see uh we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.240" end="01:04:13.440" style="s2">the history of the left</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">and see that the history of the left in</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.440" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">the states um</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">and the constant fracturing of</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.280" style="s2">uh little parties into micro sects that</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:23.280" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.280" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">basically cults you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.280" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">kind of secular cult um</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">and you want to avoid doing that so i</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">sharing creating and sharing things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">really focus on a collective joy</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:38.960" style="s2">um something i keep coming back to is</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">part of that you know like</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.960" end="01:04:43.760" style="s2">so really trying to make those things</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.119" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">fun memes are one thing but</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.760" end="01:04:51.039" style="s2">music uh music is a really easy thing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">collectively experience together and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.039" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">pulls you both out of like whatever time</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">that you&#39;re in and put you in something</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:01.599" style="s2">there so if you can infuse</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:02.720" style="s2">music with those kinds of intentions and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.599" end="01:05:05.280" style="s2">messages</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.720" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">that&#39;s something you know that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.280" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">strong and you can make it fun</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">to listen to so that these things appeal</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:14.880" style="s2">not just to people who are in the know</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:16.960" style="s2">right like if you&#39;re only talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.880" end="01:05:18.559" style="s2">to a small circle you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.960" end="01:05:19.359" style="s2">anything and you&#39;re not expanding</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.559" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.359" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">um in order to expand any other circle</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:25.680" style="s2">or group</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:26.960" style="s2">you yourself have to expand and you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.680" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.960" end="01:05:32.799" style="s2">envision your you and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:33.440" style="s2">them you know the the us and them</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.799" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.440" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">collectively experiencing something as</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:39.280" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:41.440" style="s2">um so yeah i guess that&#39;s my my answer</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.280" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">is really trying to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.440" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">actual collective joy and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">and good times um without without saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">good vibes man because</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:54.559" style="s2">that&#39;s not what i&#39;m saying either but</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">like really actually um</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.559" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">the collective part i guess is important</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:06:01.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">yeah i like that serious serious play</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.839" end="01:06:05.440" style="s2">um so let&#39;s end with a question from</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">kevin</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.440" end="01:06:08.720" style="s2">about uh i like what you&#39;re saying about</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.720" end="01:06:12.799" style="s2">tutorial thing kevin if you can ask that</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.799" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">yeah um so this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:20.720" style="s2">taps into what you were just saying with</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">like building a collective joy</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.720" end="01:06:24.000" style="s2">and like building a community um on your</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.039" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">youtube channel</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.000" end="01:06:28.400" style="s2">you have a photoshop tutorial it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">like how to make a joe biden doomer meme</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.400" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">and i&#39;ve never really seen like</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">political channels like explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:36.160" style="s2">making tutorial videos like</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.720" end="01:06:37.920" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve never seen like a conjurer</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.160" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">points how to do a makeup video or</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.920" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">but um i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">so like what the relationship is between</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:47.599" style="s2">sort of educating people and making</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">these memes</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.599" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">and the ideology of say acid leftism</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">and like what you well first of all i</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:06:56.799" style="s2">hope that you keep making the tutorials</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:06:58.559" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.799" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">your aesthetic is incredible and very</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.559" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">visually complex and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">the sounds too so um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">that and i&#39;m wondering like what if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:08.319" style="s2">can sort of talk about</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">if you plan on doing that and what the</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.319" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">motivation and ideology surrounding that</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:14.720" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:16.319" style="s2">yeah absolutely thank you um i do have</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.720" end="01:07:19.760" style="s2">to say though i think if</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.319" end="01:07:23.440" style="s2">if natalie did a makeup tutorial video</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.760" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">it would break the internet i think like</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:28.000" style="s2">i mean we need that you know i i need</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:31.280" style="s2">her to show me how to contour because</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:16.239" style="s2">the point is to engage and create</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:17.359" style="s2">community to show people how easy some</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.239" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">of this stuff can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.359" end="01:08:21.679" style="s2">to give them ideas um to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">democratize the process</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.679" end="01:08:28.000" style="s2">itself um you know because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.679" end="01:08:29.120" style="s2">we you don&#39;t want if you&#39;re working in</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.000" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">this kind of project</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.120" end="01:08:33.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to simply be giving</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.600" end="01:08:35.839" style="s2">people content but you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.839" end="01:08:36.960" style="s2">you know be giving them the tools to</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.839" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">create content</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.960" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">you want um to create content that</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:44.560" style="s2">furthers their own understanding</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:46.480" style="s2">you know um i i truly believe no</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.560" end="01:08:48.159" style="s2">not all of the stuff would fit into this</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.480" end="01:08:50.319" style="s2">but i truly believe if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.159" end="01:08:52.400" style="s2">making a great image and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.319" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">connecting a quote uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.400" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">with a relative juxtaposition of image</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:58.560" style="s2">that that can connect something in your</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:02.159" style="s2">mind you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.560" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">and help you understand that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.159" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">the concept or like the the um</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:11.040" style="s2">topography of that concept</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:13.839" style="s2">in a way much deeper than you would</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.040" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">just simply by reading it um and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.839" end="01:09:16.159" style="s2">know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:18.560" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s part of way my mind works i</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.159" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">often visualize stuff that i&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.560" end="01:09:22.159" style="s2">or um in almost like collage collage</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">fashion</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.159" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">uh so yeah that i think that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">thing to do and you know that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.239" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">like the reading groups and stuff as</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:32.480" style="s2">well it</p>
