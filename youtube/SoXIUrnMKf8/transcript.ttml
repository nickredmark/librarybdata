<p begin="00:00:04.370" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">little bit about why capitalism is not</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.020" end="00:00:14.429" style="s2">the answer to our problems it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:18.480" style="s2">causing most of the problems but to me</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.429" end="00:00:21.600" style="s2">the inefficiency of if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">solution either a better product than</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.600" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">what&#39;s out there or a brand new product</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.279" end="00:00:30.779" style="s2">or service there are so many steps you</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:32.550" style="s2">have to follow in order to allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.779" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">be the solution so it&#39;s actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.550" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">market when it&#39;s just an idea in your</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:39.510" style="s2">head it&#39;s not helping anyone so not only</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">do you have to come up with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.510" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">which is probably the easy part</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">you then have to either be the person</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">who can actually create it in my case I</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:50.730" style="s2">have a lot of ideas for technology but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:52.980" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to code and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:55.649" style="s2">learn it and my brain will not learn</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.980" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">coding so there&#39;s ways around that of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.649" end="00:00:58.530" style="s2">course you can outsource it I can pay</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:00.980" style="s2">someone to make an app which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.530" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">planning on doing for my first project</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.980" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">but just like you either need to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:09.450" style="s2">the skill to be able to make it or have</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.700" style="s2">the resources to be able to to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">it and then you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.700" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">market it and then it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">point in the system where you figure out</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:22.140" style="s2">if it&#39;s actually feasible if people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">going if it&#39;s gonna resonate with people</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.140" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">and that process works okay for some</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">people the type-a personalities and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">entrepreneurial types who love risk and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">love but and if that was the only</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">problem the only issue on the planet was</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">that it didn&#39;t have enough money like me</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:48.810" style="s2">personally do not know money then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.990" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">I could fight and do that but figuring</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.810" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">out but I don&#39;t if like if I just had an</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">idea for a better mousetrap and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">world didn&#39;t need that answer it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:03.719" style="s2">just about making myself more money then</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">yeah that system works for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.719" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">group of people but what about the rest</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:12.750" style="s2">of us what about people who have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:17.330" style="s2">to save the planet new energy systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.750" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">and new ways of combating disease and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.330" end="00:02:21.300" style="s2">not only do they have to go through that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:24.600" style="s2">process they&#39;re already doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.300" end="00:02:30.780" style="s2">world where it&#39;s against them where you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.600" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">have to mark it possibly in a market</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.780" end="00:02:36.360" style="s2">that isn&#39;t that&#39;s already saturated so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:38.820" style="s2">even if you have an amazing brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.360" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">idea if it&#39;s for a car chances of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.820" end="00:02:41.760" style="s2">getting it made and getting it be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">successful because in order to start a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.760" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">car company would need tens of billions</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:49.050" style="s2">of dollars and it&#39;s really hard to break</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:52.290" style="s2">into that market when people spend</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.050" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">millions of dollars on advertising the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.290" end="00:02:58.830" style="s2">big car companies so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:01.650" style="s2">to me the global cooperative is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.830" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">solution is I want the system in place</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.650" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">to be able to go online and give my idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">offer it to the world and have people</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.540" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">comment on it and critique it and have</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:16.769" style="s2">it there&#39;s so much that that offers one</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.620" style="s2">you get to find out a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.769" end="00:03:23.010" style="s2">problems and issues the potential users</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.620" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">would have before it&#39;s ever made to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.010" end="00:03:31.650" style="s2">have that&#39;s not number these you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:33.269" style="s2">need to be the personality Taiyo table</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.650" end="00:03:35.940" style="s2">to make it because the chance of being</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.269" end="00:03:37.380" style="s2">both of those people is smaller than</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.940" end="00:03:41.220" style="s2">just needing one of those that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.380" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">the people who will know the steps to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">take there are people who would love</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">every step along that process so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">one person loved all the steps but like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.190" end="00:03:52.380" style="s2">someone loves marketing and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:57.290" style="s2">loves running the data and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.380" end="00:03:59.549" style="s2">the analysis people love coding so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.290" end="00:04:01.650" style="s2">allowing people to give what they want</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.549" end="00:04:02.940" style="s2">to give and not have to be all things at</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.650" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">once in order to be I mean in order to</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.940" end="00:04:09.530" style="s2">be the CEO or the start of a company the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">person who starts a company sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.530" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">need to be a jack-of-all-trades you need</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:16.530" style="s2">to know how to market to do HR to do all</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.280" end="00:04:19.799" style="s2">of that and where you don&#39;t know if your</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.530" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">business fails and a lot of obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.799" end="00:04:25.349" style="s2">come up I&#39;ve seen it happen with many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:26.290" style="s2">my friends and family and so being able</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.349" end="00:04:30.940" style="s2">to offer that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.290" end="00:04:33.670" style="s2">system that helps us to go from idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.940" end="00:04:35.980" style="s2">through to either no this isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.670" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">work or like wow what an amazing product</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.980" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">maybe in between figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.400" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">together I just think there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:45.760" style="s2">power there and then when you&#39;re you own</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:47.140" style="s2">it together so you&#39;re not one person</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.760" end="00:04:49.620" style="s2">taking on all the risk because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.140" end="00:04:51.910" style="s2">people like me who are risk adverse I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.620" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">would stress me out if I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.910" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">where my next paycheck was coming on</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">from and I have issues with be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.510" end="00:05:02.050" style="s2">make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:03.610" style="s2">I concede this infinite world in front</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:06.250" style="s2">of me and all the different ways to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.610" end="00:05:07.420" style="s2">something I need other people who maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.250" end="00:05:08.950" style="s2">don&#39;t have that vision of the big</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.420" end="00:05:11.710" style="s2">picture but do you have the vision of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.950" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">life like our more decisive than big</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.710" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">things so I think where we fall short in</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">skills other people can pick it up we</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:20.710" style="s2">can spread the reward and risk oh well</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:23.230" style="s2">maybe there isn&#39;t really like the reward</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">is in using the product in service in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.230" end="00:05:27.490" style="s2">using what we created together because</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">it&#39;s a solution that&#39;s the reward for</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.490" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">the user and you&#39;re spreading the risk</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:32.260" style="s2">oh you&#39;re not one person putting in ten</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">million dollars to see if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.260" end="00:05:35.800" style="s2">make it big that system exists it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">capitalism if you want have an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.800" end="00:05:38.950" style="s2">you think is gonna make it there go</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.600" style="s2">ahead and make it there but if you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.950" end="00:05:42.730" style="s2">an idea that you just want a gift to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.600" end="00:05:45.100" style="s2">world you want to have the world make</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.730" end="00:05:47.470" style="s2">better and create together and you want</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.100" end="00:05:50.260" style="s2">us all to own it I want there to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.470" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">space online for us to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.260" end="00:05:53.260" style="s2">that&#39;s what the global cooperative is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:54.970" style="s2">gonna be it&#39;s gonna be one of probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.260" end="00:05:57.130" style="s2">not the first project maybe not even the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.970" end="00:06:00.280" style="s2">first couple as we work through a system</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.130" end="00:06:03.400" style="s2">to create together but very soon on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.280" end="00:06:05.980" style="s2">be able to have a online hub to go on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.400" end="00:06:09.220" style="s2">and offer suggestions to improve</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.980" end="00:06:11.250" style="s2">existing technology as well as create</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.220" end="00:06:15.100" style="s2">brand new technology and working through</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.250" end="00:06:17.110" style="s2">that whole process together and being</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.100" end="00:06:20.440" style="s2">able to lift each other up where we fall</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.110" end="00:06:22.630" style="s2">short and I think I want that assistant</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.440" end="00:06:26.100" style="s2">to exist and hopefully other people can</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.630" end="00:06:26.100" style="s2">see the beauty - thank you</p>
