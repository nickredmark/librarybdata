<p begin="00:03:00.890" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">right there&#39;s a history in the UK that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:08.780" style="s2">seeps through just to at least my raw</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:11.270" style="s2">experience as I as I walk around places</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.780" end="00:03:13.100" style="s2">and I&#39;m very attached to that mystique</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.270" end="00:03:15.860" style="s2">and there&#39;s something as well about</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.100" end="00:03:17.989" style="s2">about being on the edge here you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.860" end="00:03:20.090" style="s2">mmm it&#39;s slightly it&#39;s a fossa it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:03:20.090" end="00:03:24.170" style="s2">absolutely attached to civilization but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.040" end="00:03:27.110" style="s2">there is you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.170" end="00:03:28.820" style="s2">nice metaphoric analogy there to that to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.110" end="00:03:30.290" style="s2">the world of thought as well yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.820" end="00:03:32.780" style="s2">know you can be out here walking the</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.410" end="00:03:49.070" style="s2">really why you why you&#39;re here in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.540" end="00:03:51.320" style="s2">some ways and it&#39;s on the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.070" end="00:03:52.520" style="s2">Britain you know yeah a bit like some my</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.320" end="00:03:54.410" style="s2">thought you know I&#39;m sort of just</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.940" end="00:04:00.470" style="s2">the edge but for for my part at least</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.220" end="00:04:03.380" style="s2">it&#39;s an edge that I am very interested</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.470" end="00:04:05.300" style="s2">in continuing to explore with you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.380" end="00:04:07.970" style="s2">definitely been a big influence on me</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.350" end="00:04:28.490" style="s2">was published at the end of 2013 so is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.300" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">that when you put the website up around</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.490" end="00:04:31.190" style="s2">there sounds about right</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:33.950" style="s2">I remember well I found it I found it</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.190" end="00:04:36.860" style="s2">very early at 2014 alright pretty early</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.950" end="00:04:38.330" style="s2">on and part of that is because oh it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.860" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">seems that you and I share a great many</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.330" end="00:04:43.700" style="s2">interest from from philosophy very</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:46.580" style="s2">broadly into psychedelics to authors</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.700" end="00:04:49.220" style="s2">like Nietzsche yeah in in my case now</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.580" end="00:04:51.260" style="s2">I&#39;m a young and I know you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.220" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">summary of young on online so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.260" end="00:04:55.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve have spent some time yet I taught</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">a little bit of young up at College in</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.760" end="00:05:00.650" style="s2">London yeah not too much there yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:03.790" style="s2">also pan psychism as well and process</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.650" end="00:05:06.980" style="s2">philosophy perhaps most acutely and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.790" end="00:05:09.800" style="s2">well you know I have a few I I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.980" end="00:05:12.350" style="s2">deep down I have a few aims for for this</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.800" end="00:05:17.300" style="s2">discussion and part of that is to get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.350" end="00:05:20.260" style="s2">bit closer to how someone&#39;s philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.300" end="00:05:23.450" style="s2">let&#39;s just call it how their pursue in</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.260" end="00:05:27.740" style="s2">you know in caking on and wending their</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.450" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">way and trying to bring sets of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.740" end="00:05:33.650" style="s2">together into some sort of whole that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">then relatable till to one&#39;s life in</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.650" end="00:05:38.840" style="s2">some sense how that process is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.560" end="00:05:40.820" style="s2">fundamentally the why are you doing what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.840" end="00:05:43.300" style="s2">you do because it in it in a way for me</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.820" end="00:05:45.320" style="s2">at least this this whole all of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.300" end="00:05:47.300" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.320" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m choosing to do it in in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.300" end="00:05:50.949" style="s2">very real sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:52.900" style="s2">but at the same time sitting here with</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.949" end="00:05:54.550" style="s2">you right now is unnecessary it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.900" end="00:05:56.289" style="s2">necessary endeavor I&#39;ve been you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.550" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">there is a certain questioning process</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.289" end="00:06:01.599" style="s2">and and journey itself towards at the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:03.069" style="s2">very basic level trying to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.599" end="00:06:05.740" style="s2">things whatever we might mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.069" end="00:06:08.759" style="s2">and and that&#39;s led you to entertain what</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.740" end="00:06:12.789" style="s2">I consider to be a really cutting edge</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.759" end="00:06:14.650" style="s2">interpretation of a way of viewing</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.789" end="00:06:17.530" style="s2">reality itself from our very limited</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.650" end="00:06:19.629" style="s2">human perspective that is in accord with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.530" end="00:06:22.539" style="s2">much of the great thinking of our past</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.629" end="00:06:24.729" style="s2">yet at the same time is very</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.539" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">fundamentally opposed to what might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.729" end="00:06:29.860" style="s2">considered philosophical orthodoxy as</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:31.719" style="s2">per the academic institutions of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.860" end="00:06:33.669" style="s2">time so perhaps you know giving you a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.719" end="00:06:36.189" style="s2">very broad Launchpad there we have view</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.669" end="00:06:38.529" style="s2">the individual it was somehow found his</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.189" end="00:06:40.169" style="s2">way to exploring these ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.529" end="00:06:42.490" style="s2">where that actually meets the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.169" end="00:06:44.919" style="s2">technicalities of how those views come</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.490" end="00:06:46.569" style="s2">out looking on page so I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.919" end="00:06:48.759" style="s2">don&#39;t know well okay as well as I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.569" end="00:06:50.229" style="s2">say this um we were speaking about when</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.759" end="00:06:51.219" style="s2">we were at the lighthouse earlier we</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.229" end="00:06:54.159" style="s2">were speaking about Nietzsche&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.219" end="00:06:55.930" style="s2">power a nature of course reduces the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.159" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">will to truth to the world power you</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.930" end="00:07:00.339" style="s2">know knowledge of power spoken said but</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.229" style="s2">I think like Whitehead and others there</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.339" end="00:07:04.360" style="s2">is actually another drive for knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.229" end="00:07:06.490" style="s2">you know separate somehow from power</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.360" end="00:07:09.219" style="s2">even if it&#39;s detrimental to one&#39;s power</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.490" end="00:07:11.560" style="s2">there is some kind of drive curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.219" end="00:07:13.960" style="s2">which is somehow natural perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.560" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">probably not just to humans but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.960" end="00:07:18.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve certainly been afflicted for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.529" style="s2">drive from them I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.430" end="00:07:22.689" style="s2">started my father who was an artist</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.529" end="00:07:24.189" style="s2">painter he was always interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.689" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">philosophy and he had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.189" end="00:07:29.110" style="s2">philosophy books and in our house I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:31.839" style="s2">one especially East and Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.110" end="00:07:34.900" style="s2">philosophy that got me yeah that started</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.839" end="00:07:37.060" style="s2">me probably and and I so I decided to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.900" end="00:07:38.919" style="s2">study philosophy I thought that was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.060" end="00:07:40.419" style="s2">broadest most comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.919" end="00:07:42.009" style="s2">route to truth science would have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.419" end="00:07:43.150" style="s2">second mmm-hmm but of course that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.009" end="00:07:46.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t deal with certain things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.150" end="00:07:48.099" style="s2">ethics and consciousness and so on at</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.839" end="00:07:50.889" style="s2">least not very well why we should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.099" end="00:07:52.569" style="s2">living at all right so it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.889" end="00:07:55.089" style="s2">so I was seeing science as a method</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.569" end="00:07:57.430" style="s2">rather than write knowledge really of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.089" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">of course meaning adds to knowledge but</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.430" end="00:08:01.270" style="s2">anyway so I chose sedative philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:02.350" style="s2">got into Nietzsche very early on and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.270" end="00:08:04.780" style="s2">that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.350" end="00:08:07.030" style="s2">immediately changed my whole ethical</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.780" end="00:08:08.320" style="s2">outlook you know upturned it really and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.030" end="00:08:13.210" style="s2">that&#39;s always stayed with me when</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.320" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">Nietzsche 18 I was too young got me too</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.210" end="00:08:16.540" style="s2">young</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">yeah why does why does Nietzsche so is</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.540" end="00:08:22.330" style="s2">so often referenced as the sledgehammer</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:23.410" style="s2">which could happen to philosophers with</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.330" end="00:08:26.530" style="s2">a hammer as he&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.410" end="00:08:28.420" style="s2">why because I suppose ultimately it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.530" end="00:08:31.420" style="s2">like every good philosopher should it</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.420" end="00:08:33.130" style="s2">just hammers down your assumptions you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.420" end="00:08:35.169" style="s2">know the axioms that you never even</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.130" end="00:08:36.310" style="s2">questioned so you know before Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.169" end="00:08:37.780" style="s2">I was thinking about ethics and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.310" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">thought well how does one ground ethics</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.780" end="00:08:43.030" style="s2">is it in compassion is it about quality</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:45.010" style="s2">is it the universe or the other nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.030" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">makes one question why one even wants to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.010" end="00:08:50.260" style="s2">do that he takes a person back to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:53.530" style="s2">history of the ethics of the West and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:55.210" style="s2">presents motives for why people purport</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.530" end="00:08:56.950" style="s2">this kind of Morales here so just at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.210" end="00:08:58.570" style="s2">very least a makes you question it you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.950" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">know even if you disagree with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.570" end="00:09:02.710" style="s2">it suddenly puts it all up in the air so</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">that changes you immediately and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.710" end="00:09:06.850" style="s2">Nietzsche I mean I was came very</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:08.860" style="s2">interested in a central tenet of his you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.850" end="00:09:09.820" style="s2">know the world&#39;s power later turn out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.860" end="00:09:12.370" style="s2">his really although it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.820" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">throughout his work but he expressly</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.370" end="00:09:15.850" style="s2">talks about the will to power minutes</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:19.060" style="s2">later notebooks and later works publish</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.850" end="00:09:21.190" style="s2">works and my theory as I mentioned is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.060" end="00:09:22.960" style="s2">that I you believe that his theory of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.190" end="00:09:24.580" style="s2">the world&#39;s power is incomplete yes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.960" end="00:09:25.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why the most interesting stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.580" end="00:09:27.370" style="s2">in the notebooks rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.630" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">published works but you know in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.370" end="00:09:30.970" style="s2">notebooks and in the published works he</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:33.190" style="s2">talks about there was power having an</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.970" end="00:09:36.310" style="s2">effect form rights and an affectation</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.190" end="00:09:38.470" style="s2">yes sort of form of sentience going back</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.310" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">to shop and how somewhat and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.470" end="00:09:41.710" style="s2">really what then started me off thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:44.350" style="s2">about pants psychism you know the view</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.710" end="00:09:46.600" style="s2">that mentality is in all things not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.350" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">an emergent property of brains and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.600" end="00:09:50.470" style="s2">that was sort of substantiate it when I</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">looked at shopping our after nature in</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.470" end="00:09:53.850" style="s2">Kent</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:56.530" style="s2">he&#39;s the bridge between them and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.850" end="00:09:57.850" style="s2">university also studied Bergson under</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.530" end="00:09:59.770" style="s2">Keith Ansel Pearson who&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.850" end="00:10:01.210" style="s2">Nietzschean that pushed it further and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.770" end="00:10:02.440" style="s2">then I realized that the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.210" end="00:10:04.810" style="s2">culmination of all these thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.440" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">perhaps was from what I understood at</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.810" end="00:10:08.260" style="s2">the time from secondary reading was</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.300" style="s2">Alfred North Whitehead then you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.260" end="00:10:12.940" style="s2">number of years ago I got into his work</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.300" end="00:10:15.340" style="s2">which is the sort of most systematically</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.940" end="00:10:17.830" style="s2">expressed form of Penn psychism there</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.340" end="00:10:20.440" style="s2">really still today and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.830" end="00:10:21.820" style="s2">where I am now so I&#39;m expressing my</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.440" end="00:10:24.760" style="s2">ultimate goal philosophical goal</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.820" end="00:10:26.530" style="s2">probably is to try to fuse this notion</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.760" end="00:10:28.930" style="s2">of willpower from Nietzsche with</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.530" end="00:10:30.250" style="s2">whiteheads process philosophy and his</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.930" end="00:10:32.650" style="s2">pants are Kizza more what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.250" end="00:10:36.010" style="s2">philosophy of organism and allowing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.650" end="00:10:38.380" style="s2">to be informed by a new field which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.010" end="00:10:40.690" style="s2">psychedelic philosophy yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.380" end="00:10:42.820" style="s2">bringing so many difficult things</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.690" end="00:10:45.940" style="s2">together and to bring them together with</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.820" end="00:10:49.090" style="s2">psychedelics as well introduces so many</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.940" end="00:10:51.970" style="s2">anomalies there&#39;s little more mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.090" end="00:10:53.950" style="s2">I mean apart from psychedelics life</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.970" end="00:10:55.590" style="s2">itself is perhaps the only thing more</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.950" end="00:10:57.970" style="s2">mysterious that sits outside of it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.590" end="00:11:00.760" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot to unpack in what</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.970" end="00:11:03.520" style="s2">you said there especially as I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.760" end="00:11:05.920" style="s2">this conversation is one that can be of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.520" end="00:11:08.740" style="s2">utility to people who aren&#39;t technically</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.920" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">versed in in many of the in many of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.740" end="00:11:14.680" style="s2">theories we&#39;re talking about here but at</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:16.930" style="s2">least for my for my part psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.680" end="00:11:19.150" style="s2">offer a remarkably different way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.930" end="00:11:21.850" style="s2">relating to one&#39;s own being so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.150" end="00:11:23.890" style="s2">radical phenomenological shift what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.850" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">interesting about being in just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.890" end="00:11:28.780" style="s2">broadly referred to as a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:30.850" style="s2">state is the sense of responsibility one</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.780" end="00:11:34.300" style="s2">has for just maneuvering in the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.850" end="00:11:36.550" style="s2">and the agency one has to take</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.300" end="00:11:39.010" style="s2">responsibility for orienting through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.550" end="00:11:41.860" style="s2">world amongst what might have been maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.010" end="00:11:43.390" style="s2">very benign occurrences before but but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.860" end="00:11:45.850" style="s2">though all of a sudden take on a greater</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.390" end="00:11:47.590" style="s2">significance I mean certain elements of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.850" end="00:11:49.390" style="s2">the world can become much more salient</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.590" end="00:11:51.790" style="s2">to you than they otherwise were before</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.390" end="00:11:55.930" style="s2">but salient in a sense that has this</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.790" end="00:11:58.510" style="s2">real effective nature to it that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.930" end="00:11:59.890" style="s2">a sense of responsibility for how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.510" end="00:12:01.990" style="s2">need to negotiate</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.499" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">arguments and I think that it&#39;s the most</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">just that people aren&#39;t are not aware of</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:58.029" style="s2">generally considered slightly crazy in</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.029" end="00:14:00.999" style="s2">the West also because of a Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.029" end="00:14:02.679" style="s2">legacy that makes people them think in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.999" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">completely different way but once you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.679" end="00:14:06.189" style="s2">see the reasons it&#39;s very hard to at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">very least to not take them seriously</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.189" end="00:14:11.230" style="s2">and Hudson says one of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:14.379" style="s2">people don&#39;t as well as what I said is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.230" end="00:14:17.290" style="s2">the what he calls the prosaic fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.379" end="00:14:19.589" style="s2">which is the view that thought can only</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.290" end="00:14:21.970" style="s2">be a thought that we have our everyday</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.589" end="00:14:24.249" style="s2">prosaic dull consciousness were</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:26.799" style="s2">relatively bill right if only he says</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.249" end="00:14:28.779" style="s2">there were another method or another way</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.799" end="00:14:30.519" style="s2">by which we could detain other forms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.779" end="00:14:32.829" style="s2">experience this would make people more</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.519" end="00:14:34.389" style="s2">sympathetic to pass psychism because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.829" end="00:14:36.819" style="s2">couldn&#39;t we can&#39;t imagine what it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.389" end="00:14:40.209" style="s2">to be say a cell or a virus or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.819" end="00:14:41.290" style="s2">so he sort of them remnants traits that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.209" end="00:14:42.730" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a pity that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.290" end="00:14:44.440" style="s2">other way of attaining this form of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.730" end="00:14:46.090" style="s2">other forms of consciousness but of</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.440" end="00:14:48.970" style="s2">course there it&#39;s you know yeah yes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.090" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">psychedelics certainly gives you vast</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.970" end="00:14:56.110" style="s2">new array of mental forms of experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">so in itself that psychedelics perience</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.110" end="00:15:00.220" style="s2">can add to not the the reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:01.960" style="s2">parents autism but at least the sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.220" end="00:15:03.520" style="s2">towards it and perhaps this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.960" end="00:15:05.260" style="s2">what happened to William James because</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.520" end="00:15:07.780" style="s2">he&#39;s in well known for taking nitrous</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.260" end="00:15:09.730" style="s2">oxide ether and other certain other</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.780" end="00:15:12.130" style="s2">substances but mainly nitrous oxide and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.730" end="00:15:13.860" style="s2">later on in life in a book called a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.130" end="00:15:16.750" style="s2">pluralistic universe he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.860" end="00:15:18.970" style="s2">religious experiences even forming his</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.750" end="00:15:20.650" style="s2">sympathy for affection Arian point of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.970" end="00:15:22.780" style="s2">view and Gustav Fechner wasn&#39;t well</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.650" end="00:15:24.700" style="s2">known pants I kiss you see so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.780" end="00:15:29.340" style="s2">certainly think that yeah psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.700" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">can aid one&#39;s cognition of more radical</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.340" end="00:15:33.610" style="s2">philosophies of mind and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">whatever the truth is with regard to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.610" end="00:15:36.900" style="s2">mind matter problem it&#39;s gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:39.970" style="s2">be radical whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.900" end="00:15:42.070" style="s2">so therefore experiencing radical forms</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.970" end="00:15:44.080" style="s2">of consciousness is I think a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.070" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">legitimate way of the very least</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.080" end="00:15:48.820" style="s2">realizing what&#39;s possible what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.890" style="s2">be spoken about and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.820" end="00:15:52.180" style="s2">new thing really now that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.890" end="00:15:54.730" style="s2">about you know psychedelic philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.180" end="00:15:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just a new field of inquiry within</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.730" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">the philosophy of mind and within</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.080" end="00:16:00.370" style="s2">psychology neuroscience one and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:02.200" style="s2">why the conference&#39;s are generally</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.370" end="00:16:05.200" style="s2">interdisciplinary for psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.200" end="00:16:08.230" style="s2">because um it&#39;s such a it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.200" end="00:16:09.910" style="s2">novel form of experience that er people</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.230" end="00:16:13.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to tackle it you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.910" end="00:16:15.760" style="s2">right it seems to deal with I mean it it</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.990" end="00:16:17.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem like the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.760" end="00:16:21.520" style="s2">experience itself could ever deal with</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.670" end="00:16:23.740" style="s2">really anything but a huge dose of of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.520" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">anomaly you know I think part of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.740" end="00:16:29.640" style="s2">part of what gives it its effective</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:32.110" style="s2">quality is the fact that you are in some</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.640" end="00:16:34.840" style="s2">metaphorical sense and maybe not so</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.110" end="00:16:36.930" style="s2">metaphorical further out into the domain</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.840" end="00:16:39.220" style="s2">of the unknown at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.930" end="00:16:40.660" style="s2">phenomenologically interestingly airs</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.050" end="00:16:47.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about map mapping the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.640" end="00:16:49.390" style="s2">territory as I say at the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.140" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">everyone&#39;s a pioneer well exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.390" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">mapping the territory and if it can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:55.370" style="s2">mapped</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:56.690" style="s2">if its territory now we&#39;re talking mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.370" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">I metaphorically here sort of when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.690" end="00:17:00.500" style="s2">talking about territory of course you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">know and it might be the case that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.500" end="00:17:07.880" style="s2">whatever we map is merely the best we</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:10.220" style="s2">can do at the present time and so what</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.880" end="00:17:13.429" style="s2">we&#39;re mapping is in fact a well it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.220" end="00:17:17.209" style="s2">representation of sorts and it is true</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.429" end="00:17:19.669" style="s2">enough for the time it&#39;s pragmatic in</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.209" end="00:17:21.140" style="s2">that sense but then but but importantly</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.669" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">then and this is going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.140" end="00:17:25.789" style="s2">introduce an idea that I was mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:28.450" style="s2">to you earlier if we are engaged or to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.789" end="00:17:32.600" style="s2">engage in this in this process of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.450" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">exploring and mapping and re vivifying</p>

<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.150" style="s2">what becomes most important of all is</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:40.789" style="s2">the structure of investigation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.150" end="00:17:43.130" style="s2">communication that enables the continual</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.789" end="00:17:45.650" style="s2">and the continuation of the mapping and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.130" end="00:17:48.620" style="s2">remapping so what then becomes important</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.650" end="00:17:51.590" style="s2">is our commitment to the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.620" end="00:17:53.630" style="s2">communicative Reformation that makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.590" end="00:17:56.360" style="s2">possible the healthy adaptation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.630" end="00:17:59.090" style="s2">knowledge structures and so but you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.360" end="00:18:01.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a paragraph right at the end of</p>

<p begin="00:19:48.959" end="00:19:53.849" style="s2">of us is is actually much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.629" end="00:19:55.679" style="s2">not that that&#39;s an illusion but rather</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.450" end="00:20:04.849" style="s2">so once we&#39;ve accepted that yet</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.849" end="00:20:09.719" style="s2">absolutely sufficiently real a real</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.719" end="00:20:13.079" style="s2">one realizes that ok so if this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.089" end="00:20:14.609" style="s2">hallucination</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.079" end="00:20:17.309" style="s2">and if psychedelia is a hallucination</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.609" end="00:20:18.919" style="s2">then what is their relationship are they</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.309" end="00:20:21.359" style="s2">both is one a sort of higher level</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.919" end="00:20:24.119" style="s2">hallucination or are there aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.359" end="00:20:26.129" style="s2">psychedelia which actually as it were</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.119" end="00:20:28.289" style="s2">break down the hallucination of everyday</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.129" end="00:20:29.999" style="s2">reality so this is nothing new I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.289" end="00:20:31.739" style="s2">Aldous Huxley wrote about it based on</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.999" end="00:20:34.049" style="s2">Burke&#39;s on that as it happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.739" end="00:20:35.669" style="s2">doors perception but the view is that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.049" end="00:20:38.219" style="s2">lot of the stuff out there which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.669" end="00:20:40.259" style="s2">usually excluded from view taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.219" end="00:20:43.019" style="s2">by what Wyatt calls negative reactions</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.259" end="00:20:44.909" style="s2">is then allowed in as it were through</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.019" end="00:20:47.249" style="s2">through psychedelics with eyes open at</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.909" end="00:20:49.279" style="s2">least using valve either yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.249" end="00:20:52.469" style="s2">hugsley calls a reducing valve</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.279" end="00:20:54.929" style="s2">introduced via CD broad ultimately from</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.469" end="00:20:56.519" style="s2">Bergson and I&#39;ve got a lot of sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.929" end="00:20:59.940" style="s2">for that I mean for example when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.519" end="00:21:01.679" style="s2">look at a leaf on psilocybin you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.940" end="00:21:04.259" style="s2">immediately become aware well in certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.679" end="00:21:08.509" style="s2">cases you one can become aware of more</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.259" end="00:21:10.979" style="s2">tones of color more beauty you know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.509" end="00:21:13.259" style="s2">more intricacies generally and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.979" end="00:21:15.389" style="s2">heightened emotional perception of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.259" end="00:21:18.329" style="s2">being itself of the of the plant itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.389" end="00:21:19.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s not you know to say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.329" end="00:21:23.290" style="s2">hallucination of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.750" end="00:21:26.080" style="s2">relief I think is wrong I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.290" end="00:21:28.270" style="s2">rather no a greater understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.080" end="00:21:29.710" style="s2">totality of that leaf and the eat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.270" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">not a total understanding but yet</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.710" end="00:21:35.980" style="s2">there&#39;s more when my mind goes here is</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:37.720" style="s2">towards the I think we need to flesh out</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.980" end="00:21:41.740" style="s2">really what someone like Berks one means</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.720" end="00:21:45.300" style="s2">by the notion of duration and intuition</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.740" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">being that which we use essentially to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.300" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what binds us into the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:55.300" style="s2">duration itself duration being distinct</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:57.550" style="s2">from time as it&#39;s understood in physics</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.300" end="00:22:00.520" style="s2">so perhaps you could flesh out okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.550" end="00:22:02.500" style="s2">those notions for us well so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.520" end="00:22:05.560" style="s2">Bergson distinguishes duration from time</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.500" end="00:22:07.810" style="s2">inverted commas timers spatialized</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.560" end="00:22:12.270" style="s2">duration in other words a representation</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.810" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">of time as well senator is a pictorial</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.270" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">representation and fixed picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">real flow of experience that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">real flow of experience is duration is</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.530" style="s2">entering into the you know the self the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.810" style="s2">sort of the continual movement of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.530" end="00:22:31.150" style="s2">as we perceive them to represent that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.810" end="00:22:34.600" style="s2">duration which is not spatial temporal</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.150" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">and qualitative to represent her for</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.600" end="00:22:39.370" style="s2">models so to create technology and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:42.220" style="s2">predict the future we create a timeline</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.370" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">you know with t1 t2 t3 instants of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.220" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">an instant of time is not a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:49.960" style="s2">it&#39;s just our way of firm as it were</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">compartmentalizing reality actually away</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.960" end="00:22:56.560" style="s2">from the real of the duration precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">and as a result we misunderstand reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.560" end="00:23:03.460" style="s2">when we talk of it purely as something</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:05.800" style="s2">that moves forward along a line so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.460" end="00:23:08.200" style="s2">he calls a rhythm of duration is related</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.800" end="00:23:09.850" style="s2">pants psychism an interesting way so in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.200" end="00:23:13.060" style="s2">physics when we have a time line the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.850" end="00:23:16.750" style="s2">speed of time is irrelevant you know so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.060" end="00:23:19.180" style="s2">from you know 2017 is 2018 that one year</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.750" end="00:23:22.450" style="s2">a human a certain human will experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.180" end="00:23:25.420" style="s2">that duration as a certain duration and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.450" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">a real duration whereas perhaps a snail</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.420" end="00:23:30.970" style="s2">or a fly will experience it as a much</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:33.040" style="s2">longer duration but of course in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.970" end="00:23:33.580" style="s2">of a pictorial line it&#39;s the same but in</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.040" end="00:23:35.920" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.580" end="00:23:37.720" style="s2">see the duration is totally distinct and</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.920" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a really interesting argument</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.720" end="00:23:43.030" style="s2">that Bergson makes which can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:45.310" style="s2">developed I plan to later on which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.030" end="00:23:48.310" style="s2">this that there isn&#39;t but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.310" end="00:23:51.580" style="s2">absolute speed of time we all experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.310" end="00:23:53.460" style="s2">time difference and experience time as</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.580" end="00:23:55.750" style="s2">faster or slower depending on mood and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.460" end="00:23:57.100" style="s2">environments like unicycle II right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.750" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">excited and that&#39;s where that comes in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.100" end="00:24:01.840" style="s2">as well of course but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.090" style="s2">absolute speed of time so that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.840" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">that even a million years in theory</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.090" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">could be experienced as what we would</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:09.310" style="s2">consider one second or vice-versa a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:12.250" style="s2">second isn&#39;t really as a terrifying one</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">if you stretch that duration to infinity</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:02.230" style="s2">to what we think about the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.130" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">empirically or descriptively using the</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.110" style="s2">have a system of sort of fixed</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.770" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">representations in some sense but in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.110" end="00:27:12.340" style="s2">order to update them in a very real</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">sense we have to engage with the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.340" end="00:27:18.400" style="s2">of the world itself and some at some</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:21.910" style="s2">brutally experiential level yes in order</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.400" end="00:27:25.240" style="s2">to save what is in a sense most most</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.910" end="00:27:26.710" style="s2">real but it but it&#39;s a strange thing to</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.240" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">tie these worlds together because on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.710" end="00:27:31.450" style="s2">one hand we have a you know a really</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:33.220" style="s2">mythological way in a very psychological</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.450" end="00:27:36.250" style="s2">way of talking and on another we have a</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.250" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">at the end of the day of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:42.670" style="s2">metaphysics hmm so but but did you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">the links between these ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.670" end="00:27:48.190" style="s2">that that I do okay yeah I mean my my</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:49.900" style="s2">knowledge of Union psychologies is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.190" end="00:27:51.280" style="s2">deep but the hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.900" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">I mean hero&#39;s journey today is</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.280" end="00:27:55.030" style="s2">psychedelic experience you know like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:56.350" style="s2">were saying uncharted territory the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.030" end="00:27:57.420" style="s2">undiscovered country of course that</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.350" end="00:28:00.070" style="s2">means death and Shakespeare but</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.420" end="00:28:01.510" style="s2">certainly going there</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.070" end="00:28:02.710" style="s2">risky psychologically if not</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.510" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">physiologically but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.710" end="00:28:06.490" style="s2">psychologically risky and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.600" end="00:28:09.850" style="s2">recommend it to every person that reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.490" end="00:28:12.820" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s so much to gain</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.850" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">there I mean at the very very least new</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.820" end="00:28:17.140" style="s2">phenomenological concepts and tools</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:19.090" style="s2">perhaps but of course you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.140" end="00:28:21.430" style="s2">the journey come back try to analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.090" end="00:28:23.980" style="s2">in that way and then I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.430" end="00:28:25.630" style="s2">certainly add on to the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.980" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">mind completely at the moment philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.630" end="00:28:29.830" style="s2">of mind very restricted to prosaic</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:31.990" style="s2">sentience that&#39;s its you know which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.830" end="00:28:33.490" style="s2">only the smallest well not the smallest</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.990" end="00:28:35.830" style="s2">but it&#39;s very interesting but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.490" end="00:28:38.680" style="s2">small element of what can be experienced</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.830" end="00:28:40.390" style="s2">I mean even the classification of</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.680" end="00:28:41.620" style="s2">phenomenology into its concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.390" end="00:28:43.810" style="s2">percepts and things like that can all be</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.620" end="00:28:47.770" style="s2">questioned very much so there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.810" end="00:28:51.930" style="s2">as I say new land out there to explore -</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.770" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">yep - a journey - and back I think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.930" end="00:28:57.040" style="s2">also am in terms of in terms of basic</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:59.260" style="s2">science you know the neural correlates</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.040" end="00:29:01.000" style="s2">of consciousness so you know can learn a</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.260" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">lot from it david nutt says you know if</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.000" end="00:29:05.590" style="s2">you want to understand consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:07.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to look at psychedelics also</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.590" end="00:29:09.220" style="s2">yeah in terms of not only in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.750" end="00:29:10.870" style="s2">you know business shaft in a general</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.220" end="00:29:13.240" style="s2">knowledge for people but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.870" end="00:29:15.580" style="s2">your own self you know Nietzsche said</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.240" end="00:29:18.250" style="s2">the knowledge acquired or the experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.580" end="00:29:21.340" style="s2">acquired in dreams adds to the richness</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.250" end="00:29:23.350" style="s2">of one&#39;s life as much as thus everyday</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.340" end="00:29:25.180" style="s2">life right and if you consider</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.350" end="00:29:27.670" style="s2">psychedelic experience as a sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.180" end="00:29:28.990" style="s2">know incredible dream really yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.670" end="00:29:32.560" style="s2">of course you know the richness of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.990" end="00:29:35.620" style="s2">life is you know immeasurably heightened</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.560" end="00:29:38.770" style="s2">so people who don&#39;t do psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.620" end="00:29:40.930" style="s2">really you know keeping their quality of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.770" end="00:29:42.430" style="s2">their life low with the qualification</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.930" end="00:29:44.380" style="s2">like I said that it&#39;s not for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.430" end="00:29:45.550" style="s2">because some people are quite happy like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.380" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">that you know some people are quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.550" end="00:29:50.560" style="s2">happy with everyday reality routine</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:52.990" style="s2">practicality or not but but for</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.560" end="00:29:54.010" style="s2">knowledge seekers you know one has to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.990" end="00:29:55.930" style="s2">take the risk one has to make that</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.010" end="00:29:57.970" style="s2">journey yeah oh absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.930" end="00:30:00.700" style="s2">might be worth saying that that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.970" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">to me that the the effective meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.700" end="00:30:04.510" style="s2">associated with psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:06.910" style="s2">consciousness draws from the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.510" end="00:30:10.510" style="s2">substrate in some sense that that dreams</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.910" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">do that that the real effective you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.510" end="00:30:13.900" style="s2">the affective meaning that you and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:16.570" style="s2">you encounter that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.900" end="00:30:18.310" style="s2">that agitates you that that imbues you</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.570" end="00:30:20.500" style="s2">that that you relate to as though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.310" end="00:30:21.610" style="s2">part of who you are in some sense and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.500" end="00:30:23.520" style="s2">these moments of going through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.610" end="00:30:25.660" style="s2">experience draws from the same</p>

<p begin="00:30:25.660" end="00:30:33.720" style="s2">imaginative there as dreams to now Union</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.940" end="00:30:36.820" style="s2">interpretations of dreams lead to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.720" end="00:30:40.050" style="s2">concepts like archetypes an archetype</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.150" end="00:30:57.700" style="s2">these are two technical terms to use but</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.830" end="00:30:59.680" style="s2">um so okay so do the one thing I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.700" end="00:31:01.060" style="s2">before you continue is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.680" end="00:31:02.440" style="s2">I think him to compare</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.060" end="00:31:04.810" style="s2">phenomenologically the difference</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.440" end="00:31:06.970" style="s2">between although they have this shared</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.810" end="00:31:09.670" style="s2">base no doubt it&#39;s very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.970" end="00:31:10.930" style="s2">still distinguish dream that the average</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.670" end="00:31:11.770" style="s2">imeem there are so many different types</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.930" end="00:31:13.030" style="s2">of dreams and there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.770" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">different types of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.030" end="00:31:16.570" style="s2">experience but to generalize yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">think you can it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.570" end="00:31:21.820" style="s2">compare dreams to psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:24.280" style="s2">to hypnagogic hallucinations and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.820" end="00:31:25.480" style="s2">other other similar forms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.280" end="00:31:26.590" style="s2">consciousness meditation perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.480" end="00:31:28.570" style="s2">something like this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.590" end="00:31:29.800" style="s2">and see how they do differ it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.570" end="00:31:32.110" style="s2">me like one not always but generally</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.800" end="00:31:33.670" style="s2">dreams have a narrative you know you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.110" end="00:31:36.220" style="s2">in them and you walk along and you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.670" end="00:31:38.890" style="s2">something even if you turn into a lorry</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:41.230" style="s2">or whatever yeah it&#39;s still somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.890" end="00:31:42.640" style="s2">narrative but in conscious distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">hope my going to loosen ations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.640" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">psychedelic spirits generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">again often don&#39;t have that narrative in</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:51.940" style="s2">fact you even you know famously you lose</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">yourself another word well well not you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.940" end="00:31:56.200" style="s2">because that&#39;s saying you&#39;re still there</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">but the self is lost or fragmented so</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.200" end="00:32:00.250" style="s2">becomes one with everything the ego</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">selfie oh my okay yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.250" end="00:32:04.750" style="s2">so although dreams are somewhat similar</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:08.260" style="s2">they are you know they do different very</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.750" end="00:32:11.470" style="s2">interesting ways right yeah so so it may</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.260" end="00:32:13.120" style="s2">be the case that the narrative the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.470" end="00:32:14.950" style="s2">structural narrative of someone</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.120" end="00:32:17.080" style="s2">undergoing a psychedelic experience is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.950" end="00:32:18.970" style="s2">lost to that person at the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.080" end="00:32:21.250" style="s2">certainly that they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.970" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">cohesive representation of what it is at</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.250" end="00:32:25.330" style="s2">the time although it&#39;s often the case I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:27.070" style="s2">think that much of what helps people</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.330" end="00:32:27.340" style="s2">process what they&#39;ve been through is</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.070" end="00:32:29.530" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.340" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">after the fact you then go about</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.530" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">ascribing some sort of narrative or</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:35.290" style="s2">description of it yeah I mean you always</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">say that I then experience this and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.290" end="00:32:38.560" style="s2">I saw this and that I had it better of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.660" style="s2">course that&#39;s retrospective as you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.560" end="00:32:43.330" style="s2">certainly the tying together is</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.660" end="00:32:45.520" style="s2">retrospective however that effective</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.330" end="00:32:47.410" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s encountered that then</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.520" end="00:32:50.830" style="s2">later is reflected on in order to tie</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.410" end="00:32:53.650" style="s2">together very well may still draw on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.830" end="00:32:55.990" style="s2">same well sources of meaning it may be</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.650" end="00:32:59.110" style="s2">the case that what you happen to notice</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.990" end="00:33:01.300" style="s2">about the location of objects in a room</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.110" end="00:33:03.280" style="s2">or perhaps the particular activity that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.300" end="00:33:05.940" style="s2">two people are doing in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.280" end="00:33:07.720" style="s2">perhaps one of them is slightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.940" end="00:33:09.940" style="s2">frustrated at the other person and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.720" end="00:33:12.520" style="s2">there&#39;s an a sort of aggressive mode of</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.940" end="00:33:14.430" style="s2">communication between them and and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.520" end="00:33:17.140" style="s2">under the psychedelic experience perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.430" end="00:33:19.420" style="s2">fragments apart how secure you feel in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.140" end="00:33:22.170" style="s2">the social environment might make you</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.420" end="00:33:25.210" style="s2">think of just how tentative and</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.170" end="00:33:27.810" style="s2">temperamental societal relations can be</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.210" end="00:33:30.820" style="s2">and and then maybe starts to have you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.810" end="00:33:33.070" style="s2">dissociate your security sort of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.820" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">fragments and and all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.070" end="00:33:38.290" style="s2">have here you might recognize in front</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:41.410" style="s2">of you a certain warring perhaps of of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.290" end="00:33:43.120" style="s2">masculine and feminine element and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.410" end="00:33:45.070" style="s2">of a sudden the people arguing in front</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.120" end="00:33:48.430" style="s2">of you take on much more meaning than</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.070" end="00:33:50.380" style="s2">just the than just a Dan and Mary that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.430" end="00:33:52.900" style="s2">were having a chat but now they might in</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.380" end="00:33:55.920" style="s2">some sense be standing for the two</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.900" end="00:33:58.120" style="s2">pillars of the two principles that hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.920" end="00:34:00.280" style="s2">society together and that we use as</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.120" end="00:34:02.590" style="s2">representations to sort of buttress us</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.280" end="00:34:04.510" style="s2">in the world right from the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.590" end="00:34:07.240" style="s2">right from the beginning of life and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.510" end="00:34:10.150" style="s2">things can take on these narrative old</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.240" end="00:34:12.550" style="s2">tropes that you wouldn&#39;t expect someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.150" end="00:34:15.850" style="s2">to be able to put together at the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.550" end="00:34:18.010" style="s2">if they hadn&#39;t been living with and</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.850" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">working with such archetypes for a long</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.010" end="00:34:21.730" style="s2">period of time and even then I believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:23.920" style="s2">in psychedelics they&#39;re so powerful that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.730" end="00:34:25.510" style="s2">the possibility always remains there for</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.920" end="00:34:27.280" style="s2">them to completely subsume you and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.510" end="00:34:29.080" style="s2">submerge whatever you can pull together</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.280" end="00:34:31.570" style="s2">as coherent in the moment and you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.080" end="00:34:34.020" style="s2">truly out in the unknown so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.570" end="00:34:36.550" style="s2">surprise me that such a fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.020" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">coherence is part of the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.550" end="00:34:40.780" style="s2">experience but to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:43.000" style="s2">engaged meaningfully in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.780" end="00:34:46.570" style="s2">at all it seems to be the case that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.000" end="00:34:51.429" style="s2">can&#39;t escape how we are involved with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.570" end="00:34:53.800" style="s2">how life is involved mmm life seems to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.429" end="00:34:56.470" style="s2">have if nothing else an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.800" end="00:34:59.110" style="s2">keeping itself around preserving itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.470" end="00:35:01.720" style="s2">and also complexify in itself it seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.110" end="00:35:03.790" style="s2">and my point might be whether the post</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.720" end="00:35:05.800" style="s2">hoc analysis just puts together the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.790" end="00:35:08.350" style="s2">narrative or not the themes that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.800" end="00:35:11.080" style="s2">draws on seem still to appear and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.350" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">constitute what people speak of is so</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.080" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">relevant and interesting in their</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:17.500" style="s2">psychedelic experiences so two things</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:19.390" style="s2">really there the notion of the self that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:23.020" style="s2">runs through there first of all although</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.390" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">you may not feel that you are you know a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.020" end="00:35:27.820" style="s2">self mm-hmm and again you is not the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:30.250" style="s2">word not the right word I should say the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.820" end="00:35:34.690" style="s2">notion that itself is not there may be</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.250" end="00:35:37.510" style="s2">felt by whom but of course if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.690" end="00:35:39.070" style="s2">remembered there is that unifying factor</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.510" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t it mm-hm and that&#39;s perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.070" end="00:35:42.730" style="s2">something analogous to what camp calls</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:45.160" style="s2">pure a perception it&#39;s what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.730" end="00:35:47.500" style="s2">assume is that although you can never</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.160" end="00:35:48.850" style="s2">perceive it directly as you can with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.500" end="00:35:50.110" style="s2">psychological self empirical a</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.470" end="00:35:59.770" style="s2">that of course there could be many cycle</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:01.570" style="s2">experiences which are never remembered</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.770" end="00:36:03.880" style="s2">it&#39;s theoretically possible that their</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.500" style="s2">interesting question so but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.830" end="00:36:16.330" style="s2">everything is somewhere retained somehow</p>

<p begin="00:36:17.710" end="00:36:24.340" style="s2">certainly I&#39;ve had very typically a</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.910" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">I&#39;m probably sympathetic to such an</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.259" end="00:37:02.619" style="s2">archetype you know darkness of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:04.749" style="s2">was the god of intoxication so that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.619" end="00:37:06.670" style="s2">brings us full circle but if he is where</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.749" end="00:37:10.089" style="s2">town than that of course also represents</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.670" end="00:37:11.079" style="s2">the great warrior king which again from</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.089" end="00:37:13.089" style="s2">a Nietzschean point of view I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.079" end="00:37:14.859" style="s2">sympathy for terms of a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.089" end="00:37:16.839" style="s2">romanticism of the past especially my</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.859" end="00:37:18.460" style="s2">Scandinavian past there&#39;s a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.839" end="00:37:20.289" style="s2">unpack there I mean that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.460" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">the the thing that calls me towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.289" end="00:37:24.970" style="s2">being more and more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.210" end="00:37:28.269" style="s2">mythological representations of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.970" end="00:37:31.569" style="s2">fundamentally was that an image as it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.269" end="00:37:33.940" style="s2">were can contain what an image can</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.569" end="00:37:35.859" style="s2">convey may take several pages to convey</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.940" end="00:37:37.539" style="s2">and maybe you still can&#39;t even in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.859" end="00:37:39.309" style="s2">right yeah I find that I have a dream</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.539" end="00:37:41.499" style="s2">log and just conveying the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.309" end="00:37:45.279" style="s2">sense of a dream sometimes can take</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.499" end="00:37:45.940" style="s2">reams of pages one meaning one one image</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.279" end="00:37:50.009" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.940" end="00:37:52.690" style="s2">and so what images seem to have allowed</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.009" end="00:37:55.779" style="s2">allowed us to do is to hold</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.690" end="00:37:59.109" style="s2">contradictory elements in them in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.779" end="00:38:01.239" style="s2">sense and there is a strange in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.109" end="00:38:02.799" style="s2">dissociation of the ego there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.239" end="00:38:05.109" style="s2">strange because when people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.799" end="00:38:06.749" style="s2">ego dissolution they mean this they I</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.109" end="00:38:09.099" style="s2">think they mean something like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.749" end="00:38:10.960" style="s2">annihilation of your ordinary way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.099" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">relating to being moment to moment and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.960" end="00:38:14.829" style="s2">perhaps the coherence of that moment to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:17.349" style="s2">moment experience basically what Kant</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.829" end="00:38:20.049" style="s2">calls empirical absorption right okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.349" end="00:38:21.940" style="s2">the psychological self yeah but as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.049" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">discussed that there remains a and a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.940" end="00:38:25.660" style="s2">nexus or a node of experience there that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:27.160" style="s2">persists and and I think you know for</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:29.259" style="s2">memory sake right and I call that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.160" end="00:38:31.150" style="s2">something like the Explorer it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.259" end="00:38:34.119" style="s2">metaphorical word but it there is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.150" end="00:38:36.249" style="s2">persistence yes and so okay we can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.119" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">destroyed about remain</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.249" end="00:38:39.969" style="s2">I mean younger talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:42.279" style="s2">destruction as a temporary death so his</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.969" end="00:38:44.109" style="s2">belief it it seemed at least from his</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.279" end="00:38:47.499" style="s2">correspondence with Albert Hoffman</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.109" end="00:38:48.849" style="s2">creative LST was that the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.499" end="00:38:51.339" style="s2">experience this is what happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.849" end="00:38:53.619" style="s2">when you die this is similar to what err</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.339" end="00:38:55.269" style="s2">thought as well or how they interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.619" end="00:38:56.950" style="s2">their experience this is complete</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.269" end="00:38:59.829" style="s2">fragmentation of the individual self but</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.950" end="00:39:01.390" style="s2">yet something remains and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.829" end="00:39:04.390" style="s2">interesting thing is could that be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.390" end="00:39:06.519" style="s2">taste of the afterlife well again it</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.390" end="00:39:07.869" style="s2">when we talk about metaphysics we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.519" end="00:39:09.700" style="s2">never speak about proof</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.869" end="00:39:11.559" style="s2">as proof only exists in mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:13.660" style="s2">logic and then you can question that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.559" end="00:39:15.099" style="s2">relationship to reality anyway even in</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.660" end="00:39:16.509" style="s2">science you can&#39;t really get proof you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.099" end="00:39:18.329" style="s2">can only get it seems if you follow</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.509" end="00:39:21.279" style="s2">popper anyway a proof of falsification</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.329" end="00:39:22.900" style="s2">so there&#39;s a theory out there we never</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.279" end="00:39:24.819" style="s2">really know it&#39;s true but we at least</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.900" end="00:39:26.430" style="s2">can hold out the possibility that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.819" end="00:39:28.630" style="s2">will be disproved mmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.430" end="00:39:29.950" style="s2">but with metaphysics I mean I remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.630" end="00:39:31.749" style="s2">in Sweden actually people saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.950" end="00:39:34.150" style="s2">but you can&#39;t prove prove this stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.749" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">yeah if you if you stick to proof you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.150" end="00:39:37.809" style="s2">stuck to solipsism you can only prove</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:41.019" style="s2">that you yourself exists it seems and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.809" end="00:39:42.579" style="s2">that&#39;s it so we talked about inference</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.019" end="00:39:45.490" style="s2">to the best explanation or analogy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.579" end="00:39:47.589" style="s2">whatever and I&#39;m agnostic here about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.490" end="00:39:49.150" style="s2">afterlife but certainly it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.589" end="00:39:50.920" style="s2">interesting idea that yes Aikido</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.150" end="00:39:53.289" style="s2">experienced us offer you this taste of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.920" end="00:39:54.609" style="s2">death generally quite exciting unless</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.289" end="00:39:56.769" style="s2">you have a bad trip and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.609" end="00:39:57.910" style="s2">actually quite horrifying and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.769" end="00:39:59.829" style="s2">what what I mean when I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.910" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">psychedelics being psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.829" end="00:40:03.640" style="s2">damaging I mean if you were religiously</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">minded if you&#39;re brought up that way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.640" end="00:40:07.749" style="s2">then you have this horrific experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:10.180" style="s2">and psilocybin of a hell something</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.749" end="00:40:11.499" style="s2">hellish you know then that then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.180" end="00:40:14.440" style="s2">not going to look forward to your death</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.499" end="00:40:17.349" style="s2">yeah I mean even even less so than</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.440" end="00:40:18.460" style="s2">normal right but of course then you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.349" end="00:40:19.779" style="s2">look at the Tibetan Book of the Dead or</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.460" end="00:40:21.519" style="s2">whatever and realize this is the phase I</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.779" end="00:40:22.690" style="s2">mean even in the Eleusinian mysteries in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.519" end="00:40:24.910" style="s2">ancient Greece you know the first phase</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.690" end="00:40:28.210" style="s2">was horrific Cora terror and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.910" end="00:40:30.339" style="s2">eventually the great Elysian Fields you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.210" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">know of their heaven that was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.339" end="00:40:33.819" style="s2">point of you know the the sort of annual</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.589" style="s2">alludes Indian mysteries in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.819" end="00:40:38.259" style="s2">Greece she knows it was to prepare one</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.589" end="00:40:41.140" style="s2">for death and that&#39;s what you know Plato</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.259" end="00:40:42.789" style="s2">said and other great thinkers so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.140" end="00:40:44.529" style="s2">I mean okay so if there&#39;s survival after</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.789" end="00:40:46.239" style="s2">death then of course it isn&#39;t on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.529" end="00:40:48.489" style="s2">individual level but psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.239" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">perhaps are for that example of existing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.489" end="00:40:51.290" style="s2">without you know this empirical a</p>
