<p begin="00:00:04.399" end="00:00:05.879" style="s2">So now let&#39;s talk about virtual reality.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.879" end="00:00:11.080" style="s2">We have this idea that one of the things that<br />our media does, one of the things the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.080" end="00:00:19.220" style="s2">that we perceive the world does, is change<br />the nature of how our psychology works.</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.220" end="00:00:24.089" style="s2">Our psychology is designed to be adaptive<br />to our environment, and so if I change the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.089" end="00:00:28.939" style="s2">way that we&#39;re interacting with the environment<br />I change the psychology, and that has durable</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.939" end="00:00:30.279" style="s2">effects.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.279" end="00:00:34.879" style="s2">VR is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.879" end="00:00:46.710" style="s2">It represents a radical increase in our capacity<br />to modify the way that we perceive reality.</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.710" end="00:00:56.130" style="s2">It&#39;s highly immersive, it&#39;s multi-modal, so<br />in principle it can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic—I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.130" end="00:01:00.489" style="s2">mean we could layer other things potentially<br />in, with electrical stimulation and olfactory</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.489" end="00:01:07.400" style="s2">if we want to—but the idea is that our conscious<br />sense of self-identity, our position in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.400" end="00:01:10.820" style="s2">world, is actually a relatively loosely held<br />construct.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.820" end="00:01:14.830" style="s2">There&#39;s been very good experiments on the<br />way that you can actually cause someone’s</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.830" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">sense of even where their body is in space<br />to just go away and make them feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">15 feet in front of where they actually are,<br />because we&#39;re always doing our best job to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:30.940" style="s2">integrate the total input of our sensory modalities<br />to make a coherent gestalt of, &#39;Oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.940" end="00:01:32.380" style="s2">world, and this is self.&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.380" end="00:01:41.090" style="s2">And what VR does is it provides enough fidelity<br />of information and enough coherence of modality</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.090" end="00:01:47.750" style="s2">to jack or hack that underlying mechanism<br />whereby we actually create our construct of</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.750" end="00:01:49.440" style="s2">self and world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.440" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">That&#39;s a serious fucking thing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:55.640" style="s2">If you think about the way a little kid interfaces<br />with a film, a movie; for a little while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.640" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">sort of confused about what&#39;s real and what&#39;s<br />not real when they&#39;re observing it, but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">enough difference between sitting in a chair<br />and watching a video and being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">that eventually you learn to recognize and<br />separate the two.</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:16.430" style="s2">In VR, and as we get better and better at<br />doing it, that distinction goes away.</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.430" end="00:02:19.069" style="s2">And this is quite important.</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.069" end="00:02:24.609" style="s2">The line between what it means to be dreaming<br />and what it means to be awake is going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.609" end="00:02:31.529" style="s2">become very interesting, and it&#39;s going to<br />become more and more interesting, because</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.529" end="00:02:36.430" style="s2">remember VR is just one piece of a generalized<br />consequence of accelerating technology.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.430" end="00:02:41.549" style="s2">So it&#39;s not just that we&#39;re going to be doing<br />VR, we&#39;re also going to be radically improving</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.549" end="00:02:44.359" style="s2">our actuation capacity in the world in general.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.359" end="00:02:51.659" style="s2">And so we can imagine circumstances where<br />I might craft an object in VR, and then—say</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.659" end="00:02:57.849" style="s2">in quasi-real-time—some mechanism is in<br />fact actually 3D printing that object so then</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.849" end="00:03:01.312" style="s2">I reach out, take off my VR glasses and the<br />thing that I thought I was creating in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.312" end="00:03:06.079" style="s2">entirely imaginary space is actually physically<br />present in my hand.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.079" end="00:03:09.749" style="s2">That&#39;s going to cause some very interesting<br />changes in the way that we relate to the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.749" end="00:03:13.790" style="s2">between what reality can do and what imagination<br />can do.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.790" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">And as I mentioned to you in our sort of conversation<br />before this thing started, as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:25.389" style="s2">of all this VR is particularly effective at<br />blowing your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.389" end="00:03:29.579" style="s2">And I mean in terms of disrupting your underlying<br />construct about what the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.579" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">happens to be.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:34.109" style="s2">And this is very good news and also extraordinarily<br />bad news.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.109" end="00:03:40.129" style="s2">From the extraordinarily bad perspective it<br />means that VR is extremely well-positioned</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.129" end="00:03:48.980" style="s2">to create a designed reality that you&#39;re going<br />to have a very, very hard time rejecting.</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.980" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">If you think about the way that propaganda,<br />back in the early 20th century, got good at</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:57.669" style="s2">understanding how human beings parse information<br />to make decisions and getting in underneath</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.669" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">our psychological defense mechanisms, VR is<br />100 million times more capable of engaging</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:05.589" style="s2">in that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.589" end="00:04:13.199" style="s2">The good news is, is if we do a much, much<br />better job at being—let&#39;s call it ethical—at</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.199" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">crafting a relationship between our power<br />to affect the world and the way that power</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:23.620" style="s2">affects us, so if we do a much, much better<br />job at being ethical around VR, then it will</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.620" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">be the most powerful tool that we have for<br />radically improving the way that we respond</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">to the world, for upgrading our capacity to<br />respond to the world, because it would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.620" end="00:04:39.039" style="s2">a much more embodied and whole system hack<br />for our deep constructs.</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.039" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">Does that make sense?</p>
