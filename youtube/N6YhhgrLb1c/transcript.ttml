<p begin="00:00:35.700" end="00:00:39.870" style="s2">for that what we want to talk about is I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.770" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">have as many of you know this project</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.870" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">and it&#39;s being exemplified in voices of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">a key of trying to understand the set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">practices that I&#39;m collectively calling</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:52.699" style="s2">you know dialectic and how they afford</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.780" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">this emergent way of cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.699" end="00:00:57.930" style="s2">collective intelligence into collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.989" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">wisdom and I call that deal logos the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:03.270" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing with Chris and also with</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">Jordan that guy and Peter Lindberg and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.270" end="00:01:06.090" style="s2">some of you have also seen some</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve had with and ursini</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.090" end="00:01:11.850" style="s2">and Zack sign about this and and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">this has a connection to a revision aim</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.850" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">of what education means and then Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">has expressed that he&#39;s very interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">now in this this connection between</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">education more broadly understood as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">way I think maybe a better term might</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:31.820" style="s2">even be you know like inculturation not</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">just education and how that intersects</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.820" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">with dialectic as a practice and via</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">logos as a phenomenon so is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:44.310" style="s2">representation burden of the context of</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">the discussion yeah that&#39;s great so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.310" end="00:01:49.140" style="s2">gonna begin with what I step towards you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">know before we started recording maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.140" end="00:01:57.079" style="s2">give you something to riff on because</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">I&#39;m very interested in fact and I see if</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.079" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">dialectic as a practice in Villalobos as</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">a process is ultimately you know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">you&#39;re seeking information through</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:11.910" style="s2">transformation the idea that we we only</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">can be informed by what transcends us by</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.910" end="00:02:16.590" style="s2">going through a process of transfer</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the only way and so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.590" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">reconfigure the notion of gathering</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">information and education and we linking</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">it back to transformation and then that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:28.380" style="s2">puts me into the notion that this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">ultimately an aspirational process this</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.380" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">transformation is the aspiration to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">transcend who and what you are become</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">something other than you are and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:42.140" style="s2">that leads me into this idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:45.020" style="s2">discussing about education and I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.140" end="00:02:48.300" style="s2">Anzac seems to resonate with this -</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.020" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">education not being primary about</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.300" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">providing information but a40 a place in</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">which people can seriously play with</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:03:02.370" style="s2">ways of life ways of being that will</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:05.190" style="s2">afford afford that aspiration and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.370" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">transformation and I see it as deeply</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.190" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">exemplified in Socratic practice a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:12.150" style="s2">of authors point out that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">dialogues often don&#39;t come to an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.150" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">argumentative conclusion because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:19.020" style="s2">arguments a lot of importance are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">actually focal what&#39;s focal what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.020" end="00:03:23.820" style="s2">really being compared and Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:28.550" style="s2">exemplifying or ways of life ways of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.820" end="00:03:32.490" style="s2">being and the and the the enactment of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.550" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">the logos is a way in which you get a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.490" end="00:03:35.190" style="s2">taste for a different way of being a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:36.990" style="s2">different way of thinking a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.190" end="00:03:40.650" style="s2">way of seeing different way of being</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.990" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">with other people a different way right</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.650" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">a different way of living a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:46.410" style="s2">way of life and so I&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:50.300" style="s2">deeply interested in this connection</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.410" end="00:03:54.480" style="s2">between dialectic via logos</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.300" end="00:03:57.510" style="s2">transformation enculturation and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.480" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">know this idea of Education being much</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.510" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">more about what used to be called virtue</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:09.600" style="s2">mmhmm yeah very nice yeah it&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">things that come up there are we have we</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.600" end="00:04:14.310" style="s2">contend with the notion of enculturation</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:17.850" style="s2">yeah immediately will come to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.310" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">the I think in many cases the the intent</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.850" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">or the accident of an endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">generate a enculturation which Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:30.120" style="s2">toward stasis</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:33.940" style="s2">a culture that consciously endeavors to</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.120" end="00:04:36.250" style="s2">enculturate itself without change right</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.940" end="00:04:38.830" style="s2">right much of any education has that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:41.080" style="s2">characteristic you might say for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.830" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a nice distinction between world</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.080" end="00:04:48.580" style="s2">through what is relevant right in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">an education that is focused on true is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.580" end="00:04:54.310" style="s2">very much oriented towards stasis</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:56.410" style="s2">because it assumes relevance as a basis</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.310" end="00:04:58.710" style="s2">and then tries to get you those things</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.410" end="00:05:02.370" style="s2">that are true subject in that relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.710" end="00:05:04.360" style="s2">educating focuses on relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.370" end="00:05:06.550" style="s2">recognizes that what is relevant may in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.360" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">fact be changing continuously and our</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">job is to maintain a a coherent capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:14.140" style="s2">to be to end culture it to maintain in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:17.590" style="s2">it some kind of coherent integrity or</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.140" end="00:05:19.780" style="s2">wholeness beingness of culture in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.590" end="00:05:21.400" style="s2">context that is adaptive to it is really</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.780" end="00:05:25.510" style="s2">actually changing and therefore is sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.400" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">of a surfing through reality without</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.510" end="00:05:30.730" style="s2">saying that that Buckminster Fuller</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">raised and contra for exactly how he</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.730" end="00:05:36.640" style="s2">said it it&#39;s like you know I&#39;m a knot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:38.680" style="s2">causation if this loop there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.640" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">cause like every every I&#39;m a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.680" end="00:05:42.490" style="s2">phenomena of self replicating processes</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">but there&#39;s no moment at which if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.490" end="00:05:47.080" style="s2">did like a frozen snapshot of me and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:48.970" style="s2">tried to say that was me you&#39;d be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.080" end="00:05:50.860" style="s2">like all the atoms that I breathe in and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.970" end="00:05:53.380" style="s2">breathe out every phenomenon that could</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.860" end="00:05:54.490" style="s2">be considered material is just well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.380" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">like a wave in the ocean right the wave</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.490" end="00:05:58.330" style="s2">in the ocean is not the water molecules</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:06:01.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the process that&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.330" end="00:06:03.190" style="s2">through the way through the ocean and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.060" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">a culture which is able to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.190" end="00:06:09.370" style="s2">be aware of this and endeavor to embody</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:11.890" style="s2">a method of enculturation which has this</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.370" end="00:06:13.690" style="s2">focus on virtue which is to say focus on</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.890" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">those aspects that are actually</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.200" end="00:06:24.580" style="s2">creating something which is able to</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">question of how do we actually learn</p>

<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:42.620" style="s2">and I was thinking about this we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:43.819" style="s2">talk about deal logos which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.620" end="00:06:46.310" style="s2">subject is actually how does one become</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:06:59.720" style="s2">self-supporting because one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.129" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">of the loops of do logos is that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.720" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the supports in yourself and those</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">who are participating increasing clarity</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">of how to be an agent e logos you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:10.819" style="s2">that now for free if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:13.729" style="s2">participating with it then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.819" end="00:07:15.110" style="s2">other stuff on top that&#39;s excellent so</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.729" end="00:07:18.139" style="s2">there&#39;s three points that I want that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.110" end="00:07:22.430" style="s2">want to first you said about relevance</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.139" end="00:07:25.400" style="s2">and about agency so the first is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.430" end="00:07:27.650" style="s2">that distinction you made is analogous</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.400" end="00:07:29.620" style="s2">to distinction that I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.650" end="00:07:31.400" style="s2">I&#39;m throwing out of the literature</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.620" end="00:07:34.370" style="s2">especially the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.400" end="00:07:36.259" style="s2">literature and also the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.370" end="00:07:37.780" style="s2">science of wisdom literature which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.259" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">the distinction between knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.780" end="00:07:45.169" style="s2">understanding and so the idea is and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.669" end="00:07:46.610" style="s2">knowledge has it as its normativity you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.169" end="00:07:49.130" style="s2">know as you said the standard</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.610" end="00:07:50.599" style="s2">normativity of truth especially when we</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.130" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">talk about propositional knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.599" end="00:07:55.569" style="s2">mean I think skills have power you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.529" style="s2">perspectives of presidents and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.569" end="00:08:00.710" style="s2">participatory knowing has affordance</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.529" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">connectedness but putting that aside the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.710" end="00:08:06.380" style="s2">difference between knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:08.449" style="s2">understanding is that understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.380" end="00:08:10.969" style="s2">it&#39;s emphasized and a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.449" end="00:08:13.490" style="s2">they keep their stand towards this but</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.969" end="00:08:17.719" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to unpack it has amended</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.490" end="00:08:20.449" style="s2">the challenge understanding is to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.719" end="00:08:22.789" style="s2">the significance of what you know which</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.449" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">immediately I have taken as you might</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.789" end="00:08:27.979" style="s2">expect to be what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:31.279" style="s2">grasping the relevance right grasping</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.979" end="00:08:34.760" style="s2">the relevance of it and as you say not</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.279" end="00:08:36.760" style="s2">in term just merely epistemic passion</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.760" end="00:08:39.409" style="s2">but grasping it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.760" end="00:08:41.479" style="s2">existentially relevance not in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.409" end="00:08:43.880" style="s2">of this is just interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.479" end="00:08:46.910" style="s2">relevance in well this is where I will</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.880" end="00:08:50.060" style="s2">commit my precious cognitive resources</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.910" end="00:08:51.840" style="s2">my precious time my precious</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.060" end="00:08:56.010" style="s2">relationships is this is where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.840" end="00:08:58.470" style="s2">I will you know I feel I have the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.010" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">chance the best bathroom a place in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.470" end="00:09:03.630" style="s2">commitment so it&#39;s grasping the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">significance and how it calls you into</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.630" end="00:09:08.610" style="s2">commitment so this is version ending and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.420" end="00:09:10.470" style="s2">so there&#39;s and there&#39;s and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.610" end="00:09:12.570" style="s2">parts to what&#39;s going on at</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.470" end="00:09:15.480" style="s2">understanding because I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.570" end="00:09:18.810" style="s2">understanding especially if you want it</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.480" end="00:09:20.700" style="s2">to have that dynamic coupling to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.810" end="00:09:22.350" style="s2">emergence that you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.700" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">all it&#39;s also going to be aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.350" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">aspiration because if you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:29.660" style="s2">called right and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:32.550" style="s2">understanding then if there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.660" end="00:09:33.960" style="s2">epistemic humility in your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.550" end="00:09:36.540" style="s2">relevance you&#39;re also understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.960" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">you do not yet drops what you do not yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.540" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">understand right usually the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">understanding the understanding should</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:44.700" style="s2">always be and this of course you know a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:46.110" style="s2">platonic theme it should always be on</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.700" end="00:09:49.380" style="s2">the horizon of wonder it should always</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.110" end="00:09:52.140" style="s2">be on the edge where you&#39;re right you</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:54.270" style="s2">you have the horizon intelligibility you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.140" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">see what you&#39;ve grasped but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.270" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">realizing right in a relevant manner</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:10:01.380" style="s2">what you have not yet grasped you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:04.620" style="s2">an inkling I think is a great term for</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.380" end="00:10:07.290" style="s2">it um so I think that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.620" end="00:10:09.720" style="s2">and then that brings up your second</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.290" end="00:10:12.210" style="s2">point I think because now we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.720" end="00:10:14.340" style="s2">about agency we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.210" end="00:10:16.530" style="s2">aspiration we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.340" end="00:10:18.780" style="s2">there&#39;s always this pairing when</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.530" end="00:10:20.340" style="s2">something is disclosed which it means</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.780" end="00:10:21.870" style="s2">more than I know it when something is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.340" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">disclosed everything apart eager here</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.870" end="00:10:26.970" style="s2">I&#39;m grasping it&#39;s significant and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a demand on there&#39;s a call to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.970" end="00:10:32.490" style="s2">that how I have to transform right in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:34.560" style="s2">order to come into proper relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.490" end="00:10:36.090" style="s2">with what&#39;s emerging and then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.560" end="00:10:39.210" style="s2">question of agency but you brought up</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.090" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">that I see the question of agency is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.210" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">know what the what kind of person do I</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:48.080" style="s2">have to be in order to stay in contact</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:53.190" style="s2">with this what&#39;s what what&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.080" end="00:10:57.030" style="s2">yeah yeah so let&#39;s um so imagine so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.190" end="00:10:59.970" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re in a so many crises is going</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.030" end="00:11:03.540" style="s2">on right now that may mean memmer eight</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.970" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">them is itself a crisis the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.540" end="00:11:07.980" style="s2">I was just noticing is the crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">information which is to say there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.980" end="00:11:12.690" style="s2">time when knowing stuff really mattered</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">a lot because it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.690" end="00:11:16.380" style="s2">know stuff and most people didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:17.490" style="s2">most stuff and so if you had certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.380" end="00:11:20.040" style="s2">stuff that you knew the other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.490" end="00:11:22.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that was valuable these days</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.040" end="00:11:24.690" style="s2">most stuff is already known by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.410" end="00:11:26.790" style="s2">internet and so it&#39;s a matter of finding</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.690" end="00:11:32.610" style="s2">it as it&#39;s much more important than</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.790" end="00:11:34.110" style="s2">knowing it and sorry the visual image I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.610" end="00:11:35.970" style="s2">have here is the thing I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.110" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">figure out how to express it so it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.970" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">the challenge is a challenge of learning</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:47.100" style="s2">how to dance through a perpetually</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:48.150" style="s2">changing space yes the the space of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.100" end="00:11:49.500" style="s2">could be known</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.150" end="00:11:54.330" style="s2">it&#39;s basically what is known as</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.500" end="00:11:56.790" style="s2">expanding exponentially and so there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.330" end="00:11:59.970" style="s2">no more power there is no more agency</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.790" end="00:12:01.650" style="s2">really to be had by simply to know stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.970" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">because it&#39;s whatever you know is a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.650" end="00:12:05.850" style="s2">territory of an expanding universe and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:08.340" style="s2">increasingly available to anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.850" end="00:12:10.860" style="s2">could in size the search for it so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.340" end="00:12:14.130" style="s2">the new center of agency is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.860" end="00:12:15.540" style="s2">capacity and gosh I wish I didn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.130" end="00:12:18.570" style="s2">lost the language you are using but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.540" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">this capacity to to to follow that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.570" end="00:12:25.170" style="s2">threat to just to flow with to unfold</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:28.050" style="s2">into a an expanding or a receding</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.170" end="00:12:30.990" style="s2">horizon and it&#39;s thirdly its</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.050" end="00:12:32.339" style="s2">skillfulness and I guess it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.990" end="00:12:33.900" style="s2">capacitor even a disposition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.339" end="00:12:36.510" style="s2">probably it it&#39;s the skillfulness of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.900" end="00:12:38.820" style="s2">capacity and his disposition to orient</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:40.950" style="s2">towards that perpetual renewal that</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.820" end="00:12:42.839" style="s2">moving into the newness that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.950" end="00:12:45.570" style="s2">happened and not to just sit here as The</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.839" end="00:12:47.670" style="s2">Horizon recedes but actually to sail</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.570" end="00:12:50.040" style="s2">with the horizon to turn the movement of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.670" end="00:12:52.140" style="s2">the horizon into a win the blows your</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.040" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">ship forward into that into that did</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.140" end="00:12:57.510" style="s2">that new place that&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:12:58.920" style="s2">different orientation a very different</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.510" end="00:13:02.520" style="s2">sensibility of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.920" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">I think the actually it was maybe a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.520" end="00:13:08.460" style="s2">more clarity to the kinds of to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:11.280" style="s2">essence of versus actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.460" end="00:13:13.110" style="s2">return back to birth yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.280" end="00:13:14.400" style="s2">it i think i think the term i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.110" end="00:13:16.290" style="s2">use what you&#39;re talking about I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.400" end="00:13:18.780" style="s2">think of a virtue I mean the original</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.290" end="00:13:19.170" style="s2">meaning is you know the power and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.780" end="00:13:23.820" style="s2">possib</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.170" end="00:13:26.910" style="s2">right virtue right it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.820" end="00:13:31.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a potency it&#39;s a potential that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.910" end="00:13:33.060" style="s2">ready to action right yeah so and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.079" end="00:13:35.639" style="s2">then what powers are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.060" end="00:13:37.980" style="s2">here I think you&#39;re talking about I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.639" end="00:13:40.320" style="s2">would call it like a sensibility in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.980" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">sensitivity to what&#39;s to significance</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.320" end="00:13:48.209" style="s2">like - like I said grasping what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">significant and then also you know there</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.209" end="00:13:55.079" style="s2">there&#39;s the way in which you honed that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:56.910" style="s2">to your ability to actually commit so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.079" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking more about these two sides</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.910" end="00:14:00.779" style="s2">like I said they&#39;re the sensing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:03.470" style="s2">significance and then taking it</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.779" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">seriously I&#39;m proposing this in fact as</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.470" end="00:14:08.339" style="s2">the kind of normativity we should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:10.019" style="s2">trying to use instead of the old</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.339" end="00:14:11.639" style="s2">normativity x&#39; we had foreknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.019" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">which were the normativity x&#39; of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.639" end="00:14:16.529" style="s2">certainty and probability yeah yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">what do we take seriously like which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.529" end="00:14:20.970" style="s2">not the same thing right so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:22.769" style="s2">exploring a lot this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.970" end="00:14:24.779" style="s2">plausibility there&#39;s two meanings of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.769" end="00:14:26.220" style="s2">plausibility one is just a synonym for</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.779" end="00:14:27.570" style="s2">highly probable that&#39;s not what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.220" end="00:14:29.490" style="s2">talking about there&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.570" end="00:14:30.750" style="s2">standard and people philosophers have</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.490" end="00:14:32.760" style="s2">been talking about this where</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.750" end="00:14:34.949" style="s2">plausibility means I take something</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.760" end="00:14:37.709" style="s2">seriously it&#39;s something that I will</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.949" end="00:14:39.690" style="s2">commit myself to I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.709" end="00:14:41.730" style="s2">true I&#39;m not even claiming it&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.690" end="00:14:44.430" style="s2">or even I&#39;m not even sure what its</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.730" end="00:14:46.110" style="s2">probabilities but what I&#39;m it&#39;s worthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.430" end="00:14:48.449" style="s2">of being taken seriously it has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.110" end="00:14:51.149" style="s2">significance which is to say that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.449" end="00:14:53.310" style="s2">that I will attend to it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.149" end="00:14:55.829" style="s2">I will venture into it I&#39;ll expand the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.310" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">most precious resource in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.829" end="00:15:00.449" style="s2">which is the finite amount of time that</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:02.100" style="s2">I am on this earth or renting myself in</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.449" end="00:15:04.199" style="s2">that direction which is okay that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.100" end="00:15:08.430" style="s2">ethical act that is that is the ethic</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.199" end="00:15:10.050" style="s2">laughs yeah I&#39;ll excuse that pass that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.430" end="00:15:12.120" style="s2">great and then let me just use a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.050" end="00:15:14.610" style="s2">different metaphor which is the knit</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.120" end="00:15:16.529" style="s2">metaphor of network because what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.610" end="00:15:19.170" style="s2">talking about is it is it is a in an</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.529" end="00:15:22.230" style="s2">Open Graph network the question for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">given node is what edges what edges</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.230" end="00:15:27.269" style="s2">shall be formed and what communication</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.260" end="00:15:28.470" style="s2">shall flow across those edges and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.269" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">question you&#39;re asking is that same</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.470" end="00:15:31.649" style="s2">question like what is this shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:32.970" style="s2">network so instead of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.649" end="00:15:35.130" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.970" end="00:15:36.660" style="s2">tenth of the network we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.130" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">talking about what is the topology of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.660" end="00:15:39.930" style="s2">the network exactly is the primary</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:43.350" style="s2">question yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.930" end="00:15:44.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t weigh that that little insight</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.350" end="00:15:46.290" style="s2">right there if you happen to be watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.550" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">this that&#39;s a very important one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.290" end="00:15:56.400" style="s2">a big insight I think so ultimately well</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:58.020" style="s2">two things first of all on that and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.400" end="00:16:01.110" style="s2">back on what you said about the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.020" end="00:16:02.910" style="s2">aspect of this I think that that inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.110" end="00:16:04.920" style="s2">I mean this is that sort of the core of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.910" end="00:16:06.870" style="s2">what I what I know what I take back I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.920" end="00:16:08.400" style="s2">think we also have to reconstruct is</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.870" end="00:16:11.490" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to do what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.400" end="00:16:12.900" style="s2">being rational and we don&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.490" end="00:16:16.260" style="s2">know we are not going to hold ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:18.090" style="s2">to the logical manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.260" end="00:16:20.250" style="s2">inferences because that&#39;s that&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.090" end="00:16:22.980" style="s2">the normativity of certainty or at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.250" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">with induction probability instead what</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.980" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">should rationality mean it should mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:30.060" style="s2">you know these fumes in the overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:34.020" style="s2">of self-deception as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.060" end="00:16:36.210" style="s2">and the affording of of you know of good</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.020" end="00:16:40.950" style="s2">connection as much as possible good</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.210" end="00:16:42.270" style="s2">connectedness and so what I was getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.950" end="00:16:45.390" style="s2">on there is that one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.270" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">insights that makes that new sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.390" end="00:16:51.210" style="s2">rationality possible is that rationality</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">is about shifting off our fixation on</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.210" end="00:16:57.450" style="s2">the products of our cognition and our</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:00.470" style="s2">communication and coming to take a deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.450" end="00:17:03.660" style="s2">interest and commitment to the process</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.470" end="00:17:06.150" style="s2">and so I I think with that insight that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.660" end="00:17:11.660" style="s2">you just mentioned of shifting right</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.150" end="00:17:14.850" style="s2">from the content to apology I think is I</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.660" end="00:17:17.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s consonant with you know this</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.850" end="00:17:19.650" style="s2">and I think it has to be you know if</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.550" end="00:17:21.810" style="s2">we&#39;re if we&#39;re going to be reformulating</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.650" end="00:17:24.510" style="s2">education we have to be reformulating</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.810" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">what rationality means and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.510" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">to know what you know the rationality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:32.580" style="s2">plausibility as I&#39;m using it to mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:35.850" style="s2">that virtue of properly sensing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.580" end="00:17:37.620" style="s2">significance and taking seriously in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.850" end="00:17:41.100" style="s2">appropriate a wise manner I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.620" end="00:17:42.810" style="s2">what what that looks like and then back</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.100" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">to the point then that you started with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.810" end="00:17:46.680" style="s2">I agree with you and this comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:49.020" style="s2">iris Murdoch&#39;s the sovereignty of good</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.680" end="00:17:52.200" style="s2">the primary ethical act is the act of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.020" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">paying attention giving things their due</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.200" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">attention which is exactly what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.440" style="s2">talking about in my giving things the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:00.270" style="s2">attention they deserve</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.440" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">this isn&#39;t this is a different</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.270" end="00:18:06.450" style="s2">conception of justice it&#39;s giving things</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:08.220" style="s2">you know adjust attention just the right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.450" end="00:18:10.620" style="s2">amount of attention I&#39;m playing with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.220" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">word just right but that&#39;s what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.620" end="00:18:14.190" style="s2">talking about in the sovereignty of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.470" style="s2">good and so I think this isn&#39;t my thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.190" end="00:18:19.410" style="s2">this is a deeply important virtue that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.470" end="00:18:21.210" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to zero in on it you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.410" end="00:18:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s got up its got some rationality</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.210" end="00:18:26.550" style="s2">it&#39;s got sensibility it&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.040" end="00:18:28.890" style="s2">potency of of being able to commit and</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.550" end="00:18:33.660" style="s2">take seriously I think this is all</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.420" end="00:19:21.300" style="s2">around doctrine I probably have a</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.490" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">right so the way that you are successful</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.560" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">between ordinary forces modes is you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:56.610" style="s2">have a plan and that plan is a</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.950" end="00:22:37.860" style="s2">might the new normal is not work</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.970" end="00:22:40.020" style="s2">temporarily special fortunes then return</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.860" end="00:22:42.419" style="s2">back to actuality but rather the new</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.020" end="00:22:45.299" style="s2">normal is we ought to become agents of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.419" end="00:22:47.159" style="s2">that kind we all become sort of Omni</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.299" end="00:22:49.710" style="s2">Navy SEALs who can be in any environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.159" end="00:22:52.470" style="s2">and can adapt fluidly and adaptively to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.710" end="00:22:54.570" style="s2">continuous change because remember not</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.470" end="00:22:56.789" style="s2">only have we learned the hard lesson</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.570" end="00:23:00.360" style="s2">that an over reliance on optimization is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.789" end="00:23:03.149" style="s2">an unwise choice but also recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.360" end="00:23:05.159" style="s2">we are on a very nonlinear path this</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.149" end="00:23:08.730" style="s2">accelerating change the technology that</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.149" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">just change the world it changes the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.730" end="00:23:18.840" style="s2">rate of change yeah so the world is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:20.549" style="s2">going to continue to be one where to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.840" end="00:23:23.190" style="s2">Special Forces is the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.549" end="00:23:27.390" style="s2">survive so I&#39;d like to throw those into</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.190" end="00:23:29.429" style="s2">the into the I love that I love that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.390" end="00:23:34.649" style="s2">mean that so that the martial art</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.429" end="00:23:39.000" style="s2">metaphors often come to my mind too and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.649" end="00:23:41.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s a couple things here one is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.000" end="00:23:42.600" style="s2">know you&#39;re familiar with it and no in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.190" end="00:23:44.279" style="s2">the model that I&#39;ve worked out with Tim</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.600" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">little Cobb and Blake Richards and Leo</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.279" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">Ferraro relevance realization was</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">constantly trading between efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">and resiliency and and we push as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">say I think we&#39;ve pushed too far into</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:59.669" style="s2">efficiency and planning and we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">resiliency and coping we so our coping</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.669" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">abilities are very untrained very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:07.140" style="s2">hungry because what we&#39;ve tried to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:10.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve tried to make everything I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.140" end="00:24:13.409" style="s2">it&#39;s both efficiency and also a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.220" end="00:24:14.970" style="s2">security and those are often outlined</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.409" end="00:24:17.370" style="s2">together this goes back to the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.970" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">stability what we&#39;re trying to do is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.370" end="00:24:22.039" style="s2">know can we can we get things as</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:25.649" style="s2">efficiently non-challenging as possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.039" end="00:24:26.980" style="s2">if I could put it that way and so coping</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.649" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.980" end="00:24:33.100" style="s2">the thing about the thing about coping</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:35.190" style="s2">and the special forces is especially you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.100" end="00:24:38.860" style="s2">you have to get into a state of mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.190" end="00:24:40.450" style="s2">where you are which doesn&#39;t feel very</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.860" end="00:24:42.580" style="s2">efficient because what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.450" end="00:24:45.160" style="s2">you have to keep various options alive</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.580" end="00:24:47.410" style="s2">at the same time you have to have a form</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.160" end="00:24:49.630" style="s2">of thinking even when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.410" end="00:24:51.430" style="s2">notice how we&#39;re doing this we like</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.630" end="00:24:53.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not just getting to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.430" end="00:24:55.300" style="s2">line what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re throwing</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.320" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">out and we&#39;re keeping multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.300" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">alive multiple options multiple ways in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.970" end="00:25:04.030" style="s2">which things can go and where it will</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.940" end="00:25:05.980" style="s2">compress towards some convergence but</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.030" end="00:25:07.900" style="s2">then we&#39;ll open it up again and we&#39;ll oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.980" end="00:25:09.880" style="s2">right and we keep this is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.900" end="00:25:10.900" style="s2">learning cycle which I think is this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.880" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">what we&#39;re coming out of machine</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.900" end="00:25:14.500" style="s2">learning this is how you make a system</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:16.360" style="s2">really get at coping really good at</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.500" end="00:25:18.580" style="s2">making it more adaptive you constantly</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.360" end="00:25:20.800" style="s2">cycling we do yes we do gather together</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.580" end="00:25:23.230" style="s2">we come to convergence you know because</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.800" end="00:25:26.380" style="s2">we have to have points right but at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.230" end="00:25:28.690" style="s2">same time where we are also committed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.380" end="00:25:30.820" style="s2">the resilience we&#39;re committed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.690" end="00:25:32.620" style="s2">keeping the options open keeping them</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.820" end="00:25:36.070" style="s2">live and what&#39;s really interesting if</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.620" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">you take a look and this is another riff</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.070" end="00:25:42.070" style="s2">in our culture we have tended to put</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:44.260" style="s2">aside older people because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.070" end="00:25:45.820" style="s2">have efficient working memory and so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.260" end="00:25:47.830" style="s2">give them all these tests about how fast</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.820" end="00:25:50.770" style="s2">can they come to a conclusion how</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.830" end="00:25:54.280" style="s2">quickly can they get the correct answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.770" end="00:25:57.010" style="s2">and they&#39;re say I&#39;ll look the decline</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.280" end="00:25:59.710" style="s2">but what Lin has showed is yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.010" end="00:26:01.720" style="s2">know what&#39;s wrong with older brains they</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.710" end="00:26:03.970" style="s2">keep many more things as potentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.720" end="00:26:05.890" style="s2">relevant live that&#39;s why they seem so</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.970" end="00:26:07.930" style="s2">distracted that&#39;s why it&#39;s harder for</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.890" end="00:26:09.910" style="s2">them to come to a conclusion and when</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.930" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">you give them a well-defined problem yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.910" end="00:26:14.500" style="s2">you out-compete them but if you put you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:18.550" style="s2">and them into an ill-defined problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.500" end="00:26:22.270" style="s2">they out-compete you right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.550" end="00:26:24.850" style="s2">user culture and all of that is also and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.270" end="00:26:26.890" style="s2">you know part of the way in which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.850" end="00:26:30.730" style="s2">enacted this you know the way we</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.890" end="00:26:32.440" style="s2">marginalize and exclude the elderly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.730" end="00:26:35.800" style="s2">we there they are just diminished</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.440" end="00:26:38.440" style="s2">versions of us and so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.800" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">also important that we we start to</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.440" end="00:26:42.920" style="s2">remember coping</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:03.950" style="s2">cognition should be operating mmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:06.740" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something really how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.950" end="00:27:08.210" style="s2">I say this yeah I I&#39;m I&#39;m aware of I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.750" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">speed you&#39;re optimizing for quick</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.929" end="00:27:30.140" style="s2">quickness and rapid computation now</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">you&#39;re just users taking information and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.140" end="00:27:35.450" style="s2">processing it quickly and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.010" end="00:27:40.280" style="s2">different thing that happens when you</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.280" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">yeah I guess I got wrote about a little</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.270" end="00:28:05.690" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s not as obvious you could</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.309" end="00:28:08.540" style="s2">tell if you immersed yourself in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.690" end="00:28:11.390" style="s2">felt the weight of it and I see this</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.540" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">also with a certain set of personality</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.390" end="00:28:19.100" style="s2">types it&#39;s not necessary strictly age</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:21.020" style="s2">not create my wife for example it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.100" end="00:28:22.790" style="s2">great relief and revelation for her to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.020" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">realize that she was what is known as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.790" end="00:28:29.240" style="s2">slow processor and I would refer to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:32.299" style="s2">hey take the time you need to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.240" end="00:28:34.730" style="s2">because my experience is that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.299" end="00:28:39.020" style="s2">comes out of your process will always be</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.730" end="00:28:40.730" style="s2">better I rely on that and so if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.020" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">we&#39;re in a situation we have it coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.730" end="00:28:47.150" style="s2">between an OK solution rapidly is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:48.500" style="s2">thing I&#39;ll take that I can get us to 85</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.150" end="00:28:51.559" style="s2">percent of the right answer almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.500" end="00:28:53.150" style="s2">instantaneously but if it&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.559" end="00:28:54.500" style="s2">actually get a really good answer</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.150" end="00:28:57.890" style="s2">then take the time</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.500" end="00:28:59.870" style="s2">today and over and over again that has</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.890" end="00:29:01.400" style="s2">worked really well it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.870" end="00:29:04.430" style="s2">interesting to like just away like her</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.400" end="00:29:06.110" style="s2">whole mood now and will clearly be</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.430" end="00:29:08.690" style="s2">operating like nine or ten different</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.110" end="00:29:10.310" style="s2">modes of knowing and then each one to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.690" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">kind of do its thing and then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.310" end="00:29:14.750" style="s2">like doing it again in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:16.340" style="s2">and she&#39;ll well you know work on arch or</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.750" end="00:29:18.110" style="s2">she&#39;ll go for long walks or she&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.340" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">cooking I should be talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.110" end="00:29:21.650" style="s2">she&#39;s just processing it all over the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:24.140" style="s2">plates but when something finally</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.650" end="00:29:25.580" style="s2">becomes clear it&#39;s solid and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.140" end="00:29:28.670" style="s2">something can be used to build stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.580" end="00:29:33.530" style="s2">with well so there&#39;s two things I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.670" end="00:29:35.570" style="s2">to say that because right one is like so</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.530" end="00:29:36.350" style="s2">this is educating for virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.570" end="00:29:39.590" style="s2">adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.350" end="00:29:42.590" style="s2">maybe we can put it together right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.590" end="00:29:44.630" style="s2">then and add activity shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.590" end="00:29:47.420" style="s2">confused or equated to speed of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.630" end="00:29:49.460" style="s2">reactivity this is an again a martial</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.420" end="00:29:51.950" style="s2">art thing like the first you know you</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.460" end="00:29:53.750" style="s2">got one faster yeah I wanted fast reflex</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.950" end="00:29:56.690" style="s2">no you don&#39;t you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.750" end="00:29:58.820" style="s2">spontaneous responses spontaneous</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.690" end="00:30:01.490" style="s2">responses are ones in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.820" end="00:30:05.120" style="s2">intervene and you can finesse the move</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.490" end="00:30:07.340" style="s2">if you just not fast reflexes right you</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.120" end="00:30:09.860" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.340" end="00:30:11.900" style="s2">but if if I if I&#39;m just about to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.860" end="00:30:14.180" style="s2">the punch right and I decide no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.900" end="00:30:16.910" style="s2">going to flip it like this right um</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.180" end="00:30:19.100" style="s2">right go around something that you just</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.910" end="00:30:20.990" style="s2">put up at the last second then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.100" end="00:30:22.700" style="s2">what we&#39;re after we&#39;re after so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.990" end="00:30:24.980" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be confusing I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.700" end="00:30:27.020" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be confusing adaptivity with</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.980" end="00:30:29.540" style="s2">speed of reckoning we should be we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.020" end="00:30:33.050" style="s2">should bring bringing out finesse and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.540" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">then I wanted to bring out what I I</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.050" end="00:30:38.810" style="s2">think your you know your wife</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:42.590" style="s2">exemplifies I think um I hope this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.810" end="00:30:45.080" style="s2">taken correctly because I I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.590" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">to use masculine and feminine I try to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.080" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">use Yang and Yin because masculine</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:53.990" style="s2">feminine are so politicized but the yin</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:56.050" style="s2">way of doing things is much more about</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.990" end="00:31:00.260" style="s2">that it&#39;s much more about deepening</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.050" end="00:31:03.530" style="s2">right the resources of resilience before</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.260" end="00:31:07.340" style="s2">you respond rather than striking out so</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.530" end="00:31:08.179" style="s2">like right and and so you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.340" end="00:31:09.619" style="s2">think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.179" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">also be bringing in more of the in</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.619" end="00:31:18.049" style="s2">aspect into our understanding of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:23.240" style="s2">educational project absolutely and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.049" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">yeah so kind of to loop back to an</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.240" end="00:31:28.879" style="s2">earlier thread but also to expand it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:31.610" style="s2">is your educational project oriented</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.879" end="00:31:34.580" style="s2">towards training managers to run a</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.610" end="00:31:38.059" style="s2">culture that somebody else built right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.580" end="00:31:40.970" style="s2">or is it in giving capacity to give</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.059" end="00:31:43.519" style="s2">people responsibility for continually</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.970" end="00:31:45.320" style="s2">renewing and constructing the culture</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:47.230" style="s2">that they themselves are living in and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.320" end="00:31:50.450" style="s2">are passing down those are just</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.230" end="00:31:55.309" style="s2">different those are completely different</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.450" end="00:31:57.860" style="s2">intents and obviously the ladder is how</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.309" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">he builds up to the last and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.860" end="00:32:03.139" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting how we seem to</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:07.419" style="s2">really fallen into a universal pitfall</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.139" end="00:32:10.789" style="s2">of becoming the former becoming to which</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.419" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">of the former evaporate managers to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.789" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">manage a culture that was built by other</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:16.879" style="s2">people many of whom were in fact no</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:19.970" style="s2">longer alive so they&#39;re even how why or</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.879" end="00:32:22.249" style="s2">what it was the basis it&#39;s just a weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.970" end="00:32:23.779" style="s2">place that we find ourselves in but all</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.249" end="00:32:26.210" style="s2">of the capacities that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.779" end="00:32:28.999" style="s2">talking about know that we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.210" end="00:32:31.700" style="s2">been talking about in this dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.999" end="00:32:32.899" style="s2">show up in this other mode this way they</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.700" end="00:32:38.330" style="s2">were talking about it like the special</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.899" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">forces approach fluid response have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.330" end="00:32:45.830" style="s2">do with responsibility yes yes you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:49.490" style="s2">not you are not merely managing</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.830" end="00:32:52.759" style="s2">something you are building it you are</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.490" end="00:32:57.980" style="s2">responsible for it how funny one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.759" end="00:33:03.350" style="s2">things I&#39;ve noticed is uh public spaces</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.980" end="00:33:06.649" style="s2">in society are usually really sad like</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.350" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">you go to a public park there&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.649" end="00:33:13.450" style="s2">trash in the public park right really</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.450" style="s2">really really high functioning</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:18.889" style="s2">extremists in there it&#39;s not the best</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.450" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">whereas often times if you go to a place</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.889" end="00:33:21.650" style="s2">that is held by people who have who live</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.890" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.650" end="00:33:26.300" style="s2">the what&#39;s the phrase like I remember in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.890" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">school the teacher would say something</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.300" end="00:33:28.850" style="s2">like would you do that in your own house</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:30.620" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.850" end="00:33:31.910" style="s2">the answer of course is no obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.620" end="00:33:34.190" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t just throw my trash on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.910" end="00:33:38.630" style="s2">ground in my own house or if I if I did</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.190" end="00:33:41.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not a civic person my mother a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.630" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">mature person and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.120" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">about that but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:46.340" style="s2">if I live in a culture that is not my</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.390" end="00:33:47.570" style="s2">own culture and I&#39;m merely managing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.340" end="00:33:49.370" style="s2">and I&#39;m paying other people to take</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.570" end="00:33:50.510" style="s2">responsibility for functions and their</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.370" end="00:33:52.070" style="s2">each kind of playing a managerial role</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.510" end="00:33:55.970" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.070" end="00:33:58.220" style="s2">indifference or a feeling it&#39;s the okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.970" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">to not take care of it whereas if I</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.220" end="00:34:02.350" style="s2">actually am responsible for it one I</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.130" end="00:34:04.160" style="s2">feel the burden of that responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.350" end="00:34:06.380" style="s2">but then of course I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.160" end="00:34:08.090" style="s2">responsibility for it if I have agency</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.380" end="00:34:09.800" style="s2">to be responsible then you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.090" end="00:34:11.030" style="s2">vital culture that renews it something</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.800" end="00:34:13.159" style="s2">keeps itself clean it picks up its own</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.030" end="00:34:14.570" style="s2">trash and you know repairs it&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.159" end="00:34:15.620" style="s2">and infrastructure and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.570" end="00:34:21.980" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.620" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">that was a good I think that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.980" end="00:34:29.840" style="s2">the idea of I mean yeah you&#39;re right it</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:31.700" style="s2">creates a distancing it creates an I hit</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.840" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">relationship with things rather than an</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.700" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">eye though and I like the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.320" style="s2">picking up on the ability to respond but</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.490" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">also again as you said the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.320" end="00:34:48.919" style="s2">component of responsibility treating</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:51.770" style="s2">things the way they deserve to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.919" end="00:34:54.860" style="s2">treated which means firstly and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.770" end="00:34:56.899" style="s2">attending to them in the way they meet</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.860" end="00:35:00.470" style="s2">right giving them the time giving them</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.899" end="00:35:05.080" style="s2">their the cognitive space yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.470" end="00:35:07.310" style="s2">so what I&#39;m wondering also if this and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.080" end="00:35:09.110" style="s2">you know more about this than I do but</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.310" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">Zack and I we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.110" end="00:35:17.450" style="s2">about trying to move the normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:19.220" style="s2">education off beings wholly focused sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.450" end="00:35:21.080" style="s2">of on the market we&#39;re talking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.220" end="00:35:24.140" style="s2">about culture here and one of the death</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.080" end="00:35:28.070" style="s2">holding crisis is reminding us is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.140" end="00:35:30.020" style="s2">you know I think Thomas B Orman is right</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.070" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of gotten down to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.020" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">de-facto normativity for us is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:36.690" style="s2">market but what we&#39;re realizing is no no</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:38.490" style="s2">that actually sticks within culture and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.690" end="00:35:40.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to remember that and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.490" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">culture ultimately sits within the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.380" end="00:35:44.940" style="s2">environment the ecology and and if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:46.020" style="s2">don&#39;t get that back word we&#39;re screwed</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:50.070" style="s2">we&#39;re in deep trouble</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.020" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">so what that comes up to my mind given</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.070" end="00:35:54.570" style="s2">what I just said and given what you said</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:57.030" style="s2">is that is you know broadening the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.570" end="00:36:00.840" style="s2">notion of responsibility beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.030" end="00:36:03.780" style="s2">which I own because that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.840" end="00:36:05.369" style="s2">talking about well as when I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.780" end="00:36:07.619" style="s2">to people about it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.369" end="00:36:12.420" style="s2">different here in Canada our parks are</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.619" end="00:36:14.970" style="s2">usually trash free but because because</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:17.460" style="s2">you know we negotiated our independence</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.970" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">we didn&#39;t have a revolution right by the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.460" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">way are the trash free because the parks</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:24.570" style="s2">are well funded and have lots of paid</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:26.570" style="s2">people who clean it up or because the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.570" end="00:36:32.130" style="s2">people in the parks clean up the parks</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.570" end="00:36:34.590" style="s2">so both so both there is you they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.130" end="00:36:36.570" style="s2">well funded that people with and there</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.590" end="00:36:39.089" style="s2">isn&#39;t an objection to that people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.570" end="00:36:41.810" style="s2">say no I don&#39;t want that I don&#39;t own the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.089" end="00:36:44.970" style="s2">park so I don&#39;t want to fund it right</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.810" end="00:36:47.609" style="s2">there&#39;s not that I mean we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.970" end="00:36:49.170" style="s2">about an ideal contrast obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.609" end="00:36:51.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a continuum here between the two</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.170" end="00:36:54.270" style="s2">countries so I hope that&#39;s understood</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.570" end="00:36:56.070" style="s2">but also if I were to just be in a park</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.270" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">and throw trash on the ground there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.070" end="00:36:59.310" style="s2">very good chance somebody would say what</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:02.460" style="s2">are you doing what are you doing are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.310" end="00:37:04.740" style="s2">doing my right right and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.460" end="00:37:06.390" style="s2">I mean about the sense of that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.740" end="00:37:08.369" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s born of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.390" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">participation you know I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.369" end="00:37:13.380" style="s2">enculturation which is different than</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:15.869" style="s2">the responsibility that is born out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.380" end="00:37:18.540" style="s2">ownership right and the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.869" end="00:37:20.730" style="s2">interacting with market forces I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.540" end="00:37:23.250" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m not a Marxist I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.730" end="00:37:24.599" style="s2">saying oh you&#39;re away with the marker</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.250" end="00:37:28.349" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.599" end="00:37:30.839" style="s2">say again we have to situate our</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.349" end="00:37:31.770" style="s2">normativity back into what I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.839" end="00:37:33.690" style="s2">you&#39;re putting your finger on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.770" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">naughty in fact I want to say it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.690" end="00:37:38.780" style="s2">in the process of enculturation it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:42.180" style="s2">process of continually evolving</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.780" end="00:37:43.740" style="s2">inculturation that right what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.180" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">talking about here that&#39;s exactly it</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.740" end="00:37:47.580" style="s2">exactly and so so it&#39;s this rewind a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:47.940" style="s2">little bit and then come back from there</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.580" end="00:37:49.410" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.940" end="00:37:51.270" style="s2">what I would say is I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.410" end="00:37:54.330" style="s2">proposition that you previously making</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.270" end="00:37:59.490" style="s2">is the exact opposite of Marxist right</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.330" end="00:38:01.830" style="s2">okay what Marx Marxism does wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.490" end="00:38:03.720" style="s2">I can&#39;t think the same as its category</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.830" end="00:38:07.910" style="s2">error and it&#39;s interesting like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.720" end="00:38:10.530" style="s2">exactly the wrong direction is alienates</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.910" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">everyone from responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.530" end="00:38:15.990" style="s2">culture I turn to higher culture into</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.890" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">management so I&#39;d like what I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.990" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">propose if I can present this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.580" end="00:38:21.390" style="s2">management this notion of managing</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.910" style="s2">something that you do not have</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.390" end="00:38:25.470" style="s2">responsibility for then it&#39;s not yours</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.910" end="00:38:27.930" style="s2">like if I&#39;m managing a company right the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.470" end="00:38:29.510" style="s2">shareholders own it and I manage it like</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.930" end="00:38:34.200" style="s2">that relationality that alienation</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.510" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">that&#39;s this term right yet Marxism is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.200" end="00:38:38.520" style="s2">does that instead of getting rid of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:40.110" style="s2">it actually makes that ubiquitous I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.520" end="00:38:44.100" style="s2">not a lien ated for everything the state</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.110" end="00:38:46.140" style="s2">runs everything and nobody our managers</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.100" end="00:38:47.970" style="s2">right we&#39;re all managers which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.140" end="00:38:49.290" style="s2">exactly the worst you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.970" end="00:38:50.790" style="s2">pointing in the exact opposite direction</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.290" end="00:38:53.640" style="s2">which is just say okay well how come you</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.790" end="00:38:56.370" style="s2">can we create a context and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.640" end="00:38:58.980" style="s2">what I want to say here is is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.370" end="00:39:01.470" style="s2">crucial that we not load people with</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.980" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">responsibility but it&#39;s not theirs to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.470" end="00:39:08.010" style="s2">carry and I say cannot carry right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:10.710" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not suggesting that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.010" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">suggesting is a continuous process of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.710" end="00:39:16.680" style="s2">empowering people to be able to a take</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:18.840" style="s2">more responsibility and B to discern</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.680" end="00:39:20.430" style="s2">what responsibility is theirs and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.840" end="00:39:25.080" style="s2">take it right so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.430" end="00:39:27.030" style="s2">three distinct things yes yes and this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.080" end="00:39:29.570" style="s2">that that triad those three elements</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.030" end="00:39:33.810" style="s2">that empowerment discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.570" end="00:39:37.560" style="s2">responsibility mesh together into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.810" end="00:39:39.080" style="s2">culture that is a volatile and culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.560" end="00:39:42.650" style="s2">and this is a culture that is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.080" end="00:39:45.000" style="s2">attached to what it is but rather is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.650" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">empowered in image what it is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.000" end="00:39:50.010" style="s2">and is always living forward to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:51.630" style="s2">exceeding horizon and this is again so</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.010" end="00:39:54.120" style="s2">now we did at the individual level or</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.630" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">the individual level having expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.120" end="00:39:57.660" style="s2">now an extinction event because the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:40:00.270" style="s2">thing you&#39;re an expert in is becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.660" end="00:40:01.730" style="s2">commodity and irrelevant having</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:41:00.440" style="s2">long-standing critique of Marxism that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">it was just as bad as capitalism at</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.440" end="00:41:10.820" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about shared</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.080" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">presuppositions that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.820" end="00:41:16.760" style="s2">challenged across the board there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.980" style="s2">other ways here&#39;s a here&#39;s a throwaway</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.780" end="00:41:24.890" style="s2">but the critique I had a feminism is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.280" end="00:41:26.690" style="s2">this there was a point at which feminism</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.890" end="00:41:28.940" style="s2">could have chosen to liberate all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.690" end="00:41:30.560" style="s2">from shitty jobs but instead we decided</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.940" end="00:41:33.730" style="s2">to do is to have all of us men men and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.560" end="00:41:36.710" style="s2">women included both equal in shitty jobs</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:38.780" style="s2">like boy gosh the road not taken&#39; in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.710" end="00:41:40.460" style="s2">1972 we&#39;ve been asked if we could have</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.780" end="00:41:42.050" style="s2">picked me on the road now we&#39;d all be</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.460" end="00:41:43.340" style="s2">sitting with none of us being in shitty</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.050" end="00:41:43.720" style="s2">jobs we&#39;ve been a really better place to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.340" end="00:41:47.450" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.720" end="00:41:48.740" style="s2">well why it became and I get it was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">path dependency on history and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.740" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">possibility and consciousness but how it</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:56.420" style="s2">became the thing that the virtue is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:42:00.200" style="s2">become a director of marketing at a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.420" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">Madison Avenue advertising firm is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.200" end="00:42:06.680" style="s2">interesting case study of how bad people</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.390" end="00:42:08.630" style="s2">can lead on the wrong path yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.680" end="00:42:10.840" style="s2">specifically casting aspersions at all</p>

<p begin="00:42:10.840" end="00:42:19.580" style="s2">I think that so</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.500" end="00:42:22.550" style="s2">so I want to try and get the I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.580" end="00:42:25.100" style="s2">proper these theoretical interface</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.550" end="00:42:26.240" style="s2">between we&#39;ve got these two levels of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.100" end="00:42:29.870" style="s2">scale we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.240" end="00:42:31.700" style="s2">about sort of you know how education</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.870" end="00:42:35.090" style="s2">being oriented towards evolving and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.700" end="00:42:37.580" style="s2">culturation and odd activity and then we</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.090" end="00:42:42.520" style="s2">said that that&#39;s going to give giving</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.580" end="00:42:45.380" style="s2">people the virtue of you know adaptivity</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.520" end="00:42:47.480" style="s2">sensing what&#39;s significant being able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.380" end="00:42:50.150" style="s2">take serious being able to commit</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.480" end="00:42:51.140" style="s2">themselves you know a sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.150" end="00:42:53.240" style="s2">and you know I&#39;ve talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.140" end="00:42:55.220" style="s2">before a sense of the course of things</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.240" end="00:42:57.950" style="s2">we when we have a discussion about faith</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.220" end="00:43:00.890" style="s2">right then that virtue of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.950" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">you know I wear like the way your</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.890" end="00:43:05.330" style="s2">faithful to your wife you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:07.370" style="s2">don&#39;t try and get I&#39;m gonna try to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.330" end="00:43:09.320" style="s2">my optimal set of beliefs about my life</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.370" end="00:43:11.150" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna try and get that so I can</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.320" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">manage her appropriately because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.150" end="00:43:15.320" style="s2">a disaster right now about to happen but</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:18.290" style="s2">instead what you mean is faithfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.320" end="00:43:21.020" style="s2">I&#39;m going to try and cultivate a potency</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.290" end="00:43:24.350" style="s2">a resiliency so that I can adapt and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.020" end="00:43:28.400" style="s2">stay in continuity of contact with her</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.350" end="00:43:30.680" style="s2">as she changes I can maintain you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.400" end="00:43:33.470" style="s2">the continuity of the contact in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.680" end="00:43:36.140" style="s2">relationship I can constantly evolve as</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.470" end="00:43:37.880" style="s2">and afford how she was unfolding so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.140" end="00:43:41.390" style="s2">notion of faithfulness as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.880" end="00:43:43.640" style="s2">closure or management and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.390" end="00:43:45.290" style="s2">bridge from there over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.640" end="00:43:46.970" style="s2">that dichotomy I think just continues to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.290" end="00:43:49.670" style="s2">come up and we can just build a fluidity</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.970" end="00:43:51.530" style="s2">of noticing okay to what degree am I on</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.670" end="00:43:53.330" style="s2">this path of the closure into whipped</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.530" end="00:43:55.130" style="s2">cream on this path of reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.330" end="00:43:57.290" style="s2">yes it&#39;s just after every time in every</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:43:59.180" style="s2">location yeah exactly there was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.290" end="00:44:02.780" style="s2">the sensitivity towards reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.180" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">opening and so again I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.780" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">Enterprise right I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:12.020" style="s2">want to say social engineering because I</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.190" end="00:44:14.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s the managerial frame of</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.020" end="00:44:18.230" style="s2">mind but what would that need for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.840" end="00:44:20.390" style="s2">disposition of resources and you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.230" end="00:44:23.540" style="s2">the structuring of institutions that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.390" end="00:44:24.770" style="s2">used to call education what would it no</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.540" end="00:44:27.230" style="s2">pun intended but what would that mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.770" end="00:44:29.339" style="s2">concretely about that right these are we</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.230" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">D centralizing education</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.339" end="00:44:33.779" style="s2">what does it mean you know we try to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:37.349" style="s2">something like okay in the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.779" end="00:44:40.349" style="s2">without me go ahead so should try this</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.349" end="00:44:43.229" style="s2">is a really sweet use of a phrase</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.349" end="00:44:46.799" style="s2">inverted so you talked about from one</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.229" end="00:44:50.099" style="s2">direction this notion of giving the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.799" end="00:44:54.630" style="s2">attention that is just yes yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.099" end="00:44:57.749" style="s2">flip it around imagine the child is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.630" end="00:44:59.009" style="s2">object that thing that phenomenon to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.749" end="00:45:01.739" style="s2">which we are endeavoring to give the</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.009" end="00:45:03.299" style="s2">attention that is just yeah all right</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.739" end="00:45:06.359" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be a core principle of any</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.299" end="00:45:08.849" style="s2">future any new education system how do I</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.359" end="00:45:12.180" style="s2">truly attend to this being this</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.849" end="00:45:13.650" style="s2">unfolding beingness how do I have faith</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.180" end="00:45:14.819" style="s2">how do I operate in good faith in</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.650" end="00:45:17.279" style="s2">relationship with that with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.819" end="00:45:19.979" style="s2">developing human any education system</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.279" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">worth its salt must operate in that way</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.979" end="00:45:24.359" style="s2">right so I can immediately now show how</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.319" end="00:45:26.460" style="s2">our current education system fails it</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.359" end="00:45:28.619" style="s2">does not do that it does not give the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.460" end="00:45:31.109" style="s2">child the attention to this is their due</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.619" end="00:45:33.299" style="s2">it gives the child the you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.109" end="00:45:35.960" style="s2">cookie cutter represent repetitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.299" end="00:45:38.999" style="s2">attention is available in a scalable</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.960" end="00:45:40.619" style="s2">hierarchical system where the only way</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.999" end="00:45:42.299" style="s2">to give any attention at all is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.619" end="00:45:44.579" style="s2">repeat and none of it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.299" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">what is do so one of course is to work</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.579" end="00:45:48.900" style="s2">to invert it is bus boat it is for sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:49.859" style="s2">this book and it&#39;s just same we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.229" end="00:45:55.829" style="s2">so any educational system that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:58.019" style="s2">violent of the future must always take</p>

<p begin="00:46:06.479" end="00:46:11.009" style="s2">all right now this is how you do meta</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.269" end="00:46:13.289" style="s2">design by the way I&#39;m going to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.009" end="00:46:14.130" style="s2">describing what is necessary now if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.289" end="00:46:17.489" style="s2">sounds hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.130" end="00:46:18.630" style="s2">oh well do bad it&#39;s necessary so we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.489" end="00:46:20.190" style="s2">to work backwards and figure out how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.630" end="00:46:21.479" style="s2">get that and how we get better at it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.190" end="00:46:22.799" style="s2">by the way it may be a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.479" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">generations before we can pull off what</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.799" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">I just described again we&#39;re working for</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:29.700" style="s2">meta design then we&#39;ll work on design so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:31.979" style="s2">the meta design is we are always going</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">the production values aren&#39;t as great</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.690" end="00:50:39.450" style="s2">but you know he&#39;s he&#39;s willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">aside all of that because he&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.450" end="00:50:44.730" style="s2">like he&#39;s getting that sense of you know</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.090" end="00:50:55.740" style="s2">was thinking yeah what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.580" end="00:50:58.560" style="s2">that you know for all the stuff I teach</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.740" end="00:51:00.150" style="s2">him sharing this with him and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.560" end="00:51:02.100" style="s2">going through it together is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.150" end="00:51:03.480" style="s2">kind of thing you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.100" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">kind of this it&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.480" end="00:51:08.310" style="s2">intersection between you know apprentice</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.340" end="00:51:22.950" style="s2">affording me seeing something that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:26.340" style="s2">thought I do you know in a renewed way</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.950" end="00:51:28.830" style="s2">right away powerful what yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.340" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s um you glued together the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.830" end="00:51:31.800" style="s2">term spirituality education I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:34.770" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be a minimum requirement</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.800" end="00:51:37.530" style="s2">right right you need to make those terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.770" end="00:51:39.660" style="s2">become education is spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.530" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">or something along those lines and an</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.660" end="00:51:43.080" style="s2">insight I think that comes from that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:46.550" style="s2">to recognize that it is always symmetric</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.080" end="00:51:51.020" style="s2">that you know if I&#39;m interacting with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.550" end="00:51:54.030" style="s2">three-year-old and there is a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.020" end="00:51:56.040" style="s2">educative in that moment it is fully</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.030" end="00:51:59.130" style="s2">symmetric right I&#39;m in learning as much</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.040" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">as I&#39;m teaching and how I&#39;m not open to</p>

<p begin="00:52:04.950" end="00:52:10.620" style="s2">yes nor my a good learner right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.940" end="00:52:13.730" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s one piece the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.620" end="00:52:17.940" style="s2">I&#39;m mindful now also this character</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.360" end="00:52:31.500" style="s2">society and maybe I&#39;m actually stealing</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.310" end="00:52:32.880" style="s2">a bit from deloitte so if you if you if</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.500" end="00:52:34.470" style="s2">you&#39;re a delays and you think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.880" end="00:52:35.850" style="s2">standing firm to lawyers then great if</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.470" end="00:52:38.970" style="s2">your doors you know that demoys likes</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.850" end="00:52:40.680" style="s2">people to steal so I&#39;ll do that but he</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.970" end="00:52:43.590" style="s2">distinguishes between this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.680" end="00:52:45.060" style="s2">Society of discipline yeah and when he</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.590" end="00:52:47.370" style="s2">talks about in society of discipline as</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.060" end="00:52:50.100" style="s2">this initiative vertically integrated</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.370" end="00:52:53.100" style="s2">specialization so that one is a teacher</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.100" end="00:52:55.950" style="s2">in the context of the school and all</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.100" end="00:52:58.680" style="s2">teacher leanness all education is</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.950" end="00:53:01.530" style="s2">domain-specific to the institution of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.680" end="00:53:03.420" style="s2">the school right right okay that&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.530" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">I would like to just kill that it&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.420" end="00:53:06.510" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer and we need to be living</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:08.190" style="s2">through a little bit longer if it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.510" end="00:53:09.510" style="s2">not a lot if you gather paying any</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.190" end="00:53:11.220" style="s2">attention with schools or trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.510" end="00:53:12.150" style="s2">in the context of the coronavirus of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.220" end="00:53:14.670" style="s2">pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.150" end="00:53:16.470" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s done so what&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.670" end="00:53:18.120" style="s2">that comes after the whole system so</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.470" end="00:53:20.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a society of discipline meaning</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.120" end="00:53:22.410" style="s2">that you are in prison or in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.250" end="00:53:23.820" style="s2">hospital or at the factory or at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.410" end="00:53:25.740" style="s2">office right each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.820" end="00:53:29.010" style="s2">and he had his identity structures where</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.740" end="00:53:33.060" style="s2">I&#39;m only I&#39;m you know dad at home and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.010" end="00:53:34.440" style="s2">working at work in this new place the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.060" end="00:53:35.580" style="s2">stack goes from being vertically</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.440" end="00:53:38.100" style="s2">integrated to being horizontally</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.580" end="00:53:40.170" style="s2">integrated so you&#39;re now full note right</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.100" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">so I am always in education and my</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.170" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">experience is always open to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:44.850" style="s2">possibility of Education</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.230" style="s2">I&#39;m always parenting matrons has always</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.850" end="00:53:47.760" style="s2">opened the possibility of parent I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.230" end="00:53:49.710" style="s2">always working when experience olives to</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.760" end="00:53:51.870" style="s2">open the possibility of working and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.710" end="00:53:52.950" style="s2">must maintain in myself each human must</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.870" end="00:53:54.900" style="s2">have wholeness of all those</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.950" end="00:53:56.460" style="s2">possibilities at least as stem cells and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.900" end="00:53:57.900" style="s2">this is potentials that they can</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.460" end="00:54:00.300" style="s2">activate in moments where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.900" end="00:54:03.600" style="s2">moments arise so then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.300" end="00:54:05.430" style="s2">this skillful capacity this this I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.600" end="00:54:06.870" style="s2">you can we keep kind of hitting on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.430" end="00:54:09.000" style="s2">same things but now the residents just</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.870" end="00:54:10.620" style="s2">gets bigger and better of just being</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.000" end="00:54:12.810" style="s2">having a discernment and awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.620" end="00:54:14.430" style="s2">what the moment portends right between</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.810" end="00:54:17.370" style="s2">you and I there is a moment in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.430" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">moment there&#39;s a just attention let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.370" end="00:54:20.880" style="s2">just just say what is the highest</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:23.190" style="s2">possibility this moment affords and all</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.880" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">of the modalities of human possibility I</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.190" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">can&#39;t hug you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.090" style="s2">so unfortunately hugging is not one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">them although it would be good if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.090" end="00:54:31.740" style="s2">could can I break bread with you I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:32.940" style="s2">talk with you and that&#39;s neat because</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.740" end="00:54:35.420" style="s2">you actually a very far away it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.940" end="00:54:38.250" style="s2">really interesting possibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.420" end="00:54:39.870" style="s2">so that&#39;s threat to what degree can we</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.250" end="00:54:42.420" style="s2">constantly kind of dancing through the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.870" end="00:54:44.220" style="s2">encounters that are possible and then in</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.420" end="00:54:44.910" style="s2">the moments that emerge out of that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.220" end="00:54:47.550" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.910" end="00:54:49.470" style="s2">how do them play into the emerging them</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.550" end="00:54:51.930" style="s2">it&#39;s a possibility to create the highest</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.470" end="00:54:54.570" style="s2">possibility that is available to to in</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.930" end="00:54:56.310" style="s2">good faith right in relationship that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.570" end="00:54:58.590" style="s2">towards the unfolding of the highest in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.310" end="00:55:00.450" style="s2">each of us so that as we shift from</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.590" end="00:55:02.940" style="s2">those encounters and move each of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.450" end="00:55:05.400" style="s2">ripples each of these activist moments</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.940" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">just putting increasing possibility an</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.400" end="00:55:08.850" style="s2">increasing discernment and just get and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:10.170" style="s2">you think about the potential that</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.850" end="00:55:12.330" style="s2">builds and something that has that</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.170" end="00:55:14.040" style="s2">orientation instead of sucking the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.330" end="00:55:16.140" style="s2">potential out of the universe and moving</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.040" end="00:55:18.210" style="s2">into actual to try to get this material</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.140" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">that makes us feel safe we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.210" end="00:55:22.410" style="s2">building a recombining</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:23.970" style="s2">potential that is blowing up in</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.410" end="00:55:26.670" style="s2">potential because every encounter</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.970" end="00:55:27.330" style="s2">expands the potential more so even than</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.670" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">the actual</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.330" end="00:55:32.580" style="s2">that&#39;s fantastic I love that imagery</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool I like that idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.580" end="00:55:37.530" style="s2">about instead of trying to collapse to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.560" end="00:55:40.020" style="s2">safety we keep I mean you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.530" end="00:55:41.220" style="s2">a kind of metaphysical empowerment where</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.020" end="00:55:44.610" style="s2">power look I&#39;m going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.220" end="00:55:48.030" style="s2">original meaning of power which is a you</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.610" end="00:55:52.320" style="s2">know a potential that you can actualize</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.030" end="00:55:55.610" style="s2">as needed right and die Nana</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.320" end="00:56:00.060" style="s2">Dynamis right that kind of notion of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.610" end="00:56:02.010" style="s2">so I&#39;m also trying to think about what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.060" end="00:56:03.960" style="s2">like that idea I mean one of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.010" end="00:56:07.500" style="s2">pedagogical principles as a teacher is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.960" end="00:56:09.420" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing my best teaching when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.500" end="00:56:12.780" style="s2">sharing learning with you rather than</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.420" end="00:56:14.850" style="s2">disseminating information to you so if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.780" end="00:56:17.160" style="s2">get to my place if I can get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.850" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">where I&#39;m experiencing insight or flow</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.160" end="00:56:22.740" style="s2">in teaching then I&#39;m actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:25.650" style="s2">right if I can get on the edge of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.740" end="00:56:28.830" style="s2">induction right to draw forth educe</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.650" end="00:56:31.080" style="s2">right if I can get into a place where</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.830" end="00:56:35.340" style="s2">things are being drawn from me that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.080" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t see before as I&#39;m teaching so</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.340" end="00:56:39.120" style="s2">right so the distinction between me</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:40.710" style="s2">teaching you and me learning within the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.120" end="00:56:44.310" style="s2">teaching you it&#39;s completely blurred</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.710" end="00:56:47.100" style="s2">back for me is is good good teaching but</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.310" end="00:56:49.140" style="s2">what that calls to mind then the way you</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.100" end="00:56:51.300" style="s2">talked about that I mean cuz I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.140" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">increasingly sort of zeroing in on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.300" end="00:56:55.530" style="s2">critique the way our culture has</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:56.940" style="s2">collapsed my deepest goes with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.530" end="00:56:59.990" style="s2">managerial imperative you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.940" end="00:57:02.370" style="s2">talking about how we&#39;ve collapsed into a</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.990" end="00:57:04.650" style="s2">monologic understanding of the mind the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.370" end="00:57:06.020" style="s2">mind works mana logically rather than</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.650" end="00:57:08.820" style="s2">dialogical II although there&#39;s now just</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.020" end="00:57:11.250" style="s2">increasingly good evidence that we work</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.820" end="00:57:15.630" style="s2">much better dialogic Lee than we do mana</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.250" end="00:57:16.740" style="s2">logically right that the monophasic that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.630" end="00:57:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of one state of</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.740" end="00:57:20.670" style="s2">consciousness we should always be in and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.960" end="00:57:22.350" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the ultimate I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.670" end="00:57:24.660" style="s2">about sort of the Enlightenment heritage</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.350" end="00:57:26.700" style="s2">it gave us you know clip this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.660" end="00:57:28.980" style="s2">you know your mock you you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.700" end="00:57:30.030" style="s2">this one state of consciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.980" end="00:57:32.490" style="s2">think about how much this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.030" end="00:57:34.890" style="s2">managerial state right and and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.490" end="00:57:37.230" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a monologue right</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.890" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">because I&#39;m managing right and then and</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.230" end="00:57:41.580" style="s2">then they&#39;re you know and I said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:43.730" style="s2">monophasic and there&#39;s monological and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.580" end="00:57:46.650" style="s2">then monolithic it&#39;s only oriented</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.730" end="00:57:48.270" style="s2">propositional right but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.650" end="00:57:50.440" style="s2">a fourth one I want to try and get here</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.270" end="00:57:53.260" style="s2">that you&#39;re putting your finger on there</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.440" end="00:57:55.720" style="s2">resonates with those three the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.260" end="00:57:59.440" style="s2">which people write the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.720" end="00:58:02.170" style="s2">people see themselves what do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.440" end="00:58:06.220" style="s2">say the almost like an ecology they see</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.170" end="00:58:09.580" style="s2">themselves like the thing you did right</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.220" end="00:58:12.220" style="s2">you know what Arendt said about Eichmann</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.580" end="00:58:14.290" style="s2">and the Nazis they took that vertical</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.220" end="00:58:17.020" style="s2">integration into compartmentalization</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.430" end="01:00:30.790" style="s2">there is the game of what did I learn</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.630" end="01:00:32.290" style="s2">during quarantine what ten new skills</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.790" end="01:00:33.850" style="s2">that I not have that I learned because</p>

<p begin="01:00:33.850" end="01:00:36.490" style="s2">stuff it can be simple like you learn</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.110" end="01:00:39.790" style="s2">how to cut somebody&#39;s hair you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.490" end="01:00:42.280" style="s2">how to make sourdough bread you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.790" end="01:00:44.020" style="s2">learn all kinds of new skills well one</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.280" end="01:00:45.160" style="s2">of the very first things is to enter</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.020" end="01:00:47.290" style="s2">into the consciousness that your</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.160" end="01:00:50.950" style="s2">possibility for self learning a new</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.290" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">skill is largely unfettered yeah each</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.950" end="01:00:53.710" style="s2">entrance be tensions like these pools</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.260" style="s2">where it&#39;s instead of steps it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.710" end="01:00:58.150" style="s2">smooth speech and you have to dive into</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.260" end="01:00:59.350" style="s2">learning how to fly rocket ships first</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.150" end="01:01:00.790" style="s2">order learn how to do something simple</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.350" end="01:01:02.620" style="s2">first you can teach yourself you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.790" end="01:01:04.480" style="s2">teach yourself and bite off more than</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.620" end="01:01:06.700" style="s2">you can chew right next step get</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.480" end="01:01:08.050" style="s2">yourself little bit more but everybody</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.700" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">right now I should be taking it as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.050" end="01:01:12.280" style="s2">primary ethical obligation that instead</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:13.720" style="s2">of watching Netflix by the way kung fu</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.280" end="01:01:15.100" style="s2">is fine and I&#39;m gonna recommend that to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.720" end="01:01:17.470" style="s2">my kids it&#39;s a great idea it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.100" end="01:01:19.180" style="s2">Brad about that but instead of instead</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.470" end="01:01:20.770" style="s2">of real sort of binge watching with</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.180" end="01:01:23.800" style="s2">friends I&#39;ll use that as an example of</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.770" end="01:01:25.630" style="s2">what not to do watch it teach yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.800" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">new skills educate all kinds of skills</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.630" end="01:01:30.580" style="s2">make cheese make yogurt repair stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:32.020" style="s2">like but the point is not the skills</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.580" end="01:01:34.150" style="s2">you&#39;re learning the point is the skill</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.020" end="01:01:35.980" style="s2">to learn skills and not go behind is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.150" end="01:01:38.740" style="s2">consciousness of the capacity to become</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.980" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">a stem cell and by the way meta skills</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.740" end="01:01:42.520" style="s2">like okay watch some YouTube videos on</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:44.530" style="s2">how to have really rich dialogue with</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.300" end="01:02:35.619" style="s2">between learning and meta learning</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.069" end="01:02:37.480" style="s2">learning about learning right and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.619" end="01:02:39.430" style="s2">this is that compression variation thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.480" end="01:02:42.190" style="s2">right again what do all the learnings</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.430" end="01:02:44.290" style="s2">have in common right and yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.190" end="01:02:47.319" style="s2">and then what and then look at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.290" end="01:02:48.550" style="s2">variations and then okay use the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.319" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">they have in common to acquire a new</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.550" end="01:02:53.079" style="s2">skill a new variation and then read oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:54.760" style="s2">now I know new things that they all have</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.079" end="01:02:56.380" style="s2">in common and that affords me of</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.760" end="01:02:59.380" style="s2">learning a new skill and you know do</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.380" end="01:03:00.910" style="s2">that cycle where yeah what&#39;s invariant</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.380" end="01:03:02.740" style="s2">so you could learn something you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.910" end="01:03:05.050" style="s2">transfer and learn a new thing you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.740" end="01:03:08.609" style="s2">introduce more you&#39;re basically enacting</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.050" end="01:03:11.589" style="s2">evolution right you know vary your</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.609" end="01:03:14.260" style="s2">processing then call from it and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.589" end="01:03:16.540" style="s2">from that vary it again and and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.260" end="01:03:18.970" style="s2">and like involve you like literally</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.540" end="01:03:20.260" style="s2">evolve your learning don&#39;t just learn I</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.970" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">think that&#39;s also what you were saying</p>
