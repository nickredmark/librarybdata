<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.440" style="s2">because I figured out what I put here on</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">earth to do and doing that is its own</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.440" end="00:02:11.790" style="s2">reward whether or not I&#39;m ever paid for</p>

<p begin="00:03:59.730" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s not like they&#39;d actually do</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:06.390" style="s2">like your perception of it changes if</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know like</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:22.889" style="s2">about me but I don&#39;t like them I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.720" end="00:04:25.919" style="s2">it&#39;s about the fact that destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.889" end="00:04:28.050" style="s2">planet and I&#39;m here too that&#39;s a little</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.180" end="00:04:51.000" style="s2">to hold on to it but at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.460" end="00:04:58.350" style="s2">like fixing things like secondhand</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.000" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">things I like finding items and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.350" end="00:05:02.100" style="s2">not like other people don&#39;t have to like</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:11.010" style="s2">maybe I don&#39;t like not all my clothes</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">are my favorite pieces of clothing or</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.530" end="00:05:25.849" style="s2">the story it&#39;s like Kent</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.780" end="00:05:32.729" style="s2">it&#39;s that like the more the more we</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.970" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">embrace our true individual selves the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.729" end="00:05:35.419" style="s2">less in competition we are with one</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:37.470" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.419" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">ironically we&#39;re all trying to be this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.470" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">uber version of I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">society says like beautiful and smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:48.840" style="s2">and courageous and know a little about</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:51.479" style="s2">and all of those things also have a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.840" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">narrow definition like smart is like IQ</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.479" end="00:05:59.580" style="s2">smart and beautiful is like symmetrical</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:10.650" style="s2">not beauty that&#39;s conformity that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.819" end="00:06:12.599" style="s2">mean the symmetrical face is little less</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.650" end="00:06:18.539" style="s2">nonconformity and just like in genetics</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.599" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">and circumstances gestation but not in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.539" end="00:06:26.159" style="s2">conflict once for ourselves there is no</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.159" end="00:06:29.310" style="s2">with anyone else also who does the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:31.080" style="s2">saying it was both like we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.310" end="00:06:32.580" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get to the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.080" end="00:06:34.199" style="s2">destination like we&#39;re trying to be the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.580" end="00:06:36.090" style="s2">super version of ourselves and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.199" end="00:06:38.070" style="s2">not being ourselves the strange part is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.090" end="00:06:40.190" style="s2">when we are actually ourselves like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.070" end="00:06:42.180" style="s2">women are authentic selves messy</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.190" end="00:06:46.139" style="s2">beautiful and broke in all at the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.180" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">time like all of it you accept the</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.139" end="00:06:51.180" style="s2">broken pieces they become less broken</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:54.810" style="s2">and that where they don&#39;t that&#39;s fine</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.750" end="00:08:08.990" style="s2">that because the system doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.460" end="00:08:10.610" style="s2">and I can see how if that system did</p>

<p begin="00:10:40.430" end="00:10:44.360" style="s2">robots on I was on your periscope last</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.259" end="00:10:46.730" style="s2">night and when you type in something</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.360" end="00:10:48.110" style="s2">someone else jumps on and types in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.730" end="00:10:51.019" style="s2">the exact same thing and I kept tapping</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.110" end="00:10:52.939" style="s2">on repeat they computer copying you and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.019" end="00:10:54.500" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know it was weird I have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.939" end="00:11:01.939" style="s2">go on and she&#39;s search with what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.500" end="00:11:05.449" style="s2">actually was that I have like seven</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.939" end="00:11:07.009" style="s2">subscribers so like a wading birds start</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.449" end="00:11:08.209" style="s2">getting to the point where people jump</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.009" end="00:11:09.470" style="s2">off but that if I like call people out</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.209" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">every time they might called that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.470" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">hopefully calling people in but um</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:17.720" style="s2">anyway yeah this idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:20.569" style="s2">supposed to be perfect versions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.720" end="00:11:22.459" style="s2">ourselves is broken I and I it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.569" end="00:11:23.389" style="s2">broken for me I don&#39;t know how broken it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.459" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">is for everyone else because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.389" end="00:11:28.130" style="s2">piece of the broken - but like we find a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.660" end="00:11:31.339" style="s2">solution for ourselves like this won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.130" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">work for everybody no won&#39;t it will not</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.339" end="00:11:36.800" style="s2">work for everybody you&#39;re gonna offer it</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:38.329" style="s2">cuz it will work for some people like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.800" end="00:11:39.860" style="s2">the Tony Robbins and then where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.329" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">like if you do that it will work it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.860" end="00:11:43.579" style="s2">like that&#39;s not first of all that in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:45.649" style="s2">itself that statement is very</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.579" end="00:11:46.939" style="s2">problematic like if you do it it will</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.649" end="00:11:49.730" style="s2">work well some people are came to look</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.939" end="00:11:51.740" style="s2">doing it like that&#39;s a big piece that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.730" end="00:11:53.870" style="s2">and it will work it&#39;s another because</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.740" end="00:11:55.610" style="s2">there&#39;s tons of people who do I I tried</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.870" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">the Tony Robbins way and it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.610" end="00:11:59.899" style="s2">for me it&#39;s like doing the actual work</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.399" style="s2">there&#39;s pieces about that work and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.899" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">party sis event that I&#39;m like no it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.399" end="00:12:04.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">like I can go and learn how to put</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.040" end="00:12:09.379" style="s2">makeup on probably capable of that but</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">when I went and gotten my makeup done in</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.379" end="00:12:13.459" style="s2">like a department store and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">done it for probably like two decades at</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.459" end="00:12:21.009" style="s2">least um maybe not quite that long no</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:23.420" style="s2">make me a high school student um that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.009" end="00:12:25.009" style="s2">like it was it wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.420" end="00:12:27.470" style="s2">good and said I didn&#39;t feel like me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.009" end="00:12:29.629" style="s2">like this is a nice face but online and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.470" end="00:12:31.220" style="s2">that&#39;s what I feel like about all of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.629" end="00:12:34.189" style="s2">like it&#39;s like even if it even if it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.220" end="00:12:36.290" style="s2">good it&#39;s not me like it needs to be me</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.189" end="00:12:37.970" style="s2">authentic and I&#39;m like losing my train</p>
