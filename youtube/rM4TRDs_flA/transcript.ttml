<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">said anything so citizen assemblies on</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.150" end="00:03:02.090" style="s2">zoom&#39; I&#39;m doing something similar</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:04.860" style="s2">because one there wasn&#39;t that much</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.090" end="00:03:08.310" style="s2">energy behind people wanting to do this</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">I think if they could jump on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.310" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">participate and see what it is they</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">would be down with it they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:16.530" style="s2">people to understand what my vision is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:18.120" style="s2">is always the difficulty so luckily I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.530" end="00:03:20.850" style="s2">doing something very similar with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.120" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">game V people where we&#39;re using zoom to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.850" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">break off into into think groups into</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:29.579" style="s2">smaller groups I think around a question</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:33.989" style="s2">like on the idea cafe channel and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.579" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">creating a brain that works no we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.989" end="00:03:43.829" style="s2">doing that the universe not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.200" end="00:03:45.569" style="s2">an alignment let&#39;s just restart let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.829" end="00:03:47.489" style="s2">dress without restarting this is this</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.569" end="00:03:50.790" style="s2">live just week I can always cancel</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.489" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">although the beginning part so</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.790" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">extinction rebellion has three demands</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">that they have on their website that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">I was pointed out the us one has a</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">fourth one which i think is very vital</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.359" style="s2">but I think even what I am saying helps</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:07.049" style="s2">us get there because if you watch any of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.359" end="00:04:09.569" style="s2">the other videos on creating a global</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.049" end="00:04:12.510" style="s2">tech cooperative basically gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.569" end="00:04:15.900" style="s2">tools to do everything in anything so</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.510" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">the three demands that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.900" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">rebellion says oh I guess no toffee I</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">don&#39;t know oh no okay just draw peanut</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">it&#39;s only for half an hour okay thanks</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:32.650" style="s2">this is why we need tablets double</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">tablet my laptop I can be on and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.650" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">tablet for her</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:40.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like stellar parenting okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:42.640" style="s2">there three demands are to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:44.350" style="s2">truth so they want them to actually look</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.640" end="00:04:48.850" style="s2">at the science acknowledge the science</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.350" end="00:04:53.730" style="s2">and then number to do something about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.850" end="00:04:56.770" style="s2">act now get to net zero by 2025 the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.730" end="00:04:58.690" style="s2">third thing they want them to do is</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.770" end="00:05:00.460" style="s2">create citizen assemblies which they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.690" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">labeled us beyond politics created an</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.460" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">assembly of citizens that are a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">representation of the population based</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">on diversity that can understand the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:18.820" style="s2">science and give what&#39;s the word give</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.440" style="s2">recommendations to the government that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.820" end="00:05:23.890" style="s2">the government actually has to follow so</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.440" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">beyond a recommendation so that even if</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.890" end="00:05:27.250" style="s2">one government goes in and one</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:29.800" style="s2">government goes out you have this body</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.250" end="00:05:31.420" style="s2">that continues forward I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.800" end="00:05:34.990" style="s2">long people serve on the citizen</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.420" end="00:05:37.480" style="s2">assembly the lifetime appointment um is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:39.070" style="s2">it paid how much they don&#39;t really get</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.480" end="00:05:40.630" style="s2">me tell you about or they could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.070" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">I&#39;m like we can create citizen</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.630" end="00:05:44.110" style="s2">assemblies now and if it was like oh no</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to be on them they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.110" end="00:05:47.920" style="s2">jury duty if we want them to exist but</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to be on them so that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.920" end="00:05:51.850" style="s2">why I think that maybe this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:54.640" style="s2">greatest idea is I was under the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.850" end="00:05:56.770" style="s2">impression that people wanted to be on</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.640" end="00:05:59.080" style="s2">them wanted to collaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.770" end="00:06:02.140" style="s2">understanding the science and creating a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.080" end="00:06:05.740" style="s2">better world I may have been wrong on</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.140" end="00:06:07.530" style="s2">that one but I think that&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.740" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">everything that I do it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.530" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">dichotomy of people who feel qualified</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:15.910" style="s2">but they&#39;re doing other things and want</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">to get paid for their expertise totally</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.910" end="00:06:19.690" style="s2">valid and people who don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:21.160" style="s2">qualified and so feel like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.690" end="00:06:23.200" style="s2">have a voice like that they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.160" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">even have a voice and I think both of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.200" end="00:06:26.440" style="s2">those things are a little bit broken</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">because we need people to come bring</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.440" end="00:06:30.550" style="s2">themselves bring their expertise that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">what the idea Cafe is going to be as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.550" end="00:06:34.120" style="s2">platform for people to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.340" style="s2">and have a conversation on video on</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.120" end="00:06:38.590" style="s2">voice around a meaningful question and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.340" end="00:06:39.710" style="s2">be given people to talk to you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.590" end="00:06:41.509" style="s2">need to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.710" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">pre-made community which to me is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.509" end="00:06:46.130" style="s2">where a lot of social media is failing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.940" end="00:06:49.009" style="s2">us it&#39;s not designed to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.130" end="00:06:51.020" style="s2">connecting it&#39;s designed for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.009" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">like you show us how connected you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.020" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">you have to bring those people together</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:59.419" style="s2">so creating the tell the truth piece is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">where a lot of my ideas in the global</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.419" end="00:07:06.410" style="s2">clickable cafe well the cool tech</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:08.330" style="s2">cooperative our about is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.410" end="00:07:10.520" style="s2">every sector in society in this case</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.330" end="00:07:12.680" style="s2">especially climate change and asking</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.520" end="00:07:14.330" style="s2">what is it we want to know what is if</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.680" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">perfect science was done what does</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.330" end="00:07:17.660" style="s2">everything we want to know I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">if you&#39;re just looking at co2</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.660" end="00:07:23.720" style="s2">I think we should look at way beyond co2</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:25.310" style="s2">where does it come from what does it do</p>

<p begin="00:07:33.259" end="00:07:39.410" style="s2">people are doing that visualization work</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.440" end="00:07:41.750" style="s2">but because it&#39;s I want to say</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.030" end="00:07:50.570" style="s2">on them so they put in all of the work</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.380" end="00:07:52.370" style="s2">and all of the money but they don&#39;t then</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.579" end="00:10:19.790" style="s2">structure and it has to be overarching</p>

<p begin="00:10:35.480" end="00:10:39.769" style="s2">we can resonate with them as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">because we&#39;re sapiens step back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.769" end="00:10:44.860" style="s2">asking what should we know and then what</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.089" end="00:11:03.439" style="s2">create massive transit together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.189" end="00:11:05.480" style="s2">not happening until there&#39;s millions</p>
