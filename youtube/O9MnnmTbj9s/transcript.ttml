<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">be this what do I need can actually be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.410" end="00:03:03.990" style="s2">first aisle common ground right because</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.990" end="00:03:08.880" style="s2">you know what I mean so getting on</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">getting on board with that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.880" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">it seems to me a good starting point for</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:16.410" style="s2">building stuff in terms of me personally</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:19.910" style="s2">what do I need again a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.410" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">you said struck with me as well so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.910" end="00:03:25.920" style="s2">being involved in something meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.240" style="s2">and important right I mean you changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">the world making it a better place with</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.240" end="00:03:31.410" style="s2">a bit but but whatever it may be there</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">being involved in something which at</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.410" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">least feels to me to be meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually have to be merely fully</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:41.690" style="s2">important right has to feel to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:46.230" style="s2">meaningful and important but yeah beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.690" end="00:03:49.000" style="s2">beyond the sort of obvious survival</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.230" end="00:03:53.830" style="s2">needs I have an</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.000" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">for solitude and a need for a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.830" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">amount of distance a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:00.520" style="s2">right because I kind of see myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:01.780" style="s2">standing back and taking a view of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.520" end="00:04:03.490" style="s2">things right which means I can&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.780" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">involved in the low-resolution stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.490" end="00:04:08.740" style="s2">so that&#39;s I kind of feel like I need</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">that at although that could just be my</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.740" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">own emerging as well could well</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:25.390" style="s2">just be that sees so I&#39;ll stop I&#39;ll stop</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.530" end="00:05:51.250" style="s2">brilliant and it was the middle of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.360" end="00:05:52.690" style="s2">montage of a bunch of different things</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.250" end="00:05:54.790" style="s2">that they had all practice with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.690" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">teacher in the background saying a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.790" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">of stuff which things that I need which</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:03.349" style="s2">is humor</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.349" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">and so that was fun but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:18.150" style="s2">figuring out like how do you like in</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.620" end="00:06:36.840" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because this</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.279" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">conversation has come up in more than</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.840" end="00:06:44.310" style="s2">one context in the last week and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:48.539" style="s2">know one of the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">came up in another conversation was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.539" end="00:06:53.029" style="s2">the the need or the desire for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.180" end="00:07:02.430" style="s2">mentorship from you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:05.639" style="s2">needing elders I guess is the best</p>

<p begin="00:07:05.639" end="00:07:10.800" style="s2">that as somebody you know I I consider</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.150" end="00:07:14.099" style="s2">myself somewhere between the Millennials</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.800" end="00:07:15.870" style="s2">and the and Gen X and trying and like</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.099" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">knowing that I&#39;m ready to step up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.870" end="00:07:20.460" style="s2">take more responsibility but wanting</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.460" end="00:07:25.259" style="s2">elders is something that&#39;s been that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.740" end="00:07:27.180" style="s2">that&#39;s been really on my mind as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.259" end="00:07:29.939" style="s2">like okay I know things that I need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.180" end="00:07:34.949" style="s2">do but like having those people that you</p>

<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:09.329" style="s2">would like Cara was saying about elders</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.149" end="00:11:10.529" style="s2">cuz I think I mean I I completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.329" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">with what you&#39;re saying it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.529" end="00:11:13.950" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply lacking it&#39;s certainly in</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.630" style="s2">Western culture I mean I think in many</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.950" end="00:11:20.459" style="s2">Asian cultures for example if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.630" end="00:11:21.870" style="s2">more present you know yeah the I played</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.459" end="00:11:23.610" style="s2">a glass bead game a little while ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.870" end="00:11:25.079" style="s2">when we played as archetypes arises a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.610" end="00:11:27.660" style="s2">four player game and each of us took on</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.079" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">and took on the persona of an archetype</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.660" end="00:11:32.550" style="s2">and the archetypes were mother child</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.670" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">father elder and what emerged from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.550" end="00:11:41.100" style="s2">game was the necessity for all four of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:43.050" style="s2">these things right I mean whether within</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.100" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2">the individual all within the society</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.050" end="00:11:47.730" style="s2">right but but these roles the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:49.410" style="s2">interplay of these roles with each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.730" end="00:11:51.329" style="s2">is crucial right I mean if you rely too</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.410" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">much on the elders then there&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.329" end="00:11:54.540" style="s2">anything new there&#39;s never anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:56.520" style="s2">fresh there&#39;s never any you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.540" end="00:11:58.529" style="s2">surprise and novelty in society but at</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.520" end="00:12:00.839" style="s2">the same time if you lack the elders</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.529" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">there is that exactly what you said that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.839" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">that sort of sense of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">stability a person that you can turn to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:09.420" style="s2">for advice or just consolation when</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">things about someone that you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.420" end="00:12:14.070" style="s2">absolutely trust and I that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:16.620" style="s2">thing that that is yeah that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.070" end="00:12:19.130" style="s2">really crucial that&#39;s really crucial for</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.620" end="00:12:19.130" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.560" end="00:12:23.970" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s something that is needed</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.870" end="00:12:25.949" style="s2">yes and and I think universally right I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.970" end="00:12:28.709" style="s2">mean even even if you don&#39;t consciously</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.949" end="00:12:30.480" style="s2">acknowledge it as you just have even if</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.709" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">you think no no I&#39;m cool I can sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.480" end="00:12:34.949" style="s2">everything out myself that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:37.499" style="s2">does actually need that at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.949" end="00:12:43.800" style="s2">their lives I think and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.499" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">a bigger need you know it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.800" end="00:12:51.749" style="s2">elders to say to everything</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:53.459" style="s2">this sounds in my head this sounds a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.749" end="00:12:55.589" style="s2">little presumptuous so but like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.459" end="00:12:58.110" style="s2">elders to turn things over and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.589" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">we have done what we&#39;ve you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.110" end="00:13:05.550" style="s2">can do in our lifetime and it&#39;s time for</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:10.889" style="s2">them to you like what let the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.550" end="00:13:13.829" style="s2">are you know ready to step up to you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.889" end="00:13:15.660" style="s2">know have a voice and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.829" end="00:13:17.939" style="s2">interesting one because I consider</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.660" end="00:13:22.920" style="s2">myself to be again between worlds of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.939" end="00:13:26.129" style="s2">theirs I understand the world in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.920" end="00:13:31.559" style="s2">that my L that my elders didn&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.129" end="00:13:33.240" style="s2">because I have because of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.559" end="00:13:35.160" style="s2">point at which I started using the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.240" end="00:13:37.170" style="s2">internet and and you know the age I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.160" end="00:13:38.699" style="s2">and all of those things and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.170" end="00:13:40.319" style="s2">people who are younger than me who have</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.699" end="00:13:42.839" style="s2">an even completely more different</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.319" end="00:13:46.649" style="s2">perspective because they&#39;re considered</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.839" end="00:13:51.180" style="s2">are even more digitally native than I am</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.649" end="00:13:54.059" style="s2">and how like generations like that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.180" end="00:13:56.490" style="s2">so profoundly different I think then at</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.059" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">any other time in history just because</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.490" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">of the level of Technology you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:05.670" style="s2">into yeah all the more reason to vote</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">for them to find relationship with each</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.670" end="00:14:09.420" style="s2">other right because they do have such</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:13.759" style="s2">different perspectives to bring all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.420" end="00:14:15.839" style="s2">more reason that it&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.759" end="00:14:17.009" style="s2">mentioned part of what was coming up</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.839" end="00:14:19.079" style="s2">when we were all sharing what we need</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.009" end="00:14:20.819" style="s2">and when I was finding like commonality</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.079" end="00:14:22.319" style="s2">and everything everyone said for sure</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.819" end="00:14:24.329" style="s2">that like oh yeah that&#39;s also a need of</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.319" end="00:14:26.819" style="s2">mine I also like cuddly animals I also</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.329" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">need safety and I would add to comfort</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.819" end="00:14:32.940" style="s2">but also the differences that that like</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:35.910" style="s2">although I have elders in my</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.940" end="00:14:39.930" style="s2">I absolutely look up to I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.910" end="00:14:41.430" style="s2">having there be a like group of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.930" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">that just because they&#39;ve been on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.430" end="00:14:45.660" style="s2">earth longer have more experience to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:47.190" style="s2">give when I know people who are 25 who</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.660" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">know more than people who are 90 and</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.190" end="00:14:50.730" style="s2">then I know a ton of people who are you</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.730" end="00:14:58.140" style="s2">important to impart but it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:14:59.700" style="s2">the elders because I want society to</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.140" end="00:15:01.500" style="s2">elders I want individuals who want</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.700" end="00:15:03.630" style="s2">elders to have and I want Mentors</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.500" end="00:15:05.190" style="s2">whatever the ages right depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.630" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">subject depends you know and what it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.190" end="00:15:09.300" style="s2">I want mentors there I just don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:10.860" style="s2">it to necessarily be based on age for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.300" end="00:15:12.780" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that for other</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.860" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">people it&#39;s not necessarily that but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.780" end="00:15:17.310" style="s2">that there can be to say everyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:19.500" style="s2">respect elders I don&#39;t respect everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.310" end="00:15:21.930" style="s2">but everyone has to do this everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.500" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">to do that is to me never gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.930" end="00:15:26.010" style="s2">answer it&#39;s like what do I need and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">can i facilitate what I need but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.010" end="00:15:30.260" style="s2">how can i facilitate what you need right</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">like we can create a system of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.260" end="00:15:35.730" style="s2">invitation to elders to be mentors right</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:38.490" style="s2">a situation where there&#39;s more of an</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.730" end="00:15:42.720" style="s2">invitation which is both more the elders</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.490" end="00:15:46.620" style="s2">to show up are gonna be more elderly I</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.720" end="00:15:48.120" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say that like more able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.620" end="00:15:49.740" style="s2">impart and wanting to impart wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.120" end="00:15:52.260" style="s2">right because they&#39;re they&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.740" end="00:15:53.790" style="s2">to be part of that dynamic and then as</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.260" end="00:15:56.310" style="s2">societies just yeah we need some</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.790" end="00:15:58.950" style="s2">intergenerational connection that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.310" end="00:16:00.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to always know Jubilee I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.950" end="00:16:03.030" style="s2">really appreciate that and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.450" end="00:16:05.820" style="s2">helping me to get clarity of you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.030" end="00:16:10.040" style="s2">what is it that I&#39;m what is it that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.820" end="00:16:13.760" style="s2">seeking and it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.040" end="00:16:17.960" style="s2">wanting wanting to have someone who can</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.760" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">set an example of how to move through</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.960" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">the the stages of life you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:28.110" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s the wisdom that I you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like how did you you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.110" end="00:16:35.250" style="s2">how not not what needs to get done but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:38.760" style="s2">like how did you do this how did you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.250" end="00:16:42.120" style="s2">move through those these complicated</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.760" end="00:16:46.470" style="s2">stages of stepping up and taking</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.120" end="00:16:48.540" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.470" end="00:16:52.170" style="s2">hmm yeah it seems to me that this needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.540" end="00:16:53.730" style="s2">to be it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.170" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">presence of elders in the society but</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.730" end="00:16:57.570" style="s2">it&#39;s also the presence of things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">rituals and rites of passage you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.570" end="00:17:00.600" style="s2">what I mean which which which have</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:02.370" style="s2">meaning and the elders are sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.600" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">in charge of that but but they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.370" end="00:17:05.490" style="s2">figureheads of that right because</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:06.600" style="s2">they&#39;ve been around for a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.490" end="00:17:08.970" style="s2">so they&#39;re you know they&#39;re there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.600" end="00:17:11.820" style="s2">solemnity and a gravitas that the elders</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.970" end="00:17:13.920" style="s2">bring through that kind of ceremony you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.820" end="00:17:15.750" style="s2">know which is and so yeah I think in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.920" end="00:17:18.510" style="s2">conjunction something else if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.750" end="00:17:20.340" style="s2">mind which is I was in a thing with</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.510" end="00:17:23.940" style="s2">Bonita Roy a week or so ago she was</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.340" end="00:17:25.470" style="s2">talking about power and the what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.940" end="00:17:27.240" style="s2">trying to get in on here is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.470" end="00:17:30.530" style="s2">wants and needs things she did this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.240" end="00:17:33.570" style="s2">she she she described the power as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.530" end="00:17:37.290" style="s2">interaction between so it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.570" end="00:17:37.800" style="s2">equation right power equals capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.290" end="00:17:39.720" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.800" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">resources and skills she called it R</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.720" end="00:17:43.410" style="s2">divided by needs and once right and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.420" end="00:17:44.910" style="s2">the greater your resources and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.410" end="00:17:47.460" style="s2">capacities the less your needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.910" end="00:17:49.590" style="s2">are the more powerful you are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.460" end="00:17:53.250" style="s2">things right the more personal power you</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.590" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">have and so what I want to sort of talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.250" end="00:17:57.030" style="s2">about is the difference between needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:59.250" style="s2">yeah what do I need versus what do I</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.030" end="00:18:02.670" style="s2">want where is that boundary between a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.250" end="00:18:03.900" style="s2">wants and the need and because one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.670" end="00:18:05.250" style="s2">the points she made I thought was really</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.900" end="00:18:06.750" style="s2">interesting if you&#39;re basing your like</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.250" end="00:18:09.150" style="s2">the sort of Maslow idea if your base</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.750" end="00:18:10.950" style="s2">needs are taken care of then all you</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.150" end="00:18:13.560" style="s2">have left on the on the bottom line is</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.950" end="00:18:17.120" style="s2">once right and once in the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.560" end="00:18:20.040" style="s2">your needs having been met can fuel an</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.120" end="00:18:22.050" style="s2">increase in skills and capacities right</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.040" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2">because you know I want to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.050" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">therefore I need to acquire these skills</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.700" end="00:18:27.090" style="s2">and resources in order to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:29.730" style="s2">this right and so you can actually fuel</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.090" end="00:18:32.370" style="s2">a greater you know a like an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.730" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">increase in personal power because you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.370" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">are your needs are met your wants are</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:41.790" style="s2">being becoming an increase in capacities</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">and so your your ability to act in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.790" end="00:18:45.900" style="s2">world right win with with conviction and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:49.530" style="s2">with powers is is is forever increasing</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.900" end="00:18:52.110" style="s2">so anyway yeah that and once a need</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.530" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.110" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">yeah I specifically I think they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:58.290" style="s2">intertwined once it needs and it could</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">easily be what do I want instead of what</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.290" end="00:19:01.860" style="s2">do I need but I think because they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:03.570" style="s2">deeply intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.860" end="00:19:06.150" style="s2">you can&#39;t answer one without answering</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.570" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">the other there wants that when you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.150" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">them or don&#39;t get them they become a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">need that it&#39;s like okay I actually do</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:15.000" style="s2">need to live near nature even though I</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:17.070" style="s2">won&#39;t you know necessarily die without</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.000" end="00:19:19.140" style="s2">it I&#39;m at my optimal near it and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.070" end="00:19:21.390" style="s2">there&#39;s all the consumer-driven wands</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.140" end="00:19:23.160" style="s2">that even if I get them they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.390" end="00:19:24.299" style="s2">fulfill anything I think they were in</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.160" end="00:19:25.620" style="s2">need but they weren&#39;t really a need</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.299" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">until they get it and then I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.620" end="00:19:29.640" style="s2">wait that wasn&#39;t ones that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:31.290" style="s2">fulfill anything that sometimes in just</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.640" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">seeking the answers they prove to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.290" end="00:19:35.100" style="s2">wants or needs you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:38.270" style="s2">need to answer at first is what I was I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.100" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">was coming to before before this session</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.270" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">what that brought up for me was John for</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:50.299" style="s2">Vicki talks about the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:56.580" style="s2">having needs and being needs and so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.299" end="00:20:03.990" style="s2">example he said is needing to be mature</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.580" end="00:20:06.360" style="s2">and having a car payment like that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.990" end="00:20:08.690" style="s2">confused those needs like having a car</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.360" end="00:20:11.070" style="s2">payment is meeting the need to be mature</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.690" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2">and instead of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:19.559" style="s2">there&#39;s a need to be mature or the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.950" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">one is a need to meeting the need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.559" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">in be in love by having sex it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.480" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">confusing those two things I think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:33.419" style="s2">there&#39;s a and yeah I don&#39;t know quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:37.080" style="s2">how that ties in but it&#39;s it&#39;s a similar</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.419" end="00:20:39.150" style="s2">thing of like there&#39;s the need to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.080" end="00:20:40.730" style="s2">something and there&#39;s an and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.150" end="00:20:44.220" style="s2">there&#39;s the need to have something and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.730" end="00:20:47.429" style="s2">whether or not and and have those things</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.220" end="00:20:51.059" style="s2">been confused or transpose and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.429" end="00:20:53.669" style="s2">for a lot of our current culture and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.059" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">know me personally I confuse the two at</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.669" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.040" end="00:21:10.020" style="s2">silence just factually yes another</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.310" end="00:21:14.340" style="s2">example of curse news is even even</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.020" end="00:21:16.350" style="s2">simpler right that the need if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.340" end="00:21:19.290" style="s2">dehydrated the need for hydration</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.350" end="00:21:21.000" style="s2">becomes the want for a can of coke sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.290" end="00:21:23.010" style="s2">of thing right and I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.000" end="00:21:25.200" style="s2">pretty simple line to follow the need</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.010" end="00:21:27.000" style="s2">for hydration is very real but actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.200" end="00:21:28.980" style="s2">the coke is not meeting that need if</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.000" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">anything is making it worse you know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.980" end="00:21:35.490" style="s2">also just see what I mean and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:40.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the option if you&#39;re needing or</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.490" end="00:21:42.810" style="s2">trying to deal with with the wand is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.560" end="00:21:46.050" style="s2">transportation well a car fulfills that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.810" end="00:21:47.940" style="s2">but in its meeting of your need any car</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.050" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">would fulfill that right it&#39;s your need</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.940" end="00:21:51.990" style="s2">or you know to look like an adult to</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:54.690" style="s2">have prestige to get to that specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.990" end="00:21:56.550" style="s2">color so in figuring out what piece of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.690" end="00:21:59.310" style="s2">that is an actual need it&#39;s eight you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.550" end="00:22:01.050" style="s2">able to I think be happier with anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.310" end="00:22:02.160" style="s2">that meets that need or not because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.780" end="00:23:08.679" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.640" end="00:23:11.460" style="s2">yeah well I think it but it&#39;s against</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.679" end="00:23:15.690" style="s2">you you know it&#39;s a confusion of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.460" end="00:23:19.720" style="s2">you know a need for maybe status and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.690" end="00:23:22.630" style="s2">cars some at some point coming to</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.720" end="00:23:23.830" style="s2">represent status I was actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.630" end="00:23:28.360" style="s2">actually something I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.830" end="00:23:32.860" style="s2">a while ago because there was someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.360" end="00:23:36.250" style="s2">that I was in a relationship with for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.860" end="00:23:41.169" style="s2">while and like he was always trading up</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.250" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">for a nicer car and like but now my</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.169" end="00:23:46.419" style="s2">question when I see somebody driving a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:49.110" style="s2">nice car is how big is their car payment</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.419" end="00:23:52.630" style="s2">and how much does that impact their</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.110" end="00:23:56.770" style="s2">credit ratio like that&#39;s the question I</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.630" end="00:23:58.870" style="s2">like so now but it&#39;s but it&#39;s a funny</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.770" end="00:24:01.659" style="s2">thing how those things got you know like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.870" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">I think the the conversation of what do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.659" end="00:24:09.429" style="s2">I need is ties back to like what have I</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">confused with me it&#39;s like I need</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.429" end="00:24:14.620" style="s2">someone like like as a woman I might</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:16.870" style="s2">have at some point in my past confused</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.620" end="00:24:21.429" style="s2">the need for a man who had a particular</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.870" end="00:24:25.260" style="s2">status or a particular car as that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.429" end="00:24:29.309" style="s2">representing the status that he had and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.260" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">that and there being that confusion a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.309" end="00:24:34.090" style="s2">yeah which is also so is bringing up as</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:35.890" style="s2">any other questions the difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.090" end="00:24:38.679" style="s2">between want to need like what I think I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.890" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">want in a partner or community first is</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.679" end="00:24:43.990" style="s2">what I actually mean in a part in her</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:45.940" style="s2">community and saying within myself want</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.990" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">to be versus when I actually need to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.940" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">which is myself and to work within my</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:53.169" style="s2">own limitations without putting</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">judgements on it and let yeah every all</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.169" end="00:24:55.840" style="s2">of them did you&#39;re fine</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:24:58.240" style="s2">I mean sometimes things that you need</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.840" end="00:25:00.250" style="s2">you really really don&#39;t want you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.240" end="00:25:02.200" style="s2">what I mean for example if you&#39;re a drug</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.250" end="00:25:03.450" style="s2">addicts and you need rehab right</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.200" end="00:25:04.950" style="s2">don&#39;t wanna you really</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.450" end="00:25:06.899" style="s2">you really don&#39;t want it last thing you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.950" end="00:25:09.690" style="s2">want is to go into rehab just want to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.899" end="00:25:12.450" style="s2">more drugs right so you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.690" end="00:25:13.769" style="s2">yeah they can be in direct conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.450" end="00:25:18.570" style="s2">each other I was just thinking exactly</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.769" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">that as you were talking to connect in</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.570" end="00:25:22.440" style="s2">whatever way we&#39;re addicted to something</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:24.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t ready to say no to in it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.440" end="00:25:26.130" style="s2">family or society doing it right there</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.510" end="00:25:28.019" style="s2">are the ones with the need for you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.130" end="00:25:29.549" style="s2">give it up even if you actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.019" end="00:25:32.850" style="s2">biological need to give it up because</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.549" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">it&#39;s killing you possibly yeah we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.850" end="00:25:37.289" style="s2">ready you&#39;re not ready and yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:39.809" style="s2">hate it it becomes even if you need it</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.289" end="00:25:41.490" style="s2">because it&#39;s not a want it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.809" end="00:25:43.080" style="s2">work in the same regard it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.490" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">waiting til because I know with my</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.080" end="00:25:48.600" style="s2">addiction cycle I always get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:50.460" style="s2">where I&#39;m like this is shitty I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.600" end="00:25:51.870" style="s2">want this and then I want to change and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.460" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">that&#39;s the catalyst to change and every</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.870" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">time I go through that cycle it has less</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:58.470" style="s2">and less strong hold on my life but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:26:02.010" style="s2">mean there are definitely things that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.470" end="00:26:03.570" style="s2">both then I do need and yet I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.010" end="00:26:04.740" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t necessarily do them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.570" end="00:26:07.549" style="s2">then there&#39;s things in my life I both</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.740" end="00:26:09.539" style="s2">need and want and still don&#39;t do them I</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.049" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">own cars kind of thing I was gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.049" end="00:29:25.970" style="s2">about the needs and wants when Kira was</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:28.440" style="s2">talking was that those needs and wants</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.970" end="00:29:30.169" style="s2">that I have a certain level of safety</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.440" end="00:29:32.929" style="s2">and comfort and if it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.169" end="00:29:35.480" style="s2">not met I can&#39;t deal with any of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.929" end="00:29:38.690" style="s2">outside chaos and so I need a certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.480" end="00:29:41.749" style="s2">level of my my needs for safety and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.690" end="00:29:44.239" style="s2">comfort being met before I can fully be</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.749" end="00:29:46.519" style="s2">present and accepting of the lessons</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.239" end="00:29:48.529" style="s2">that come from conflict and period like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.519" end="00:29:49.970" style="s2">people pushing back right if it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.529" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">happening constantly I wouldn&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.970" end="00:29:53.419" style="s2">to handle of it because the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:54.830" style="s2">always gonna eventually give me someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.419" end="00:29:58.609" style="s2">that I&#39;m gonna you know come up against</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.830" end="00:30:00.679" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna give me a lesson I can deal</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.609" end="00:30:02.330" style="s2">with that because of the underlining</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.679" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">safety and comfort that I&#39;ve surrounded</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.330" end="00:30:07.190" style="s2">myself with and we I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:09.350" style="s2">different needs for that level of safety</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.190" end="00:30:12.559" style="s2">and comfort some of us have a much a</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.350" end="00:30:15.820" style="s2">much higher one yet yes we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.559" end="00:30:18.230" style="s2">down especially our once but also I</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.820" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">don&#39;t know how much control we have over</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.230" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">it like I don&#39;t want to need marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:28.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s a piece that does and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:30.499" style="s2">until I deal with that it&#39;s not it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.639" end="00:30:33.259" style="s2">no one else&#39;s power to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.499" end="00:30:35.119" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly in mine but I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.259" end="00:30:36.889" style="s2">have complete power over it it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.119" end="00:30:38.299" style="s2">for society be like well you should have</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.889" end="00:30:42.139" style="s2">control over this this is the one you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.299" end="00:30:45.799" style="s2">can control I don&#39;t know takes away my</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.139" end="00:30:48.830" style="s2">safety in and comfort no that&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.799" end="00:30:51.169" style="s2">know that was just well I think this you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.830" end="00:30:54.700" style="s2">know goes back back to what Eric was</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.169" end="00:30:59.809" style="s2">saying that pointing that direction</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.700" end="00:31:04.039" style="s2">going back to the like reducing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.809" end="00:31:05.960" style="s2">wants and needs but it&#39;s like figuring</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.039" end="00:31:09.499" style="s2">out where that edge is you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.960" end="00:31:13.909" style="s2">like you know that you know there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.499" end="00:31:15.590" style="s2">the meme of like you&#39;re like here here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.909" end="00:31:16.999" style="s2">your comfort zone and here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.590" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">growth happens I think it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.999" end="00:31:20.809" style="s2">that extreme I think you know there</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:22.789" style="s2">there&#39;s another one that&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.809" end="00:31:25.940" style="s2">here&#39;s your comfort zone and then here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.789" end="00:31:28.580" style="s2">the like challenge realm and then here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.940" end="00:31:30.739" style="s2">the growing realm and you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.580" end="00:31:33.529" style="s2">and that changes on a you know that can</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.739" end="00:31:35.659" style="s2">change on a moment-by-moment if you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.529" end="00:31:39.980" style="s2">day to day if not moment by moment basis</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.659" end="00:31:41.960" style="s2">so like in one moment I I might be like</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:44.330" style="s2">feeling really challenged and then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.960" end="00:31:46.010" style="s2">next minute something subtle</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.330" end="00:31:49.159" style="s2">something subtle could change and all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.010" end="00:31:51.740" style="s2">a sudden it&#39;s become overwhelming and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.159" end="00:31:54.620" style="s2">need to know how to get myself back to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.740" end="00:31:57.890" style="s2">grounded as quickly as possible and so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.620" end="00:32:01.100" style="s2">think like being able to like have a a</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.890" end="00:32:03.710" style="s2">practice that helps me to ground is is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.100" end="00:32:05.360" style="s2">huge part of that it&#39;s like okay a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.710" end="00:32:07.340" style="s2">husband and I are having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.360" end="00:32:09.409" style="s2">about something and all of a sudden it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.340" end="00:32:11.929" style="s2">goes into a realm of like oh look we</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.409" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">landed on one of our one either one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.929" end="00:32:17.539" style="s2">our or the other ones landmines and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know existed and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.539" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">figure out how to you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:23.419" style="s2">navigate that and how do you stay ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">like how do I stay grounded when that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.419" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.620" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">I was also thinking about that equation</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.080" end="00:32:53.880" style="s2">in terms of how the culture we live in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.950" style="s2">dis empowers us because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.880" end="00:32:59.110" style="s2">simultaneously amplifies our wants and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.950" end="00:33:01.030" style="s2">needs right by shoving adverts down our</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.110" end="00:33:02.380" style="s2">throat and and you know creating this</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.030" end="00:33:05.170" style="s2">environment where you have to have stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.380" end="00:33:07.059" style="s2">to be happy and so amplifies our wants</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.170" end="00:33:10.059" style="s2">and needs while simultaneously reducing</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.059" end="00:33:12.190" style="s2">our access to resources and reducing our</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.059" end="00:33:14.620" style="s2">skills right we are not encouraged to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.190" end="00:33:16.450" style="s2">have a wide range of survival skills for</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.620" end="00:33:17.710" style="s2">example right I mean you know how many</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.450" end="00:33:19.059" style="s2">kids know how to start a fire now how</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.710" end="00:33:23.970" style="s2">many no kids know how to skin a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.059" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">or whatever you know what I mean so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.970" end="00:33:29.590" style="s2">that&#39;s it seems to me that that&#39;s if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">accept any sort of validity in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.590" end="00:33:39.790" style="s2">equation then our culture is set up to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:41.559" style="s2">strip us of all of our power I just did</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.790" end="00:33:43.929" style="s2">that formula mathematically and if your</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.559" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">resources equal your needs if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.929" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">actually have just as much resources as</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:51.520" style="s2">what you need then those cancel out on</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.140" style="s2">the top and the bottom you might as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.520" end="00:33:58.390" style="s2">in which case you just have skills over</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.140" end="00:34:01.290" style="s2">once equals power how skilled are you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.390" end="00:34:04.660" style="s2">over what you want in life and how</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.290" end="00:34:06.460" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of CAP that&#39;s kind of game a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.660" end="00:34:09.820" style="s2">that&#39;s anyway I&#39;m gonna say with that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.460" end="00:34:11.590" style="s2">later but it&#39;s I mean I think it can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.820" end="00:34:13.840" style="s2">simplified that equation power equals</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.590" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">capacities divided by once and once</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.840" end="00:34:17.639" style="s2">includes needs and you just you just</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:19.929" style="s2">leave it at that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.639" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">you know the hole the hole but all</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.929" end="00:34:22.840" style="s2">desires whatever if you want to put</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">wants and needs together into desire</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.840" end="00:34:26.590" style="s2">something like that but yeah it can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:28.419" style="s2">it can be stripped down but then but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.590" end="00:34:30.850" style="s2">basic point I mean this is what monks do</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.419" end="00:34:32.470" style="s2">isn&#39;t it is they all the aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.850" end="00:34:34.360" style="s2">aesthetics I should say rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.470" end="00:34:36.429" style="s2">monks necessary this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.360" end="00:34:37.060" style="s2">they do is they strip their needs right</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.429" end="00:34:39.310" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.060" end="00:34:40.899" style="s2">basically to zero you know they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.310" end="00:34:42.790" style="s2">need to eat they don&#39;t need to drink</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.899" end="00:34:44.169" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to sleep you know they</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.790" end="00:34:45.580" style="s2">don&#39;t need clothes they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.169" end="00:34:46.929" style="s2">shelter you know what I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.580" end="00:34:48.280" style="s2">this is exactly what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.929" end="00:34:50.950" style="s2">stripping because if the bottom line</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.280" end="00:34:52.840" style="s2">becomes zero your power becomes infinite</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.950" end="00:34:55.000" style="s2">right any number divided by zero is</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.840" end="00:34:56.770" style="s2">infinite so if you&#39;re if your wants and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.000" end="00:34:58.119" style="s2">needs can actually be stripped down to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.770" end="00:35:02.200" style="s2">zero you are</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.119" end="00:35:03.579" style="s2">being of infinite power just heard</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.200" end="00:35:06.730" style="s2">acknowledged my mouth was completely</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.579" end="00:35:10.049" style="s2">wrong that it&#39;s not how you deal added</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.730" end="00:35:13.569" style="s2">to both sides not the top and bottom</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.049" end="00:35:18.309" style="s2">well Erik what comes up for me is having</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.569" end="00:35:20.200" style="s2">like been a quite a bit of time in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.309" end="00:35:22.660" style="s2">Buddhist world and understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.200" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">you know the Buddha went through his</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.660" end="00:35:26.440" style="s2">aesthetic period and then discovered</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:30.700" style="s2">that that wasn&#39;t actually where the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.440" end="00:35:34.539" style="s2">answer it was in that middle way and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.700" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">you know I think there is a you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.539" end="00:35:39.749" style="s2">might push back a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:42.730" style="s2">assertion or not push back but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.749" end="00:35:46.539" style="s2">reframe it slightly of right now our</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.730" end="00:35:50.289" style="s2">culture is set up in such a way as to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.539" end="00:35:55.599" style="s2">help us figure out what our middle way</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.289" end="00:35:58.769" style="s2">is like with that to help us figure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.599" end="00:36:01.749" style="s2">out very optimistic you but I like it</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.769" end="00:36:04.989" style="s2">because then I have the choice of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.749" end="00:36:06.279" style="s2">you know if I if I set it up as the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.989" end="00:36:07.869" style="s2">culture you know that this is this way</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.279" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">the culture is and I don&#39;t have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.869" end="00:36:13.269" style="s2">then that puts me in an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:15.670" style="s2">disempowered position whereas if I can</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.670" end="00:36:21.519" style="s2">back you know like anytime I venture</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">into Facebook it&#39;s like venturing into</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.519" end="00:36:27.819" style="s2">the jungle of like here by this by this</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:31.900" style="s2">what is this and you know when in</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.819" end="00:36:35.259" style="s2">reality it&#39;s like then I get to work on</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.900" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">that muscle of okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.259" end="00:36:38.700" style="s2">is that something that I actually need</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:41.440" style="s2">is that something you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.700" end="00:36:45.279" style="s2">there are some times there are some some</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.440" end="00:36:47.559" style="s2">ads where I&#39;m like huh I got you know I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.279" end="00:36:50.380" style="s2">might actually click on that one most of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.559" end="00:36:51.700" style="s2">the time if I actually needed it you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.380" end="00:36:58.089" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need an ad to tell you that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.700" end="00:37:00.220" style="s2">know yeah like an it like an example I</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.089" end="00:37:03.880" style="s2">was looking for I was looking for a type</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.220" end="00:37:05.529" style="s2">of desk and then I hadn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.880" end="00:37:07.239" style="s2">bought one yet and then a Facebook ad</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.529" end="00:37:09.099" style="s2">came in with a desk that I was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.239" end="00:37:11.170" style="s2">that&#39;s actually kind of what I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.099" end="00:37:11.620" style="s2">for versus the ones I had been looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.170" end="00:37:14.050" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.620" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">not saying like in that case it was one</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.050" end="00:37:17.410" style="s2">of those ones where because most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:19.330" style="s2">time I find something I buy it and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.410" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">Facebook gives me ads for something I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.330" end="00:37:23.560" style="s2">just bought in that case it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:26.230" style="s2">more optimal version of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.560" end="00:37:30.040" style="s2">looking for but you know most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.230" end="00:37:32.200" style="s2">time it&#39;s like okay is that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.040" end="00:37:35.860" style="s2">like for a long time I got I would get</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.200" end="00:37:41.230" style="s2">down on myself if I if I fell for ads on</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.860" end="00:37:44.290" style="s2">Facebook so yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.230" end="00:37:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like figuring out like like working</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.290" end="00:37:49.260" style="s2">that like all those ads work out a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.000" end="00:38:00.540" style="s2">muscle of resistance like can I resist</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.260" end="00:38:00.540" style="s2">being sold things what about you Shiloh</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.570" end="00:38:07.780" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying kind of reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:09.580" style="s2">the conversation I remember having in</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.780" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">college we were talking about needs and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.580" end="00:38:14.590" style="s2">a lot of the students especially the</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">younger one were talking about how they</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.590" end="00:38:19.810" style="s2">needed computers like that was very it</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:22.260" style="s2">was a need you&#39;re like no that&#39;s a want</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.810" end="00:38:24.940" style="s2">and they were like no I need it because</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.260" end="00:38:27.580" style="s2">you can&#39;t really function in society now</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.940" end="00:38:29.980" style="s2">without it how can I get a job so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.580" end="00:38:32.260" style="s2">interesting how you can all be</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.980" end="00:38:35.860" style="s2">intertwined and it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.260" end="00:38:38.080" style="s2">meme but to be successful you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.860" end="00:38:40.590" style="s2">different set of needs then maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.080" end="00:38:43.180" style="s2">to survive</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.590" end="00:38:45.490" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting boundary example</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.180" end="00:38:48.010" style="s2">the computer because you do kind of need</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.490" end="00:38:50.470" style="s2">it right but it is you don&#39;t need it to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.010" end="00:38:53.050" style="s2">actually survive but you do if you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.470" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">to live in this world you do need one</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.050" end="00:38:56.080" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s an it&#39;s a really good one</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:58.330" style="s2">it&#39;s right on that boundary isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.080" end="00:39:00.460" style="s2">between an actual need and just then I</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.330" end="00:39:02.950" style="s2">think society sets up things as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.460" end="00:39:04.840" style="s2">warrants right computers started as an</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.950" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">absolute ones right they were a luxury</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.840" end="00:39:08.170" style="s2">they wrote lawns and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:10.030" style="s2">something that gives you a leg up so</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.170" end="00:39:11.590" style="s2">then you want it which is also a need</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.030" end="00:39:13.000" style="s2">and then it becomes mainstream and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.590" end="00:39:14.980" style="s2">everyone has one and then you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.000" end="00:39:17.560" style="s2">real disadvantage not having it like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.980" end="00:39:19.240" style="s2">right now everyone&#39;s at home</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.560" end="00:39:20.860" style="s2">luckily the teacher is called and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.240" end="00:39:22.990" style="s2">like do your kids have you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.860" end="00:39:24.670" style="s2">electronics I think they have some to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.990" end="00:39:28.599" style="s2">lend out if they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.670" end="00:39:31.029" style="s2">but that level right like they don&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.599" end="00:39:42.220" style="s2">have access to that actually and so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.029" end="00:39:45.130" style="s2">can&#39;t anyway the society sets up once</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.220" end="00:39:46.450" style="s2">and then they become needs on a society</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.130" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">of a level that now if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.450" end="00:39:51.010" style="s2">computer you&#39;re at a disadvantage and</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:51.819" style="s2">although it&#39;s not a need you can survive</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.010" end="00:39:55.059" style="s2">without one</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.819" end="00:39:56.740" style="s2">it gets you access to to a job money and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.059" end="00:39:57.880" style="s2">that gets you access to all the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:39:59.109" style="s2">you do need because if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.880" end="00:40:03.609" style="s2">necessarily have the skills and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.109" end="00:40:05.740" style="s2">resources electricity is a really good</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.609" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">example of what you&#39;ve just outlined do</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.740" end="00:40:09.220" style="s2">believe you might back in the day it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:12.190" style="s2">very much a want it was fun it was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.220" end="00:40:15.450" style="s2">novelty but now it&#39;s very much an ease</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.190" end="00:40:15.450" style="s2">right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.230" end="00:40:20.799" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have an extra see now you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.460" end="00:40:23.470" style="s2">are at a massive disadvantage</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.799" end="00:40:24.519" style="s2">all kinds of stuff you cannot do and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.470" end="00:40:28.210" style="s2">cannot have if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.519" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">electricity and at the same time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.210" end="00:40:33.190" style="s2">a lot of people who opt out and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:36.359" style="s2">have electricity on purpose to not</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.190" end="00:40:40.059" style="s2">participate in this really being a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.359" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">version of humanity when you say a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.059" end="00:40:48.910" style="s2">what you mean maybe they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:54.190" style="s2">their lives in whole and fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.910" end="00:40:55.599" style="s2">because there&#39;s also part of answering</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.190" end="00:40:58.140" style="s2">these questions right and of what do I</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.599" end="00:41:01.420" style="s2">need it&#39;s like I need electricity but</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.140" end="00:41:03.460" style="s2">you know if electricity went away</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.420" end="00:41:06.549" style="s2">tomorrow I wouldn&#39;t kill myself like oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.460" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">good I would really really miss it but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.549" end="00:41:12.339" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t why I&#39;m from it you know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:13.509" style="s2">electricity is refrigeration right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.339" end="00:41:15.309" style="s2">you know your fridge in your freezer</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.509" end="00:41:17.049" style="s2">that&#39;s it so in two days you&#39;ve got no</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.309" end="00:41:19.180" style="s2">food with no electricity for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.049" end="00:41:20.950" style="s2">right it&#39;s that you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.180" end="00:41:26.339" style="s2">not just the lights it&#39;s it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.950" end="00:41:28.990" style="s2">bunch of stuff what came up for me was</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.339" end="00:41:32.920" style="s2">like the Amish and how they are very</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.990" end="00:41:34.839" style="s2">selective about what technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.920" end="00:41:37.269" style="s2">the greater society implements they will</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.839" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">adopt and it&#39;s in it&#39;s fascinating I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.269" end="00:41:41.180" style="s2">reading a book that was</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:42.589" style="s2">um the title of the book was called what</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.180" end="00:41:44.839" style="s2">technology wants and it was talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.589" end="00:41:48.290" style="s2">about the technology as a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.839" end="00:41:52.339" style="s2">living organism and and it but it talked</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.290" end="00:41:54.230" style="s2">about the adoption of technologies by</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.339" end="00:41:55.670" style="s2">the Amish and not been the process that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.230" end="00:41:57.319" style="s2">they go through this person had spent</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:41:59.480" style="s2">quite a bit of time talking to them and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.319" end="00:42:01.540" style="s2">like one of the things I didn&#39;t know is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.480" end="00:42:05.329" style="s2">the Amish have adopted the use of GMOs</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.540" end="00:42:08.390" style="s2">because there there was a specific thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.329" end="00:42:14.660" style="s2">that it was a something very specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.390" end="00:42:17.180" style="s2">that they deemed as it being a enough of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.660" end="00:42:20.839" style="s2">a benefit that eventually they adopted</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.180" end="00:42:24.109" style="s2">it and and I was like I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.839" end="00:42:27.890" style="s2">you know like a and you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.109" end="00:42:29.720" style="s2">and so it was one of those things of</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.890" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">like because they have this specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.720" end="00:42:34.520" style="s2">evaluation process of there might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">somebody who who gets one for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.520" end="00:42:37.910" style="s2">particular reason like in this kit the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:40.609" style="s2">other example that they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.910" end="00:42:43.339" style="s2">about is someone in the Amish community</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.609" end="00:42:46.940" style="s2">had a cell phone because he was part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.339" end="00:42:50.200" style="s2">the volunteer fire department and so he</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.940" end="00:42:54.260" style="s2">he got it in order to be able to be can</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.200" end="00:42:55.940" style="s2">connect contacted for participating in</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.260" end="00:43:00.740" style="s2">the volunteer fire department within the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.940" end="00:43:02.839" style="s2">community and and but the elders were</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.740" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">being which is interesting that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.839" end="00:43:07.780" style="s2">brings it back to the conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.130" end="00:43:11.810" style="s2">elders being very deliberate about</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.780" end="00:43:14.510" style="s2">evaluating how what ultimately was being</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.810" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">used to decide if it was something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.510" end="00:43:21.050" style="s2">the greater community wanted to adopt</p>

<p begin="00:43:34.609" end="00:43:37.880" style="s2">I know a little bit about a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.869" end="00:43:40.099" style="s2">articles about this and they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.880" end="00:43:42.550" style="s2">overriding thing is about the community</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.099" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">right there&#39;s it is it going to increase</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.550" end="00:43:46.700" style="s2">togetherness and and you know bombs</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">within the community or not that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.700" end="00:43:50.869" style="s2">sort of the oh there was something these</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:52.369" style="s2">washing machines like they rejected</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.869" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">washing machines right because it would</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.369" end="00:43:54.799" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:56.059" style="s2">people wouldn&#39;t be out doing their</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.799" end="00:43:57.500" style="s2">washing and hanging there washing up</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.059" end="00:43:58.789" style="s2">together and it would reduce community</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.500" end="00:43:59.990" style="s2">ties and they&#39;re all they weren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.789" end="00:44:01.609" style="s2">to have washing machine something like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.990" end="00:44:02.809" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t mind the labor saving</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.609" end="00:44:05.510" style="s2">but it was the dis it was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.809" end="00:44:06.650" style="s2">possibility for reduced connection that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.510" end="00:44:09.049" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like something like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.650" end="00:44:12.380" style="s2">that&#39;s right the humane thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.049" end="00:44:14.690" style="s2">was about it&#39;s saving labor which</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.380" end="00:44:16.970" style="s2">allowed them to have more community time</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.690" end="00:44:19.700" style="s2">or something like that it that it that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.970" end="00:44:22.549" style="s2">there was something that it there was</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.700" end="00:44:26.299" style="s2">something it saved them a bunch of time</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.549" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">on which allowed them to be more to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.299" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">participate more in community just</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:34.849" style="s2">because that&#39;s like a beautiful example</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:37.059" style="s2">of why people want elders and also why I</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.849" end="00:44:39.710" style="s2">in no way want elders just like it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.059" end="00:44:41.150" style="s2">love the idea of wisdom deciding on</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.710" end="00:44:43.670" style="s2">something especially based on our shared</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.150" end="00:44:45.470" style="s2">values and I want to be able to decide</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.670" end="00:44:47.119" style="s2">can I use the washing machine right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.470" end="00:44:48.529" style="s2">you gave me your guidance and then I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.119" end="00:44:49.880" style="s2">decide for myself but that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.529" end="00:44:51.500" style="s2">individualistic and not about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.880" end="00:44:54.230" style="s2">community right I want the washing</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.500" end="00:44:55.490" style="s2">machine you all can go in communicate</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.230" end="00:44:57.470" style="s2">will you wash your clothes</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.490" end="00:45:01.940" style="s2">I&#39;ll get connections some other way but</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.470" end="00:45:08.119" style="s2">it&#39;s that like feeling power over as</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.940" end="00:45:11.089" style="s2">opposed to community with that&#39;s my like</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.119" end="00:45:16.069" style="s2">that&#39;s because it&#39;s beautiful that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.089" end="00:45:20.539" style="s2">works yeah doesn&#39;t community with</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.069" end="00:45:23.809" style="s2">sometimes involve putting what you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.539" end="00:45:26.210" style="s2">aside as being part of the community</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.809" end="00:45:28.039" style="s2">right I mean I again it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.210" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a balance right you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.039" end="00:45:30.799" style="s2">got are you gonna let people be</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:34.160" style="s2">themselves but at the same time people</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.799" end="00:45:39.549" style="s2">have to give up some of that because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.160" end="00:45:42.049" style="s2">doesn&#39;t you think there&#39;s a line there</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.549" end="00:45:43.490" style="s2">absolutely is and I mean there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.049" end="00:45:46.099" style="s2">things I would give up and wouldn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.490" end="00:45:48.710" style="s2">up and that&#39;s because if if the central</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.099" end="00:45:50.839" style="s2">body decides then there might always be</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.710" end="00:45:52.579" style="s2">a deal-breaker for me right but if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.839" end="00:45:54.589" style="s2">not necessary part of the central body</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.579" end="00:45:57.109" style="s2">but I get to choose so we have decided</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.589" end="00:45:59.089" style="s2">washing machines aren&#39;t under our</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.109" end="00:46:01.279" style="s2">guidance but that might be the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.089" end="00:46:03.140" style="s2">I do because it makes me more of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.279" end="00:46:04.910" style="s2">community contributing member right if I</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.140" end="00:46:06.260" style="s2">have time to do this then I can you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.910" end="00:46:08.060" style="s2">like it might make</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.260" end="00:46:09.410" style="s2">me a better person and able to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.060" end="00:46:11.870" style="s2">so I can choose different than the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.410" end="00:46:14.030" style="s2">guidance is different to me then right</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.870" end="00:46:16.070" style="s2">but we&#39;ve decided this community our</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.030" end="00:46:18.110" style="s2">intentional community we have some</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.070" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">guidance around you know like kids and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.110" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">tablets in the common house and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:23.420" style="s2">there&#39;s also like right I don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:27.470" style="s2">here I can&#39;t send my kid home to do this</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.420" end="00:46:30.440" style="s2">like there&#39;s a certain level of if it</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.470" end="00:46:32.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work for you we can work around</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.440" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">it that doesn&#39;t happen generally in</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.420" end="00:46:36.410" style="s2">those type of communities because it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.070" end="00:46:38.030" style="s2">about you&#39;ve you&#39;ve someone given up</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.410" end="00:46:40.460" style="s2">your individuality for the group rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.030" end="00:46:42.290" style="s2">than at being a feedback this is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.460" end="00:46:43.340" style="s2">guidance and then yes we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.290" end="00:46:45.380" style="s2">if you&#39;re not doing that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.340" end="00:46:47.390" style="s2">probably a reason why and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.380" end="00:46:48.380" style="s2">point that breaks right if everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:50.180" style="s2">doing that all of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.380" end="00:46:52.310" style="s2">everyone&#39;s not following 99% of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.180" end="00:46:54.980" style="s2">stuff 99% of the time why do you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.310" end="00:46:57.500" style="s2">rules but if everyone doesn&#39;t follow 2%</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.980" end="00:47:01.340" style="s2">or 5% but it&#39;s a different 5% right</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.500" end="00:47:03.260" style="s2">between us there can still be cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.340" end="00:47:06.380" style="s2">just depends on what those rules are and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.260" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">how stringent they need to be well and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.380" end="00:47:11.360" style="s2">the the part that I the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:12.980" style="s2">popped up in in my head with that is you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.360" end="00:47:15.890" style="s2">know talking about the Amish in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.980" end="00:47:19.010" style="s2">that like because they have that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.890" end="00:47:21.590" style="s2">thing probably gonna say it wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.010" end="00:47:24.380" style="s2">Rumspringa where they they leave the</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.590" end="00:47:26.060" style="s2">community for a year and go out into the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.380" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">world and see all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.060" end="00:47:30.560" style="s2">they you know that they aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.640" end="00:47:33.560" style="s2">basically making the choice to give up</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.560" end="00:47:37.100" style="s2">by staying at part of the community like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.560" end="00:47:39.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a the choice is still there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.100" end="00:47:41.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know and from my</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.980" end="00:47:43.610" style="s2">understanding some people to you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.600" end="00:47:49.010" style="s2">some people don&#39;t go back yeah many</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.610" end="00:47:52.790" style="s2">numbers are from my understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.010" end="00:47:54.320" style="s2">majority go back right yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.790" end="00:47:56.180" style="s2">really cool I mean I really so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.320" end="00:47:57.860" style="s2">year is it I knew about it I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.180" end="00:48:00.140" style="s2">it was as long as a year so they spend a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.860" end="00:48:02.360" style="s2">whole year just right okay that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.140" end="00:48:04.760" style="s2">cool as I say that that reintroduces</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.360" end="00:48:06.920" style="s2">choice and agency back into it right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.760" end="00:48:09.470" style="s2">i prepared to give up these trappings of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.920" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">the outside world for the intimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.470" end="00:48:13.070" style="s2">community you know what I mean which</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:14.660" style="s2">which is actually more important to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.070" end="00:48:16.010" style="s2">and making that decision in full</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.660" end="00:48:18.950" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s very cool I like</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.010" end="00:48:24.309" style="s2">that I don&#39;t like run track</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.950" end="00:48:24.309" style="s2">as well the concept of it yes mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:29.529" style="s2">and the year is good as well right here</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.380" end="00:48:32.299" style="s2">gives you a proper taste I mean a year</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.529" end="00:48:34.670" style="s2">any sort of indoctrination or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.299" end="00:48:37.099" style="s2">that you&#39;ve had a chance to get free of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.670" end="00:48:38.660" style="s2">that and make eyes wide open sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.099" end="00:48:44.809" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s very cool I like that lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.660" end="00:48:47.390" style="s2">well and that the like you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.809" end="00:48:50.510" style="s2">concept of you know it&#39;s like the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.390" end="00:48:51.950" style="s2">air what&#39;s it called the year where</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.510" end="00:48:55.010" style="s2">you&#39;d like skip and you don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.950" end="00:48:56.450" style="s2">straight to college you like take a gap</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.010" end="00:49:01.039" style="s2">year that&#39;s it that&#39;s the word I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.450" end="00:49:03.019" style="s2">thinking of like that idea of like doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.039" end="00:49:06.559" style="s2">some exploring before you make a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.019" end="00:49:10.250" style="s2">decision or a commitment to what it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.559" end="00:49:12.500" style="s2">that you know you want and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.250" end="00:49:15.170" style="s2">unfortunate thing that happens in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.500" end="00:49:17.240" style="s2">greater culture like with with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.170" end="00:49:20.089" style="s2">concept of room spring and like you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.240" end="00:49:22.490" style="s2">go out and then you come back and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.089" end="00:49:25.339" style="s2">pretty you basically give up all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.490" end="00:49:28.460" style="s2">those things and that you were had</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.339" end="00:49:30.200" style="s2">exposure to and you know come back into</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.460" end="00:49:32.150" style="s2">your community and you&#39;re fully accepted</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.200" end="00:49:34.990" style="s2">back into that community but like with</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.150" end="00:49:37.849" style="s2">that gap year unless you have like</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.990" end="00:49:40.609" style="s2">family who can afford it for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.849" end="00:49:44.240" style="s2">people they go out they get expenses</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.609" end="00:49:47.509" style="s2">they get a car and then they can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.240" end="00:49:50.990" style="s2">back to the they don&#39;t end up going back</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.509" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">to college because they&#39;ve got bills to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.990" end="00:49:57.799" style="s2">pay because the structure isn&#39;t as</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:50:00.950" style="s2">solidified I think as it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.799" end="00:50:02.750" style="s2">concept of Rumspringa it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.950" end="00:50:06.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re wealthy yeah it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.750" end="00:50:07.940" style="s2">more defined but if you&#39;re not yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.200" end="00:50:09.980" style="s2">you you go out into the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.940" end="00:50:14.119" style="s2">start building a crutch moment or a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.980" end="00:50:18.109" style="s2">wrench or whatever and then I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.119" end="00:50:19.460" style="s2">to go back to the authoritarian parent</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.109" end="00:50:21.109" style="s2">you know living with my parents in order</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.460" end="00:50:25.490" style="s2">to go to college or being under their</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.109" end="00:50:29.019" style="s2">thumb to go to college yeah do you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.490" end="00:50:31.910" style="s2">how they support themselves on Mon frère</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.019" end="00:50:33.020" style="s2">they get jobs right and like pay their</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.910" end="00:50:36.560" style="s2">own rent and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.020" end="00:50:39.110" style="s2">I&#39;m not entirely sure I I don&#39;t know all</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.560" end="00:50:40.760" style="s2">of the details I think quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.110" end="00:50:42.950" style="s2">money the Amish I daresay they can they</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.760" end="00:50:45.320" style="s2">can help with financing they&#39;ve got lots</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.950" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">and lots of money I believe do they give</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.320" end="00:50:52.520" style="s2">them an allowance especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.110" style="s2">men that takes place like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.520" end="00:50:59.210" style="s2">alcoholism and addiction that develops</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.110" end="00:51:00.950" style="s2">during that year obviously might be part</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.210" end="00:51:02.510" style="s2">of it if they get an allowance right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.950" end="00:51:05.570" style="s2">so they don&#39;t so it&#39;s like they go from</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.510" end="00:51:07.880" style="s2">being Amish and working 24/7 basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.570" end="00:51:09.860" style="s2">with community to being connected with</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.880" end="00:51:11.900" style="s2">other people who either on Rumspringa or</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.860" end="00:51:16.630" style="s2">chose not to go back to community and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.900" end="00:51:20.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a very like very night and day</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.630" end="00:51:22.310" style="s2">lifestyle right working constantly -</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.360" end="00:51:25.220" style="s2">okay well now I have nothing but time on</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.310" end="00:51:26.360" style="s2">our hands and board and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.220" end="00:51:29.900" style="s2">thing called alcohol that we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.360" end="00:51:35.180" style="s2">tried before yeah and I googled it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.900" end="00:51:37.220" style="s2">actually two years the Amish I thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.180" end="00:51:39.530" style="s2">alcohol was allowed do they not drink no</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.220" end="00:51:41.030" style="s2">as far as I know they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.530" end="00:51:44.330" style="s2">intoxicants of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.030" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">yeah they smoke they smoke darling I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.330" end="00:51:46.810" style="s2">pretty sure I&#39;ve seen them walking</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:51.980" style="s2">around with pipes they smoke don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.810" end="00:51:55.280" style="s2">yeah and and perhaps your question Eric</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.980" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">it looks like 80 percent go back right</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.280" end="00:51:59.090" style="s2">okay thank you for that I was curious</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:02.750" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s actually I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.090" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">cuz cults right like what we consider a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.750" end="00:52:05.840" style="s2">cult for so I don&#39;t know how you</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:07.730" style="s2">distinguish in a religion to call but</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.840" end="00:52:08.990" style="s2">like they where they do use the cult</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.730" end="00:52:10.100" style="s2">tactics right but they don&#39;t let you</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.990" end="00:52:11.540" style="s2">leave they don&#39;t let you talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.100" end="00:52:15.260" style="s2">because then the outside world might</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.540" end="00:52:18.140" style="s2">entice you back how many people from any</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.260" end="00:52:19.820" style="s2">calls would leave spend six months to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.140" end="00:52:21.020" style="s2">year away with their family because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.820" end="00:52:23.660" style="s2">the opposite right your family&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.020" end="00:52:25.610" style="s2">outside and choose to go back whereas</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.660" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">this is they do have your family in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.610" end="00:52:28.820" style="s2">community you can still be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:31.850" style="s2">that if you choose not to go back up for</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.820" end="00:52:34.070" style="s2">Rumspringa but at this not the same way</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.850" end="00:52:36.320" style="s2">right not your kids are gonna be raised</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.070" end="00:52:38.510" style="s2">with their kids and so it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.320" end="00:52:41.390" style="s2">enticing your culture in your community</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.510" end="00:52:42.980" style="s2">being on one side and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.390" end="00:52:45.380" style="s2">other other part of the other side but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.980" end="00:52:46.309" style="s2">love the idea that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.380" end="00:52:47.989" style="s2">question you raised</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.309" end="00:52:49.579" style="s2">much context are they allowed with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.989" end="00:52:50.900" style="s2">community if they choose not to go back</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.579" end="00:52:52.069" style="s2">I mean they can resume early go back and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.900" end="00:52:53.900" style="s2">visit their parents and have lunch with</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.069" end="00:52:55.489" style="s2">them or whatever - there are their kids</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.900" end="00:52:57.109" style="s2">welcome their kids go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.489" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">community when they grow up if they want</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.109" end="00:53:04.489" style="s2">to what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s the deal with</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:06.499" style="s2">all that you know you&#39;re a few people</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.489" end="00:53:08.180" style="s2">grow up not Amish and convert to that so</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.499" end="00:53:10.130" style="s2">but maybe because your cousins might be</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.180" end="00:53:11.269" style="s2">there I dunno if you choose not to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.130" end="00:53:12.650" style="s2">back you can still have contact with</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.269" end="00:53:14.989" style="s2">your family but if you choose to go back</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.650" end="00:53:17.449" style="s2">and then fall there&#39;s a thing where you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.989" end="00:53:21.650" style="s2">just cease - I didn&#39;t exist they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.449" end="00:53:23.209" style="s2">ignore you which is like a death right</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.650" end="00:53:25.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like well they which was this</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.209" end="00:53:27.499" style="s2">documentary I was watching that was they</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.430" end="00:53:29.749" style="s2">this guy got that done to him because of</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.499" end="00:53:31.939" style="s2">his he was reading the Bible in English</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.749" end="00:53:33.289" style="s2">and they were it&#39;s like old German that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.939" end="00:53:35.630" style="s2">they read it in and there was this whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.289" end="00:53:37.130" style="s2">saga for a bunch of them but then like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.630" end="00:53:39.529" style="s2">when his wife went to church but she</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.130" end="00:53:41.660" style="s2">wasn&#39;t kicked out they were like sent a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.529" end="00:53:43.969" style="s2">pie home that was like like like Oh what</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.660" end="00:53:47.539" style="s2">if someone else eats it like that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.969" end="00:53:49.219" style="s2">like just this like really their kid got</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.539" end="00:53:52.130" style="s2">cancer and they went and like clean her</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.219" end="00:53:54.410" style="s2">house and did all this stuff but like</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.130" end="00:53:55.910" style="s2">they still kept that this guy still</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.410" end="00:53:59.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t exist at the same time they were</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.910" end="00:54:01.339" style="s2">still very supportive of them in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.390" end="00:54:02.929" style="s2">time of need it was very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.339" end="00:54:06.069" style="s2">documentary that I have no idea what it</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.929" end="00:54:08.869" style="s2">was even called support I find it again</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.069" end="00:54:12.619" style="s2">I&#39;m fascinated that our conversation has</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.869" end="00:54:14.299" style="s2">has a conversation of needs has gone to</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.619" end="00:54:17.509" style="s2">a place of talking about the Amish</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.299" end="00:54:19.729" style="s2">Rumspringa like well you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.509" end="00:54:22.789" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting like evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.729" end="00:54:28.009" style="s2">how that is how that has come about is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.789" end="00:54:30.769" style="s2">like you know I think that that brings</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.009" end="00:54:32.449" style="s2">out something like that the right Eric</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.769" end="00:54:35.689" style="s2">you mentioned the rites of passage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.449" end="00:54:39.679" style="s2">like those how do you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.689" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">that is actually a thing of like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.679" end="00:54:49.670" style="s2">being able to have those like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">more sacred or intentional rites of</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.670" end="00:54:55.209" style="s2">passage than we have as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:55.209" style="s2">currently</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.180" end="00:55:02.250" style="s2">yeah I mean this is that notion of kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.329" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">of committing to a path you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.250" end="00:55:06.900" style="s2">mean that&#39;s part of maturity isn&#39;t it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:08.549" style="s2">is okay I understand who I am and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.900" end="00:55:11.480" style="s2">I&#39;m here to do and I&#39;m now going to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.549" end="00:55:14.940" style="s2">commit myself to earnestly pursuing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.480" end="00:55:16.589" style="s2">that vision for myself as best I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.940" end="00:55:18.900" style="s2">something like that right and so a rite</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.589" end="00:55:22.130" style="s2">of passage we wear and I mean rice</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.900" end="00:55:24.059" style="s2">passage tend to occur at particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.130" end="00:55:26.190" style="s2">chronological moments right have</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.059" end="00:55:27.690" style="s2">particular ages or whatever right there</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.190" end="00:55:29.730" style="s2">at the occurrence of particular ends but</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.690" end="00:55:32.819" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be like that and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.730" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">you know because you&#39;ve gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.819" end="00:55:36.630" style="s2">ceremony and committed to a path you</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:38.069" style="s2">know commit decided to commit yourself</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.630" end="00:55:39.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean necessarily that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.069" end="00:55:41.039" style="s2">attached to it the life right and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.480" end="00:55:42.299" style="s2">ever leave that path you know like ten</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.039" end="00:55:44.700" style="s2">years down the road you know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.299" end="00:55:47.220" style="s2">actually I think I&#39;d be better suited to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.700" end="00:55:49.650" style="s2">this and maybe you take another ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.220" end="00:55:52.770" style="s2">or not whatever but but it&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.650" end="00:55:55.109" style="s2">it should be a serious commitment but it</p>

<p begin="00:57:55.869" end="00:58:00.130" style="s2">passage she&#39;s seven right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.119" end="00:58:02.230" style="s2">this is perfectly fine she&#39;s exploring</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.130" end="00:58:03.250" style="s2">and playing and figuring out the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.230" end="00:58:06.390" style="s2">and all that and then that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.250" end="00:58:06.390" style="s2">what she should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:10.810" style="s2">older she&#39;s tried all of this stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.040" end="00:58:12.849" style="s2">he&#39;s narrowed down the things that she</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.810" end="00:58:16.150" style="s2">likes and doesn&#39;t like maybe now is</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.849" end="00:58:18.190" style="s2">ready to write this is this is the path</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.150" end="00:58:22.150" style="s2">I want to set myself on at least for now</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.190" end="00:58:23.980" style="s2">right because also the rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.150" end="00:58:26.530" style="s2">are only the mainstream rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.980" end="00:58:28.450" style="s2">right graduating going to university</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.530" end="00:58:29.830" style="s2">your first house your driver&#39;s license</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.450" end="00:58:32.349" style="s2">these kind of things and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.830" end="00:58:33.910" style="s2">when they were showing um you know those</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.349" end="00:58:34.839" style="s2">news stories that come on to cope at 19</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.910" end="00:58:36.369" style="s2">like here&#39;s someone thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.839" end="00:58:38.740" style="s2">innovatively and doing it was a drive</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.369" end="00:58:40.869" style="s2">through graduation ceremony I was like</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.740" end="00:58:42.460" style="s2">thank God like you imagine not having a</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.869" end="00:58:44.680" style="s2">rite of passage at all like we have so</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.460" end="00:58:46.780" style="s2">few in society and this one is just like</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.680" end="00:58:49.510" style="s2">like at least at least a drive through</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.780" end="00:58:50.920" style="s2">is both its unique you&#39;re the only year</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.510" end="00:58:52.599" style="s2">to do that you&#39;re the first year and</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.920" end="00:58:53.619" style="s2">also but like all of them should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.599" end="00:58:55.300" style="s2">doing that like I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.619" end="00:58:57.640" style="s2">any high school or any university that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.300" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">not doing anything because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.640" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">really specially her high school because</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:02.589" style="s2">you could go to different colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.910" end="00:59:05.470" style="s2">grads whereas theoretically you only</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.589" end="00:59:06.970" style="s2">graduate from high school once and for</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.470" end="00:59:08.470" style="s2">them not to get that rite of passage and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.970" end="00:59:09.790" style="s2">people giving birth right now and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.470" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">marriages and they just don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.790" end="00:59:14.619" style="s2">anything like the very few rites of</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:16.510" style="s2">passage that we do have I have a niece</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.619" end="00:59:18.369" style="s2">who&#39;s a senior in high school right now</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.510" end="00:59:21.990" style="s2">and you know my sister&#39;s been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.369" end="00:59:21.990" style="s2">figure out how to handle that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.930" end="00:59:30.910" style="s2">I just want to it&#39;s coming up to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.910" end="00:59:32.440" style="s2">hour this is our fourth question to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.910" end="00:59:35.619" style="s2">explore out of five so next week we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.440" end="00:59:39.040" style="s2">exploring the question what am i ready</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.619" end="00:59:40.540" style="s2">and capable of giving up giving up so</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.040" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">out of those five right it&#39;s the burning</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.540" end="00:59:47.260" style="s2">question it&#39;s like what am I willing to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:48.460" style="s2">release to let go of and I would love if</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.260" end="00:59:50.109" style="s2">the three of you were back because I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.460" end="00:59:51.670" style="s2">I was saying before we started that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.109" end="00:59:53.290" style="s2">Eric and shila&#39;s comes the last two I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.670" end="00:59:54.580" style="s2">think here you came to the first one so</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.290" end="00:59:56.410" style="s2">the fact that it&#39;s the same people</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.580" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">rather regularly I think would be really</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.410" end="00:59:59.650" style="s2">powerful to end it with with the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:01.270" style="s2">people but that&#39;s just an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.650" end="01:00:08.590" style="s2">just put it on the universe that would</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.270" end="01:00:09.940" style="s2">love for you for you to come back I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.590" end="01:00:12.250" style="s2">saying no it&#39;s not an invitation is an</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.940" end="01:00:15.190" style="s2">obligation turn up or else or else</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.250" end="01:00:20.250" style="s2">you&#39;re never invited back ever what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.190" end="01:00:23.380" style="s2">the what&#39;s the last question what do you</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.250" end="01:00:25.330" style="s2">what are you ready to give up but I feel</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.380" end="01:00:26.470" style="s2">like ready and capable is the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.330" end="01:00:27.849" style="s2">because it&#39;s like if you&#39;re not capable</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.470" end="01:00:29.140" style="s2">of it it doesn&#39;t matter and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.849" end="01:00:31.240" style="s2">capable but not ready it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.140" end="01:00:36.820" style="s2">so what are you ready and capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.240" end="01:00:38.470" style="s2">giving it greater I was just concerned</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.820" end="01:00:44.020" style="s2">another way of asking it might be what</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.470" end="01:00:45.190" style="s2">am i cleaning too well only because that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.020" end="01:00:46.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really that&#39;s not with the other</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.190" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">four it&#39;s like I&#39;m what am i brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.660" end="01:00:50.070" style="s2">to release right because yes it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:54.490" style="s2">other part of that right for sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.070" end="01:00:56.140" style="s2">different way of framing to me anyway I</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.490" end="01:00:59.410" style="s2">certainly find that an easy way to frame</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.140" end="01:01:02.430" style="s2">it in terms of answering it the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.410" end="01:01:04.960" style="s2">interesting thing is is I&#39;m part of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.430" end="01:01:07.660" style="s2">mastermind like a meta mastermind group</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.960" end="01:01:12.010" style="s2">and so the idea is like you form a group</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.660" end="01:01:16.150" style="s2">of like three people friend and you do a</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.010" end="01:01:19.390" style="s2">two-week sprint and the idea is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.150" end="01:01:21.339" style="s2">one habit I want to add one what&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.390" end="01:01:24.550" style="s2">thing I want to give up and what&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.339" end="01:01:26.770" style="s2">and a gift and then you might pick one</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.550" end="01:01:28.540" style="s2">or do you know if you&#39;re in a group</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.770" end="01:01:30.940" style="s2">where you really feel like you can you</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.540" end="01:01:32.920" style="s2">might do all three but it&#39;s kind of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.940" end="01:01:35.230" style="s2">similar idea of you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.920" end="01:01:36.430" style="s2">something I want to add like adding a</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.230" end="01:01:38.050" style="s2">meditation practice</p>
