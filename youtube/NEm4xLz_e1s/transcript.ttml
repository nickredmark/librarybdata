<p begin="00:00:01.839" end="00:00:05.680" style="s2">all right welcome to the solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.439" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">raising on voting with your wallet</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.680" end="00:00:08.880" style="s2">which is kind of like the consumer side</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">of the marketing one that we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:12.320" style="s2">previously</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:13.759" style="s2">um or maybe not we&#39;ll let mark decide</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.320" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">more the parameters a solution raises an</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.759" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">hour-long conversation broken up into</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">three parts we</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">talk about what it currently looks like</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:21.680" style="s2">the good the bad and the ugly</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:22.880" style="s2">what we would love it to look like is</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.680" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">the second part</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.880" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t need to match and then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:29.519" style="s2">third part just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">half of it is um how</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.519" end="00:00:33.440" style="s2">is the adjacent possible what we could</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">actually do now if we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.440" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">a large enough threshold of people that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">a handful and yet isn&#39;t requiring</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:44.480" style="s2">the world to to come on board before any</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">kind of real change can happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.480" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">so the parameter normally set for</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.840" style="s2">solution is ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">and a hundred thousand dollars but i am</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.840" end="00:00:52.719" style="s2">open to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">tweaking that especially in the game b</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.719" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">space where we don&#39;t have ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">just end sentences like yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.400" end="00:01:14.479" style="s2">i never really know these formats</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">like they kind of unsettle me sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.479" end="00:01:16.720" style="s2">because i don&#39;t i want to hear what</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:20.479" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.720" end="00:01:22.159" style="s2">wants to say and there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.479" end="00:01:23.360" style="s2">in my mind but i&#39;m trying to apply it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.159" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">back so i</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">i actually hear the most what i can</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">so the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:37.840" style="s2">the idea is to figure out a way to drive</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">business to towards those companies that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.840" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">exhibit some kind of game behavior</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">to nurture</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">that behavior in the general public and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">extinguish</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">generally gradually the kind of gamey</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">rivalrous predatory it&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:03.119" style="s2">predatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">behavior that gaming companies tend to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.119" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">they keep secrets they</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">they look for any advantage and there</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">really is no</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">there really is no um</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">immediate reckoning for behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.680" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">damages a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">so to combat that the idea was having</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:33.599" style="s2">radical transparency</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">and something that does as little harm</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.599" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">little harm is possible i think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2">that is for me a a big thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">it seemed to gain a lot of traction when</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">i put that post in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2">the idea that if we could find a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">to have people um and i think it was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">in yesterday&#39;s group somebody bought up</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">brought up</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">well if if i want to vote with my wallet</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">i want to support a company that&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">good you know like i could just buy that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">phone that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">replace the uh the iphone</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">and i said well what do you know about</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">that company</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s well it looks good the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">product looks good</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">but he said i said you know where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">where they get their products who</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">they&#39;re funded by</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">what kind of harm they&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">where they&#39;re getting their goods</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">manufactured and he couldn&#39;t tell me</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:37.840" style="s2">so this would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">something an app would be something</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.840" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">a possibility something that would</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.319" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">immediately give you that information</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">over the long term this is what this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">this company has done</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">this is where it sources all its</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">materials this is where it&#39;s built</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">this is its impact footing</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">and even more possibly this is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">everybody makes</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">and this is where the money goes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">where it gets money this is where it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">everything everything nothing is hidden</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">so that would be the kind of ultimate so</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">you could see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">and have a clear picture on</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">company but this could also be products</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">so i</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to say too much to narrow</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">it down because</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">this is the stage where i want the net</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.680" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">wide so</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">that um we have a better idea of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">works and what doesn&#39;t work and why it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">hasn&#39;t worked in the past</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:48.160" style="s2">luckily zoom tells me um i what do</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">people currently do for this right how</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.160" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">do you decide how to make your purchases</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">how do you how much do you care what are</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">the values you put in how much</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">energy do you put in like what does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">currently look like for you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">to vote with your wallet right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">um i can start i have put a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">and energy into caring about</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:09.280" style="s2">you know is my stuff organic is it fair</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">trade is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.280" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">and at the same time my trust in those</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">systems is also eroded like even if i</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">buy fair trade how do i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:18.160" style="s2">actually fair trade is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:21.520" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.160" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">than um what else is out there and how</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.520" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">can i</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">be able to trust that and what i know i</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">cannot trust is the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">that they tell me they&#39;re green or they</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">tell me that they&#39;re socially just</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">i do want a metric and so it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">full-time</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">job just to figure out what i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">buy what</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s within my my ethics and values</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">let alone um you know expecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">everybody to do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">but being able to share in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">information is is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">i&#39;m very excited for for game b and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">these kind of ideas is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:57.600" style="s2">bring that together i do know um part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">what this section also is for is for</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.600" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">again the good the bad and the ugly</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">what is currently working the space and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:03.840" style="s2">part of what mark alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:05.919" style="s2">is um that there have been things in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.840" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">space that have either failed or haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.919" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">been quite as</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">picked up by the masses uh the good guy</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:15.600" style="s2">and they were a good site and i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">used them and they gave you a metric</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.600" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">on the social justice the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">and the health impact and um</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">but they weren&#39;t very transparent on</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">what it was they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">they weren&#39;t crowdsourced you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">add new products if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">and because they weren&#39;t transparent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">that you couldn&#39;t add your own</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">products if you and it&#39;s its own app</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">downfall that this is the space i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">been playing in so i have a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">and said i want to give someone else</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">um chance to share what how do you make</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">your purchasing decisions</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">i guess i can go next um</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">i uh and if we&#39;re just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:02.160" style="s2">the the goodwill the company not their</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">like quality of their products because i</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.160" end="00:07:05.520" style="s2">do use like consumer reports i do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">of research when i&#39;m buying technical</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.520" end="00:07:09.759" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">um uh and i do</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">tend to buy from companies whose</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">advertising does claim that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">that they have you know free-range</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">chickens and stuff like that and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">things that i care about</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">um so if they&#39;re signaling to me through</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">their marketing and advertising then i</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:27.599" style="s2">am more likely to purchase</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">if they&#39;re um aligning with my</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.599" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">um my kind of i don&#39;t know morals</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">might be one way to put it um</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">i do not spend a lot of time researching</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">companies and finding third-party</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:42.319" style="s2">sources</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">like uh jubilee was talking about to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">validate their marketing</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">um i you know i do see articles fly by</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">on social media</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">that give me an impression of whether or</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">not i should use a company or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">i am aware that of some specific</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">situations where those social media</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">posts were</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">inaccurate um uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:06.639" style="s2">where i did have to kind of dive in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">decide well am i going to stop using</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.639" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">this tool and then i found out that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">were kind of overblown</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">and then of course i&#39;ve seen issues</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">where a company says that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">all this stuff and they really aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">so i&#39;ve seen it kind of both ways i</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">am not aware of any tools i wasn&#39;t aware</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:23.440" style="s2">of the good guide</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">uh looks interesting even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.440" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">not there anymore um</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know of any resources that do</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:32.959" style="s2">this on that aspect i guess there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">couple websites on specific issues like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.959" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">i believe there&#39;s there are ways to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">oh is this company</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">um good for the environment right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple niche ones that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">i think of but i can&#39;t think of them on</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.240" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">top of my head i think i&#39;ve seen them</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">um so for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">you know i would like something that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">friction um you know like jubilee said</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a full-time job</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">to va to vet every company of every</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">product you use or most</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">products or even the expensive products</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:10.000" style="s2">so keeping that simple and easy um</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;d like to be able to contribute it or</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.000" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re not onto that part of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">presentation but but yeah right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t um i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">um so just through osmosis</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">is kind of how i do those uh get those</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">opinions so that&#39;s today</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">okay well i don&#39;t suppose um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">probably the least likely person he</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">should have here then</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">because basically you go to tesco&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">which is on the corner</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">and um it&#39;s just cheap i have to buy</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">what&#39;s cheap</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">so so basically and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">sort of like finding companies that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">really good for everything can that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">because most most of our see things now</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">is most of the big corporations</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:02.399" style="s2">you come in and buy the the green</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.399" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">the companies that are doing good</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">because people like them so they come in</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">and buy them</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">and then there goes that you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">mean because it it</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s only a few</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">companies that own bloody everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">you know i mean so i think i think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">trail</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">we have behind the company of who owns</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">you know i mean i think i think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">would make a difference um but as i said</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a sort of vote</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">um like this week i&#39;ll live off toast</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">so because i ate shops</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">even before the the pandaric i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">go with them anyway you don&#39;t i&#39;d avoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">it like to play</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">you know i mean that i&#39;ll just do</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">without um but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">i do well do i don&#39;t i i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">um but yeah so uh so i think so like</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">having something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:55.600" style="s2">they could tell you whether the little</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">bunch of bastards or not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.600" end="00:10:59.279" style="s2">just so they put a goody label on</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">because they think they can get more</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.279" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">sales</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:03.680" style="s2">you know what i mean and i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s because there&#39;s no trust really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.680" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s as far as i go with</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">that for this section</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">but you mark how do you currently do</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:18.480" style="s2">this what what</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">meet this need in your life it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.480" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">very very frustrating for me i i</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">and i guess that&#39;s why i&#39;m i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">i feel close ties to this because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">like this is a big one</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">in the game space that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:41.519" style="s2">it would be nice to be able to trust</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">as a consequence of that because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">like somewhat like carrie my</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.240" style="s2">my income has gone down quite a bit but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.240" end="00:12:35.279" style="s2">i&#39;ve done that so i can concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:37.839" style="s2">writing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.279" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">and different things and other things</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.839" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">have happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">but uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">made that conscious decision that i want</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">to be in the space where</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">it&#39;s tilting the word the world towards</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">a better place</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">but i&#39;m frustrated in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">make that decision like what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">good i buy organic eggs i buy</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:06.639" style="s2">organic vegetables just because in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.639" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">organic is better because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">using the big chemical company</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s all i can do now but when</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">somebody says to me</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">well organic is just a big scam because</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">and then they mention a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">well i have no no ground to stand on i&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">new i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">for new jams or jellies actually i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.320" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">a new uh almond flour</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">which we can talk about how bad almonds</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">are for the environment but um</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">and it would then you know take all</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">those search results that you normally</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:41.279" style="s2">get from search engines or</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:44.000" style="s2">from other aggregation sites but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.279" end="00:15:46.720" style="s2">would filter and sort based upon</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.000" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">the values that i have of the companies</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.720" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:53.120" style="s2">produce that and and like carry said</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">all the way up to chain to that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.120" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">company that owns that company and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:57.839" style="s2">such and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">okay and an ideal future would be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">ev all the all the foods produced and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">will be produced locally so you get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">know in the local community</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s doing what where&#39;s it where</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">it coming from you can keep them</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">accountable because you get to know them</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">so you get to trust them</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll be able to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">i recommend these because they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">good they&#39;re doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.040" style="s2">for the community nobody owns them up</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">the chain</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.040" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">and um yeah you get to know but</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:30.480" style="s2">obviously if you could have something</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">like bentley said</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.480" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">to have a sort of like a scanner that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.240" style="s2">could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">but as i said you need to to sort like</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.240" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">make sure that nobody who was doing the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">ratings was getting bought by these</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:43.519" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">to actually go and sit there and click</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.519" end="00:16:47.759" style="s2">forever but um yeah so there&#39;d be none</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">of that so all the big companies would</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.759" end="00:16:51.040" style="s2">go bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">and then everything would revert back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.040" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">local and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:55.680" style="s2">you you&#39;d get all the you know so food</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be getting</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.680" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">taken grown in one place like um</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">somewhere and then taken to thailand for</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">the packaging and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">sent back out again so you&#39;d alleviate</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">all of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">if everything was sort of like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.400" style="s2">get locally and obviously you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">some things that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.400" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">put to be not of getting grown somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">getting sent somewhere for packaging</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s cheap labor</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">and then getting sent back and then sold</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">an uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:23.280" style="s2">place so should we do away with all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.039" style="s2">so i think local</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.280" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">local communities and people would</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.039" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">support local communities and</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">everything else and local farmers and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:31.120" style="s2">and stuff like that and get them away</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.120" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">these big bastards basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">i can go next or can share more if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.600" style="s2">would like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">um so what carrie had shared in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.600" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">beginning that she</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">shops based on price and not liking to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">shop</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">that is very much me as well i went from</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">needing to buy organic and eating that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">to being like well this i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">much i can trust it and i&#39;m really poor</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">and so i want food more than you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">and so i needed to change those values</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">and i think for me a perfect system is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">one that that meets the consumer</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">eat locally like</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">as a canadian and we&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:45.039" style="s2">disagree with each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">but i i&#39;m always worried about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.039" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">eating local movement because i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">wait where do i get almonds and bananas</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">and like there&#39;s a lot that i eat</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">that is can&#39;t really be grown in canada</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">at least with our current infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">but to be able to say my value is i do</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">want to eat locally let&#39;s say 80</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">of my diet comes from local and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">season</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">and then i can choose yes and bananas</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">and almonds and offset them and see the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">full</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">the full actual cost of the supply chain</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">so then i can make better decisions do i</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">really need bananas i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">um and have it as convenient as possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">and one app like one thing that feeds</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">all of that information to and makes it</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">as easy as possible yes taking pictures</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">taking pictures on the conveyor belt</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">where it&#39;s like we noticed you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">buying cheerios here&#39;s an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:32.000" style="s2">that&#39;s more within your values and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.559" style="s2">possibly produced locally</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">and i do think we can be more um more</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.559" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">efficient and see the loopholes</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:39.440" style="s2">of where it makes sense to to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">together and create things like</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.440" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">factories and manufactured goods</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">when we can showcase that there&#39;s a um</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">a cost benefit analysis to it right as</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.679" style="s2">game a as that is like once it makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">when i can stop giving my money to post</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.679" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">for for cheerios and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">we can create cheerios ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">they&#39;re organic and they take care of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">the planet and the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">then i&#39;m gonna switch over and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">really buy cheerios but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">that is um my i&#39;m sure there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">other things but that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">a good a good starting point for my</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">ideal five ten years in the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">i&#39;m also muted to tell you you&#39;re muted</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">mark</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.120" end="00:20:32.400" style="s2">thank you um as you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.159" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">i was um i was i was taking notes so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.400" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">taking those</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">to all of this um some things</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">came up i and um</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">they&#39;re fairly like a consistent thread</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">throughout some of them</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:48.799" style="s2">came up i never never thought of and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.799" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">see see recipes as well i</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">i think well that would be a cool little</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">add-on and maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">is something that could lever this</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">towards something that we never thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:03.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">another thing that you said jubilee was</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.200" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">notice your buying habits and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">why the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">hell would you want that when that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">of the things that um</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of concerned about now but</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">it went back to the trust idea that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">mentioned by everyone as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">so if this was good if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">felt that it was good that it it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">you could see as kerry was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">the big companies and the bastards that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">were buying</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">all buying up all the good ones start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">go bankrupt</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">because of this then you would start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">trust it a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">i i would like to see all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">plus the one app one place for</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">and i would like to see this</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">um i don&#39;t even know what the word for</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">it would be</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">so ideally there would be a module</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">and the module would be created</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">so that and i did a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">programming not a lot of programming</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">but the model would be created so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">uh in in microsoft they have these</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">dynamic linked libraries and things like</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">it would be much more than that it would</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">something that you you would hand to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">companies like a dynamic link libraries</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">fill this out and so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">they would put all that information in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">there but if they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">as transparent as it</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:57.200" style="s2">and the cheapest this cheap matters to</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">me too</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.200" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">like something a good value and i could</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">where all the money was going in one app</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">so i could make my buying decision</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:10.240" style="s2">i want to make i want to feel confident</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t feel confident now</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.240" end="00:23:14.400" style="s2">so i i want to feel confident that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">purchase i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">is really doing all those things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">lifting up</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">the small companies so i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">more readily make that trust that trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">judgment i guess and um</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">it&#39;s making it hard for somebody else to</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">fake and as i go and go around in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">um i see other people doing that same</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">and i see the immediate results of of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">those actions like</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">more local companies um less</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:51.760" style="s2">big companies less driving less</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">less brainwashing less less predatory</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.760" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">marketing</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">because they will see that&#39;s ineffective</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">and they will try and uh emulate or die</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s ideally for me that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">want to see</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">awesome now we can switch over to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">last section because they all kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">together anyway</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:16.559" style="s2">um like everything comes up in the last</p>

<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars just because</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">although there aren&#39;t ten thousand</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.200" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">pretty sure good guide had ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">people using it and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:42.480" style="s2">creating something within that space</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:44.480" style="s2">it&#39;ll just give us more money and people</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.480" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">to play with</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.480" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">so what could we create to help people</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">vote with their wallets with ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">thousand people and a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">dollars and while mark was talking there</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.159" style="s2">was the two</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">the food part and we&#39;ve had solution</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.159" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">raisings on food before</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:00.960" style="s2">it would be instrumental because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.960" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">none of us cannot right we either need</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.640" style="s2">to grow our own or buy it like we</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">we can&#39;t not have food and the other</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.640" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">place i would like to see solutions</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">is in the electronic sphere where</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">there&#39;s basically no real solution but</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">just seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">the supply chain but i feel like those</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:22.080" style="s2">are two different products</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:24.320" style="s2">but creating them in a together tech way</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.080" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">um where there is um</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.320" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">like a central pool of data means in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">future they could be one app</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">but in the that&#39;s where my mind goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">like if it could work for both the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:34.320" style="s2">electronics</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">how do i make this purchase how do i</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.320" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">make sure it lasts and how do we like</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">so i don&#39;t have four laptops all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:42.799" style="s2">which are on their last leg</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">uh and food how do i make sure i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.799" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">getting my body the nutrition it needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">well not hurting the planet</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">and um able to work together to to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">that with corporations that exist</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">and my neighbors and locally</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know what that looks like ten</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">thousand people hundred thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">but what are some ideas that we could do</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.120" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">okay well i&#39;ll i&#39;ll go with ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.600" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">people obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">that you would have a an established</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">right so half of these people would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:19.440" style="s2">interested in maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">becoming investigative reporters to</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.440" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">distribute</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">on them who&#39;s doing what where the when</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t really maybe have time to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.640" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">a lot of people might have time to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">actually go and research the companies</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">and develop that information and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">within that 10 000 there&#39;d be so like</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">someone there who could actually build</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:41.039" style="s2">an app</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">that would be useful and then obviously</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.039" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">within the ten thousand you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:46.559" style="s2">ask them</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">what questions that are important to</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.559" end="00:26:49.120" style="s2">them so</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">you basically have to have something</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.120" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">like reason score um</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">with elections and solution raisins all</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">in one go</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">right so i&#39;d have so like an</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">amalgamation</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:05.120" style="s2">of that but as i said the app would sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:07.760" style="s2">of contain that but you&#39;d obviously need</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.120" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">to give those ten thousand people a say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.760" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">and find out what they do and what</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:13.360" style="s2">they&#39;d be interested in doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">maybe you know like you get these</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.360" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">mystery detectives who go to stores</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:22.320" style="s2">and spy on them or that and then go back</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">you know i mean like mystery shoppers</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.320" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">and stuff like that as well so i think i</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">think if you can marry the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">the tough part with with with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">hundred thousand well as i said if</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">you have ten thousand people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">willing to give you ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">or ten whatever it is a month then as i</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">said by the end of the year you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">1.2 million dollars so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">i think with that money you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">actually create something but obviously</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">and you&#39;d need a community as well with</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">that app because people</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">like to sort of get to know each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">you know i mean and stuff like that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">well so</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:54.720" style="s2">there&#39;d be a lot of resources that might</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">not be thought of that would come</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.720" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">on top of the money as well so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know until you got the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">i suppose that&#39;ll be that&#39;d be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">nice that that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:06.000" style="s2">that would be my idea i love it here i</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re creating all the game</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.000" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">be there</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">focus on which it seems to be happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">more and more often which i both love</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">what can we do at ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">and a hundred thousand dollars to most</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">powerfully help them</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">vote with their wallets right whether</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">they have a say in it or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">what could that look like right what</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">could ten thousand two hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">dollars</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">one of the things feeding off the food</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">piece that i would like the most access</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">is like the good guide actually focuses</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">on food and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">beauty products and household cleaners</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">stuff that have ingredient lists</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">and ingredient lists are readily</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">they&#39;re like legally you have to publish</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.480" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">and the end they have a certain quality</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:49.279" style="s2">to them</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">like if you have fragrance in your</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.279" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">ingredient list that is so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">corporations could get</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">um away with not telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">there&#39;s toxic sludge in here that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">going to give you cancer</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">and hurt your endocrine system and all</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:03.039" style="s2">that because fragrance is just easier</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">than our like</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.039" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">a chemical so</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">rating unless you&#39;re going to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">what that fragrance is we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:16.880" style="s2">assume it&#39;s the toxic ones we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">to assume it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:28.960" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">and then the product is just an</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.960" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">amalgamation of the ingredients and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the case then anyone with</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">expertise can put in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">the ingredient information like is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">how healthy is salt depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">quantity</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">but there&#39;s other things that are more</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">carcinogenic and such that there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">something about dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">ingredient list that then feeds into and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2">anyone can put in ingredients right i</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">can add any product to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">because all i&#39;ve got to do is take a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:54.720" style="s2">picture of the product say what it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">and take a picture of the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.720" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">amalgamation putting those together to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">see what is the health impacts what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">environmental impacts and then the cost</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">right the cost would be different no</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">matter where it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">if i buy it at this superstore versus</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">customers could put that information and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">i could be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">show up on price as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.200" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">so is that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">that&#39;s going all back to kerry&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">the 10 000 investigative reporters</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">actively seeking out that information</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">and putting it into this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">this list is that kind of what you had</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">carried that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">well it will attentive because as i said</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">if you had a it has a network of 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:45.120" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">there&#39;s some people who are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.120" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">have very much time and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">people who are going to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">so the ones with a lot of time you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">get them involved by becoming</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">investigate reporters</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:56.399" style="s2">and then they could report back on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">fine things and that and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.399" end="00:31:01.360" style="s2">ones with with no time</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">um obviously could find other ways of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.360" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">contributing to to what what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">and that no obviously within that</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">network there&#39;d be some</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">programmers somebody wanted to actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">build something</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">so and then like it&#39;d be like a circular</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.640" style="s2">little circular economy within itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">you know what i mean so you could</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.640" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">actually get people to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">to get involved start contributing in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">whatever way</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">they could or whatever way they could</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">you know i mean so i think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">kind of powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:35.200" style="s2">because you&#39;d have people who would</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">actually wanting to do it rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.200" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">somebody oh well you must do this you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">must do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">you know i mean so and i think you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">find a balance there</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.200" style="s2">of the people who are willing to like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">get stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.200" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">you know what i mean and obviously if it</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">benefits them as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.080" style="s2">and then obviously from out of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">we&#39;ll grow all sorts of little</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.080" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">connections and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">crews and teams and all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">you know what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve been having just that 10 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.279" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">people there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">people from all over the place people</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">you find in your local network you might</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">find they actually say oh by the way i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">doing this do you wanna come join me to</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:11.600" style="s2">the people they know</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">you know what i mean so so that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.600" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">that would create a we&#39;d probably end up</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">with an army of lot a lot more people</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">um eventually but like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">obviously we&#39;d go for the ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">first maybe the main</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">main ones but obviously it could grow</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">without even having to try you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:32.559" style="s2">i mean so um</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">but yes that that&#39;d be that&#39;d be quite</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.559" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">good but as i said you&#39;ve got to start</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:36.960" style="s2">somewhere haven&#39;t you so</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">but you would need to structure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.960" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">network to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:42.240" style="s2">to benefit the people who&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">joining</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.240" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">you know i mean so they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">they&#39;re involved and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.760" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">that they&#39;re important for being there</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.000" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">and as i said the contributions that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">they make towards it</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">and you know and because that will</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.039" end="00:32:55.919" style="s2">create a sense of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">between the people and they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.919" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">wanting to share you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">like you see all these detective</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:03.039" style="s2">um sleuths and armchair detectives and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.039" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">and they&#39;re all getting in on it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">i&#39;ve done this and you know i mean they</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">go out searching and stuff just</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">for things you know i mean so and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">think because it affects them</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">in terms of what they&#39;re eating and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">what&#39;s in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">and so much like nobody trusts anybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">anymore especially within the corporate</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">world and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">obviously people who go to shops don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">even like go into these shops but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">know there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">you know walmart has taken all over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">wall you know so they&#39;ve got a monopsony</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">that i found out that the word for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:36.320" style="s2">that way people have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">supply them because they&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.320" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">ones you know i mean so um</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:42.320" style="s2">so yeah so and i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">would would end up and then you&#39;d find</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.320" end="00:33:44.960" style="s2">people who were as little</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">so they wanted to do their own</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.960" end="00:33:49.039" style="s2">businesses within that</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">and go along with it with the the green</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">and helpful for the environment and that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">and it would educate</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">and inspire a whole other things that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">so um so yeah so i&#39;ve just gone off on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">tangent they&#39;d have a like today so shut</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.840" end="00:34:11.200" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">i guess i haven&#39;t um participated yet in</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.200" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">this part</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">um i like all those ideas um</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">so yeah community driven</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">collection of information</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">and you know there&#39;d be it&#39;d have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">supported</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">somehow so people would need to um</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:36.320" style="s2">either pay or contribute data uh do the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.320" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">maybe those people don&#39;t need to pay and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:42.480" style="s2">uh it would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:43.440" style="s2">you know at the level of covering costs</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.480" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.440" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">not uh for profit</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">um in that in the traditional sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.119" end="00:34:58.400" style="s2">profit above all and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">yes figuring out the details i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.400" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">kind of what we laid out is very very</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">complex so the next step would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">kind of like figuring out what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">starting you know what are the steps to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">get to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s where my mind immediately goes</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">so uh we</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve expanded pretty well and then my</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">my natural tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.800" style="s2">start narrowing again so but we may not</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">be ready for that yet</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.800" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">but i think all that all that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">discussed kind of mirrors</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">um the thoughts i&#39;ve had over the last</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:32.720" style="s2">couple weeks during the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">and some things a while back when i said</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.720" end="00:35:37.920" style="s2">oh i wish there was something</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">someplace i could go to actually look up</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.920" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">the information about these companies</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:42.000" style="s2">and products</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">so yeah i guess i don&#39;t have much more</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">to add just uh yes let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">um bentley</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.280" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">you&#39;re you feel that this has gone as</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">wide as it</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">can uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">well uh maybe not i mean sometimes going</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">wider you can you could find a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:11.280" style="s2">brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">thing but i&#39;d i haven&#39;t heard a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.280" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">diversity of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">except i mean we i yeah i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">kind of reached</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">i guess i do think we&#39;ve kind of reached</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">the limit but i could be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">and so now then it&#39;s more of just like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">well which what order do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:28.800" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">building that and gathering people and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.800" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">you know what are the steps</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know i can&#39;t think of anything</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">wider but other people might</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">so if anyone i&#39;m open no no i</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">i no this is important because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">trying to get a feel for it if it&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">wide as you can there are some things i</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">heard here that i didn&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">the last uh solution racing were eight</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">year old</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">and jubilee was there someone else it</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">was just three of you right you were</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:56.160" style="s2">talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:58.160" style="s2">there were some and i think it was an</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">idea from that too as well but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.160" end="00:37:03.680" style="s2">some new things here</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">um that thing that kerry was talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.680" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">oh yeah kerry was there on that one</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:11.760" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2">yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">the whole idea of the circular economy</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">within itself that&#39;s that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">um the the people as</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">investigative reporters i was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">touched on but this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">this is much bigger it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">like a minefield area</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">because how do you know and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">restrict so that when somebody put</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">something in that you can trust that</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">information so how do you how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:48.000" style="s2">but i mean if you can empower them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">say you&#39;re an active piece of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.000" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">i think that is is kind of a cool and</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">powerful thing that might drive this</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">all on its own um so i think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">that&#39;s huge and that wasn&#39;t we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">kind of have that before so and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a few more things in here when</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:07.599" style="s2">you talk about trusting ingredient lists</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">what what what that would look like and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.599" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">having people</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">um if they don&#39;t put the actual</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">chemicals on the list</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">then they get a low score type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of my new show but</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">so mark i i can&#39;t expand it a little</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">more if you want</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">sure yeah so and so it depends on where</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">you want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">draw the line because uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">uh adriel is working on wikilection and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">he has two other needs for a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">similar concept</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">which is politicians who are you going</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">to vote for right it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:45.040" style="s2">buying with your wallet so the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">of logical structure and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">system could be used to look is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">fault</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:53.839" style="s2">politician voting based upon my values</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">and then should i vote for that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.839" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">politician or should i</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">protest or or send them letters and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">and then similar to the product space</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">which i wasn&#39;t sure how much we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">to go down on like the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">but i&#39;m working with a group on no code</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of new</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">technology in this space where people</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">can kind of build their own</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">technology products without having to</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:23.040" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">actually how to write code there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">of technologies you have to plug them up</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">together in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">and sometimes the feature you want on</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:31.760" style="s2">one thing doesn&#39;t go to the other so</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">but it has the same sort of thing as</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.760" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">like i need to balance price</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">and features uh and quality</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">um in a decision um but</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">those that that one&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">making the world a better place it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">very game a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">the the wiki election is very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">um but i i do think there&#39;s a need for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">generic</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">tool that says we as a community want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.240" style="s2">take these entities whether people or</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">products or companies</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.240" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">and organizations and we want to rate</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">them on certain features</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">and then i want to be able to choose a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">feature set that&#39;s important to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">and i guess i hadn&#39;t said this in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">thing but also be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">to rank those so like let&#39;s say i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">really care about the environment but</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">local is not that important to me but</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">this other person is like it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.640" style="s2">local and you know i don&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">the environment&#39;s that bad with some</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.640" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know many people that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">but let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">um then they would get a different</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">set so i guess the part we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:38.800" style="s2">mention was customizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">the um the result based upon my values</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.800" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">we probably touched on it but just be</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">more explicit so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">you know so i&#39;ve been thinking this last</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">week to build a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">you know some open open source code that</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">build these sort of group feature</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">decision making group aggregate of data</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">but then individuals can make</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:04.839" style="s2">decisions uh based off of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the slightly bigger</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">scope</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:09.359" style="s2">hey thank you</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">it&#39;s really kind of a new wiki for</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">because for me having i know we do not</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">have 10 000 people but</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.119" style="s2">getting the threshold of people so you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">can ask</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.119" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">them what they like what we just did</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">right how do you vote with your dollar</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">do you care about it at a company level</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">or a product level</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">and the answer for me is both but at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">same time which one is technology</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">technologically</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">better to access for like the cons the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">right am i going to look up a company or</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">am i going to look up a product i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">look up a product because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:51.760" style="s2">i&#39;m deciding to buy</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">and the products have the ingredient</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">information on them but that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">my assumption is one person extrapolated</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">to ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually asking ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">people and being like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">would this work for no that sounds way</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">too hard i&#39;m not going to take out my</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">app and scan things i will take a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">picture of the serial aisle yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">sounds easy enough for me</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">that there&#39;s feedback into it so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">whatever the first part is</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.960" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">if people aren&#39;t using it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">reason why because i know when i was</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">using the good guide the fact that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:23.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t able to put in products</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">i&#39;m like oh this isn&#39;t in here i okay i</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.280" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">can&#39;t even tag it i can&#39;t even be like</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:29.200" style="s2">could you put this</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">in it&#39;s just not in there and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.200" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t again they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.160" style="s2">transparent on what it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:35.359" style="s2">and i feel like that&#39;s possibly i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.160" end="00:42:36.880" style="s2">think they would sell it because they</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.359" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">got bought and then put on the shelf so</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.880" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">i&#39;m definitely sure they wouldn&#39;t sell</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">us their information for a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:41.839" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">but that is part of what is like with</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.839" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">thousand dollars maybe it&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">ten dollars a month</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">maybe it is that one point two million</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">right maybe it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">years wage to buy it from them and be</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">like hey we have ten thousand people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">put in ten dollars a month we&#39;ll buy it</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:57.200" style="s2">over the next year and use your data and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">use that</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.200" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to make it fully</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">transparent i don&#39;t think i think the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">old good guide would have sold it to us</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the new good guide would</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">because they were basically bought by a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:09.119" style="s2">right wing</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">we don&#39;t want this to exist but we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.119" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">to oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.280" style="s2">which shows that they were powerful</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">and so like like you mentioned like i</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">think it&#39;d be difficult to get down like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">you said if it&#39;s not in there and you</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:25.520" style="s2">can put it in there but still if you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:27.599" style="s2">in there 90</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.520" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">is not in there there&#39;s no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.599" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">getting any value out of putting the</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">stuff in there for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.079" style="s2">everything you&#39;ve put in you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">about you put it in you already have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.079" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">um uh so</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">um so yes that&#39;s kind of the tough thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:44.480" style="s2">and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:45.520" style="s2">just kind of as a short step to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.480" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.520" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">if you scan it in or take a picture of</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">the aisle maybe we can pull out well</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually pretty that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">technologically possible but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">challenging code too but</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">like let&#39;s say you&#39;re shopping online</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">and it was just a plug-in that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">you&#39;re you see like even the the google</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">go product results it would highlight</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">ones that</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">were the companies meet your values but</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure about the products yet</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">and that would be the first iteration</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">and later on we go down to the products</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">so it&#39;d still probably be at the product</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">level that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">like julie like said that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">people are actually integrating with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">thing it just we just</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">it just may be a while before we get</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">down to that level of data but</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">yeah but maybe it&#39;s not useful until you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">get down to that level of data</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.119" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">well i i when when i think about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s if it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">i guess you guys can weigh in on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">is to me the the first primary use would</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">in in putting small companies in there</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">so the smaller ones that we kind of have</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:56.880" style="s2">an idea that they&#39;re doing the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">thing anyways</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.880" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">and the local companies in here so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">what the 10 000 people could do is</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">um fill out this module</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">and start with the smallest companies</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">so your your efforts as part of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">army is to to get us</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">a hundred thousand small companies</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">and hopefully from that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">we can have a kind of a movement where</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">start buying with their wallets because</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">this app will show them</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll start with these smaller companies</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">we will</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">we could present those modules to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">larger companies and say</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">if you fill these out you&#39;ll become</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">part of this this it&#39;s kind of a larger</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">buying group and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why the good guy didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">around much i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">i didn&#39;t find why was it not on my radar</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">you know because i i was</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">buying consciously and i was constantly</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:10.800" style="s2">places where i could find that but if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:15.599" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.800" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">10 000</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.599" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">people that were active in this like</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">could that grow to 100</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.680" style="s2">000 and if so then what what would that</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">look like what would it take</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.680" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">to have it grow to 100 000 concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">on the smaller companies</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">and then allowing for the larger</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">to become part of that list</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s how it will grow</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">so then</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">the companies that got on there first</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">would receive a larger a better score</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">companies that had a greater</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">transparency would</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">receive a better score and then this so</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">this app would show it all to you would</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">where all the ones closest locally to</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">and there would be a way to put that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">information in but it would have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.480" style="s2">vetted in some way i&#39;m not sure how so</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.480" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">we know that the information going in um</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">a marketplace kind of platform</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:20.640" style="s2">like i know you can create your own</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">marketplace on that for the green</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.640" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">for the ones who we actually trust uh so</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">that you know not not</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">screwing them out loads of money for</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">just being there but they could go in</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">and maybe they could pay a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">subscription that would help towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">keeping you know the marketplace or they</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">could pay towards the marketplace in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">of you know um something like that as</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">well so i&#39;m just talking shit now so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:47.920" style="s2">yeah like i think but i think in in when</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:50.559" style="s2">i envisioned this</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">i envisioned this as a marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.559" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">when you were talking about it before</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">you talked you talked about i think your</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.000" style="s2">words were</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">a circular economy within itself and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.000" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">um um the people are</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">willing to do what they are good at and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">so what they&#39;re good at and want to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">is maybe as a small</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.119" end="00:48:15.520" style="s2">company want to market with and get</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">their supplies from a company that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.520" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">see everything about</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.200" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">you know that so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.319" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">marketplace would be created anyways</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">does that make sense kerry the closest</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:31.520" style="s2">thing again</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">now to a marketplace is harrison and</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.520" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">colleen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">project i think which is like an online</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">market an online farmers market</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">that can be franchised to any local city</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">it just needs someone to come they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">not very technical like</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not a beautiful website it&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:49.760" style="s2">old-looking</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">but something about like those two</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.760" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">meeting of okay well there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">farmer&#39;s market that already exists that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">is very local but the people have to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">and sit there</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:58.800" style="s2">for you know all of saturday after</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve picked their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.800" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s you know do i know that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:04.000" style="s2">local gem is or i don&#39;t know all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">same things we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.000" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">but to be able to put like if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">marketplace we&#39;re looking to create</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">then we need to start from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">marketplace which means starting from</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:15.119" style="s2">people producing the goods and saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">what is stopping you right is it the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.119" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">marketing is it the customers</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:20.880" style="s2">is it the um transportation that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">have to compete with right people are</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.880" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">coming to the farmers market they bring</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">goods home how do you get them if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">don&#39;t stay in the farmer&#39;s market how do</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">you get the bits to them</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">and meeting the needs of the small</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">businesses in a way that works for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">consumer</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">um that is that price triangle right how</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">the expense which is maybe not what</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:38.480" style="s2">we&#39;re sticking with but it&#39;s still there</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">the convenience and the quality</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.480" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">and asking the um</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">like i feel like the transparency of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">farmer&#39;s market is kind of where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know what i mean i i know</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">that if the far people are there at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">farmer&#39;s market the farmer&#39;s market has</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">vetted them a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">um and then i can ask questions of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">and start that relationship and having</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">that online farmers market that online</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">and then starting that dialogue to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">well here&#39;s what i can wait wait did you</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">spray the blueberries i want to know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">like yes i did on this day and like well</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:10.960" style="s2">how can we get a bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:12.559" style="s2">like starting with something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.960" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">harrison and colleen&#39;s and then but</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.559" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">again that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">food it might be i might um</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">maybe need a little clarification when</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re saying market</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:23.760" style="s2">because when i think of market i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.760" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">place where you&#39;re actually doing the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">transactions</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">which for me creates a barrier of entry</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">for the businesses if they have to put</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:36.559" style="s2">their inventory</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:38.839" style="s2">or their sales through this channel then</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.559" end="00:50:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a high barrier</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:45.119" style="s2">um so i would rather start with an</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.000" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">information platform and then if we</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.119" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">want if people want to start selling on</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:50.240" style="s2">it then that would be a second that</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">would be the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.240" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">a later step um</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">that&#39;s a good idea like all the together</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">text of all of the stuff coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">game b it&#39;s like there&#39;s this miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">future technology blah that like solves</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">but they like it&#39;s all chicken and egg</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">and that it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">approaching it from different places</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">like do we need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.599" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">company product or market start with one</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:19.920" style="s2">of them they&#39;ll all come</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing with any of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.920" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">projects is it&#39;s like right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.280" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">solving that 10 years down the road</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">but right now it&#39;s like start with one</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">thing and then yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">it will grow into this beautiful bluff</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">later but yeah except the company review</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">side is 20 thousand dollars a market is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">a hundred thousand dollars and uh you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">the the cost between those several</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:41.040" style="s2">solutions are dramatically exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:42.720" style="s2">different and i know there are tools to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.040" end="00:51:44.079" style="s2">build a quote market but then you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.720" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">to market the market</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.079" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">and it takes a lot of effort so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">total effort is still higher even though</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">the cost of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:54.000" style="s2">that specific tool is low so i</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:55.359" style="s2">i think we can do all those things but i</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.000" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.359" end="00:52:02.720" style="s2">just pick one at the pick the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">is the easy the lowest effort won first</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.720" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">and build</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">and i think that would be uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.280" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">that would be by i think that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.079" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">a company although mark&#39;s idea of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">starting with small</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">companies is something i&#39;d never thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">of and now the more i think about the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">better that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:27.920" style="s2">is because it hits on exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">what we want to accomplish it gives</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.920" end="00:52:31.359" style="s2">people a good feeling like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">detectives that kerry brought up</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.359" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">is that they&#39;re promoting a local</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:36.319" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:37.760" style="s2">when they do this so there&#39;s value in</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">doing it even if you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.760" end="00:52:40.480" style="s2">anything out of it right</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">so now we have value for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.480" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">participants we have value for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">business and we have value for the users</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:47.599" style="s2">all made</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">with without a high bar we don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.599" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have every small business</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:52.559" style="s2">and the whole word for this</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">provide value if i go in and i find two</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.559" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">and my whole dfw metroplex of millions</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a value to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s i don&#39;t know i was intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">by that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.000" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;d be interesting even in vancouver to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">know even if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">food and just local what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">like what and that was where like</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">calling that&#39;s what colleen and harrison</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:18.559" style="s2">kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">but for their local one and then they</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.559" end="00:53:21.920" style="s2">figured out that you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">they have a process i think to work</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.920" end="00:53:27.359" style="s2">through to when you franchise it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">um and there are local</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.359" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">growing co-ops and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">so you could even kind of put the data</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:38.240" style="s2">in for just those and you&#39;d cover</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">a wide variety i i&#39;d look to see to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.240" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">sure there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">that this already isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s almost too easy but</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">again the problem with all the mvps is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">they already exist they&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2">happened and they already failed</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:53.680" style="s2">but if we&#39;re creating something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:55.920" style="s2">gets better and better and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.680" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">creating it with the threshold of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.920" end="00:53:58.319" style="s2">then you don&#39;t have the same problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:53:59.680" style="s2">they did but we</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">right now have all the same problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.680" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">they did yeah so maybe one of the steps</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:06.319" style="s2">would be for us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">research the past experiments and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">digest that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">learnings now yeah definitely</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">i i was writing as as everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">speaking so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">there there&#39;s a couple of things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:24.960" style="s2">that that jumped out at me</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:28.240" style="s2">is it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.960" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">jubilee and kerry you you you really</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.240" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a fire in you for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">marketing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">could occur within the space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">created</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:40.600" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think i think that marketing</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">can still go on</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.600" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">and and maybe it&#39;s even more effective</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">be it doesn&#39;t have to be closed within</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">that space but it can be begun within</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">that space so you can say</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">here&#39;s everything about us just take a</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">look at us and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">and you can go down the rabbit hole and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:04.160" style="s2">find out everything about a company</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">and then i&#39;m you find out everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.160" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">about it here in hollow chain</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:09.920" style="s2">when i i just went on their site and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:12.240" style="s2">have a look at it again</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">it can provide a lot of that just one</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.240" end="00:55:16.240" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">but then all of a sudden now you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.240" end="00:55:19.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">this is how this is a snapshot of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.599" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">in real time if anything changes</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">it becomes gray and some things change</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">trust the same way until it&#39;s cleared up</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">but if we can have that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">then that is a really really good place</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">to do marketing</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">kind of outside of that space but it can</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">be the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:39.839" style="s2">actual contact and the actual trust can</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">be established there</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.839" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">and then you go out of the space to just</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">finish it up</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:46.720" style="s2">iron the details outside and then later</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">on maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.720" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">because because everything is there</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">later on</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:54.160" style="s2">you can build those kind of smart</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:55.359" style="s2">contracts and well holochain does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.160" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">anyways but</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.359" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">you can do that later on because and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.520" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what you do</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">is you build it just like tesla builds</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.520" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">cards now that so they</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">they can all be self-driving all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.520" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:10.079" style="s2">could possibly be built with those</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">for to create those contracts and</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:16.079" style="s2">exchange funds</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">right within the market but that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.079" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have that in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">you just start with the small companies</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:24.000" style="s2">and and they get</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">all the benefit and everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.000" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">you want to give</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">personal time uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">priority on the space especially for if</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">they go</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">as transparent as possible and all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.319" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:41.119" style="s2">will promote them to the top and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:43.359" style="s2">would know so if we had 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.119" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">doing two of these</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">you know all of a sudden you&#39;d have 20</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">000 small build businesses around the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">world that you would know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">everything about and that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">a powerful start for you</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">yeah and like if we solved marketing</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">then finding those ten thousand be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.160" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">there&#39;s ten thousand people out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:04.400" style="s2">easily who would be willing to put in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">time to just research two companies</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.400" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">especially if it wasn&#39;t super arduous</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.119" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:10.799" style="s2">um but how do you find those ten</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.119" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">thousand people right marketing but like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.799" end="00:57:12.799" style="s2">we have to solve marketing if we get</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">marketing</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.799" end="00:57:17.760" style="s2">but um so we&#39;re at the hour for sure um</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">i&#39;d like to go around and share what you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">think is the most powerful thing we</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:21.440" style="s2">could do</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:23.599" style="s2">that we&#39;ve talked about or that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:24.799" style="s2">you in the moment that is within the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.599" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">umbrella of um</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.799" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">not needing more than 10 000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">100 000</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">to start it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">i can start um so i i would like to</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:38.240" style="s2">start a small business directory based</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">on what mark</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.240" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">said that starts um</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">allowing you to filter those small</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">businesses also by your</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">um by your values um</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">but um so i&#39;d like to build that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">directory as a start</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">and and i think that could be done</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">within those constraints easily</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">and populated with enough info to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:11.440" style="s2">provide sustainable value</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">absolute opposite i love that idea but</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.440" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">i&#39;m also the opposite row</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">of like a place where i could put in</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">ingredients where there&#39;s 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:19.839" style="s2">who can take a picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:20.400" style="s2">ingredients because then we have at</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.839" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.400" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">same thing 10 000 products is at least</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">what you&#39;re starting with um</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">to look at does it if it doesn&#39;t contain</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">something i care about then</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s as easy as taking a picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">product and taking a picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">ingredient list</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">and um doing the work only for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.160" style="s2">ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">just is salt good it&#39;s all bad where</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.160" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">does it normally come from until the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">company can prove it</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">does it not through that that horrible</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">method then you get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">verbal metric that having just a space</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.000" end="00:58:48.559" style="s2">for ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:50.559" style="s2">leads into a lot of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.559" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">but company and ingredients one or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.559" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">together about you carrie and mark what</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">do you think is the most powerful one</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just typing here um</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:05.760" style="s2">i i i go back to um i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">conglomerate of what everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:11.119" style="s2">saying the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">just having something where</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.119" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">we could put in get those 10 000</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">investigative reporters putting in as</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:24.960" style="s2">much information as they can</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.200" end="00:59:25.920" style="s2">and and make it make it something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.960" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">doable for them</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.920" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">something that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">and so we have that list what bentley</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:36.480" style="s2">said makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">um but also make it where it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.480" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s expandable so</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">we we have the code in there so we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:44.559" style="s2">expand to put</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:48.160" style="s2">all those other things in there but uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">start with the the modules get uh ten</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.160" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">thousand people doing uh two companies</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">and so we have those products on there</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">we have the modules</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">the companies can if they change can</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">update it and then we have our ten</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">thousand investigators look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:02.240" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">must change if people are actually doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.240" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">what they say</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">well yeah i&#39;d like him that and um</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:13.200" style="s2">what bentley said about the directory</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:14.400" style="s2">but i think with that would come a</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">library</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.400" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">a library guide of how to&#39;s how to go</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:19.760" style="s2">and investigate a company how to make</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:21.119" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.760" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">that you&#39;re finding out you know what i</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">mean because i think if you give them</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">because if you said to everybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">who you knew would you be interested in</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">in finding out</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">what what a company says is what it says</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">on the tin</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">but also in a way that&#39;s so they&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:37.280" style="s2">for the environment</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:38.960" style="s2">because i think you&#39;ll find there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.280" end="01:00:41.440" style="s2">thousands of people out there</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.960" end="01:00:42.880" style="s2">who are just getting so pissed off with</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.440" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">being bullshitted</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.880" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">about everything that they if they could</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">take it into their own hands and have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">how-to guide and have people who they</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:53.280" style="s2">knew we were doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">that would be really good for them so</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:58.000" style="s2">that would help in in developing</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">the the app and and the questions and</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.000" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">everything else as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">and having something like a directory</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">and a wii guide</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">you know what i mean and this is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">project we&#39;re doing and this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">want to do are you look for this and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">create the mailing list and then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">know i mean then that starts</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">you know what i mean like a boot camp</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">for the um the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.680" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">the um what what did you call them</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.839" end="01:01:24.160" style="s2">depending investigative reporters</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">i like the ideas similar to what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:27.520" style="s2">trying to do with solution raising</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.359" style="s2">of um like trickle in and somehow we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.520" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">get 10 000 people that actually aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.359" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:32.720" style="s2">actually kind of works for a company</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">directory</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.720" end="01:01:35.119" style="s2">because instead of you&#39;re paying ten</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">dollars a month or ten dollars per</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.119" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">project which i&#39;m still doing solutions</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:41.520" style="s2">is still powerful and awesome but</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">having right like if i sign up to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.520" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">first four</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">if i&#39;m committing to do one company a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">month i don&#39;t know how hard it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">um right then like in a year we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:55.680" style="s2">12 if i&#39;m only one person i 48 if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">all four you don&#39;t like that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.680" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">i just do whatever that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">to um keep adding that information</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:06.640" style="s2">yes the information is going to change</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:08.400" style="s2">but if the business is still in business</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.640" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">which is maybe actually that&#39;s in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.400" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">time period a little little risky but</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">like that&#39;s there&#39;s still the directory</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">it&#39;s building</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">or in if you&#39;d started with products</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">then starting that right i&#39;m putting 10</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">a month until we will not launch until</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">we have x amount right</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.960" style="s2">company director we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">launch until we have 10 000 or 20 000</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.960" end="01:02:29.280" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">well well what i was going to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.280" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">because i&#39;m building a kind of a project</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">listed site</p>
