<p begin="00:00:05.850" end="00:00:09.870" style="s2">to talk to you about today is what every</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:11.639" style="s2">culture designer absolutely needs to</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.870" end="00:00:14.070" style="s2">know which is the way that ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:18.359" style="s2">arises in a society and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">review this book agne Tala G the making</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.359" end="00:00:23.029" style="s2">and unmaking of ignorance edited by</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">Robert Procter &amp; linda Schwab anger and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.029" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">this is a book about a new field of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">scholarship agnate ology which is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">study of how ignorant arises in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.550" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">societies and the reason this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">extremely important is because ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">is something that can create it be</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:40.110" style="s2">created as a form of knowledge so let me</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:41.940" style="s2">give you an example back in the early</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.110" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">days of cancer research it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.940" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">discovered that there was a link between</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:49.320" style="s2">smoking and lung cancer and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">tobacco industry started to set up fake</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">research firms to intentionally spread</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:55.829" style="s2">misinformation about the science so what</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">they did was they took a type of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.829" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">knowledge that was factually incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">and spreaded in society so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:05.430" style="s2">stuck in people&#39;s minds making them</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">ignorant of the real knowledge of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.430" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">science what the science was actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">saying so this process of designing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">creating ignorance is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">very very important for us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:19.890" style="s2">as changemakers so more recently there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">also been the the work over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.890" end="00:01:25.080" style="s2">decades where billions of dollars have</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:26.610" style="s2">been spent by oil companies to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.080" end="00:01:28.650" style="s2">people and miss inform them about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">threats and the findings of climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.650" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">science in the same way this is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:35.610" style="s2">creating ignorance because the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">that gets spread which is valued</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.610" end="00:01:40.710" style="s2">judgments beliefs assumptions assertions</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:43.020" style="s2">about what the science does or does not</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.710" end="00:01:45.509" style="s2">say that actually gets in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.020" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">people knowing what is actually going on</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.509" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">so one of our challenges as culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2">designers is to take this understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">of AG matala G or the scholarly work</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">studying how ignorance is created in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">society and then applying that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:04.619" style="s2">to help the ideas that are needed for</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">society to thrive and to have resilience</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.619" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">for those ideas to spread so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">other things that I really liked in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">book in particular was the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:15.659" style="s2">described how different</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:17.400" style="s2">ways of creating ignorance have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.659" end="00:02:19.739" style="s2">used as kind of case studies throughout</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.400" end="00:02:22.230" style="s2">history so yes it goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.739" end="00:02:24.299" style="s2">philip morris story of lung cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.230" end="00:02:26.459" style="s2">its connection to smoking and also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.299" end="00:02:28.379" style="s2">disinformation and misinformation around</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.459" end="00:02:30.629" style="s2">climate science but it also looks at</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.379" end="00:02:32.220" style="s2">more subtle issues that are equally</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.629" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">important for making the transition to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.220" end="00:02:38.010" style="s2">sustainability such as the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:39.560" style="s2">view and comprehend human sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.010" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">gender differences between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.560" end="00:02:44.430" style="s2">so one of the ways that ignorance was</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:48.150" style="s2">pervasive throughout most of medical</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.430" end="00:02:50.549" style="s2">history was in the confusion and I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.150" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">say the attention being directed away</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.549" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">from understanding female sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">which turns out to be very important for</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">maintaining systems of dominance and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2">oppression against women and patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.670" end="00:03:04.739" style="s2">systems of power so the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">ignorance was maintained about female</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.739" end="00:03:10.040" style="s2">sexuality in the female body was part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:13.409" style="s2">a larger system of oppression that kept</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.040" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">patriarchal masculine dominance with mom</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.409" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">types of worldviews and hierarchies in</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:21.630" style="s2">place so this book explores the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">mechanisms and methods by which this</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.630" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">ignorance is created how it&#39;s maintained</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">how its spread and I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">extremely important resource for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">who wants to understand how to help the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">ideas spread that humanity will need</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:38.489" style="s2">which is exactly what culture design</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">focuses on doing so this is a great book</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.489" end="00:03:42.629" style="s2">as a foundational text for anyone that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.620" end="00:03:45.239" style="s2">wants to understand how ignorance is</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.629" end="00:03:47.190" style="s2">created as a body of knowledge and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.239" end="00:03:49.199" style="s2">we can do about it so I hope you go out</p>
