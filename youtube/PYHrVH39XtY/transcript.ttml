<p begin="00:00:49.149" end="00:00:53.890" style="s2">other interests under the auspices of</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.890" end="00:00:58.449" style="s2">into the things including the manner and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.899" end="00:01:00.519" style="s2">degree by which products and systems</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.449" end="00:01:03.609" style="s2">design influences culture and ecology</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.519" end="00:01:05.500" style="s2">and he explores the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.609" end="00:01:07.420" style="s2">interface between the organic and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.500" end="00:01:09.759" style="s2">inorganic particularly has realized the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.420" end="00:01:13.060" style="s2">relationship between concept and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.759" end="00:01:14.649" style="s2">computation and he also researches the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.060" end="00:01:16.509" style="s2">manner models by which effective</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.649" end="00:01:18.700" style="s2">personal and social governance could</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.509" end="00:01:20.229" style="s2">potentially be achieved and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.700" end="00:01:22.300" style="s2">on his research side he&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.229" end="00:01:25.270" style="s2">philosopher with some serious work in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.300" end="00:01:27.099" style="s2">both ethics and metaphysics big stuff</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.270" end="00:01:28.420" style="s2">but we&#39;re for it we go there why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.099" end="00:01:31.720" style="s2">you tell us just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.420" end="00:01:33.130" style="s2">Magic Flight well as you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.720" end="00:01:35.140" style="s2">organic and inorganic so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.130" end="00:01:37.750" style="s2">woodworking company and so we try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.140" end="00:01:40.030" style="s2">emphasize the use of materials that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.750" end="00:01:42.160" style="s2">renewable experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.030" end="00:01:43.780" style="s2">essentially very much first person not</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.160" end="00:01:45.429" style="s2">necessarily defined in terms of some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.780" end="00:01:47.739" style="s2">interface or some compute boundary and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.429" end="00:01:50.050" style="s2">to really basically look at what are</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.739" end="00:01:50.979" style="s2">very very clear and simple solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.050" end="00:01:53.950" style="s2">what would otherwise be difficult</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.979" end="00:01:55.569" style="s2">problems so in effect you know design</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.950" end="00:01:56.970" style="s2">has a lot of interesting challenges</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.569" end="00:01:59.379" style="s2">associated with it so we try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.970" end="00:02:01.060" style="s2">essentially go beyond just a traditional</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.379" end="00:02:03.550" style="s2">methods of thinking about design look at</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.060" end="00:02:05.289" style="s2">you know tried-and-true but also to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.550" end="00:02:07.270" style="s2">really bring that forward and to learn</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.289" end="00:02:09.729" style="s2">what is the complete system solution in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.270" end="00:02:11.980" style="s2">the space of problem solving so Magic</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.729" end="00:02:13.569" style="s2">Flight looks at that from a point of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.980" end="00:02:14.920" style="s2">view of you know how can we do this when</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.569" end="00:02:17.230" style="s2">the industrial design how can I do this</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.920" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">with various kinds of tooling what is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:21.099" style="s2">like to talk about the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:22.380" style="s2">employee and the experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.099" end="00:02:24.690" style="s2">customer and an integrated way</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.380" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">so we don&#39;t really believe that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.690" end="00:02:27.630" style="s2">are necessary trade-offs between those</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:29.100" style="s2">kinds of things a lot of times we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.630" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">find design solutions that allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">get all that we want and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">what we strive for that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">beyond your business life you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">on some of the biggest issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">world what is your motivation how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">see the current state of the world you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">know what is it that&#39;s motivating you do</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">the work that you do well in short I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2">have a great regard for the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:52.920" style="s2">being alive at all so in effect I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">consider to be able to breathe and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:56.820" style="s2">look at the Stars and have an experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">of awe to be you know really a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.820" end="00:03:01.770" style="s2">fundamental gift and so I think that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">one sense you know I&#39;m wanting to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.770" end="00:03:05.370" style="s2">service to have you know essentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.480" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">other life other people be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:08.190" style="s2">experience that gift as well so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">thinking about our children in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.190" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">future and such like that so I guess you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:14.670" style="s2">could say that in a fundamental way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">really in service to nature I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.670" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">service to the future of humanity into</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">thinking about those things in a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:24.120" style="s2">strong way so I you know I love I love</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:25.200" style="s2">the wild I love to preserve you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:27.180" style="s2">essentially really good healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.200" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">experiences and to essentially preserve</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.180" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">the capacity for us to to thrive I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:33.740" style="s2">that it&#39;s not necessarily the case that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">you know we have to have some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.740" end="00:03:37.710" style="s2">again trade-off between human well-being</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">and natural well-being I think both can</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.710" end="00:03:41.370" style="s2">be achieved in a really good way and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">that that&#39;s a lot of what I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.370" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">is you know what motivates me what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:47.520" style="s2">what is it that I&#39;m really passionate</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">about how could would create thriving in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.520" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">the long term not just in a short term</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">but for the next thousand years how can</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">we make it so that you know the world is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">a genuinely beautiful place and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:58.830" style="s2">genuinely healthy place to live in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">that people really like being here what</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.830" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">do you make of the you know the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">status quo the way the world is</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:06.600" style="s2">currently operating with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:08.070" style="s2">those goals well I don&#39;t think I need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.600" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">go very far to say it doesn&#39;t look very</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:12.660" style="s2">good right now a lot of our choice</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:13.740" style="s2">making processes is not grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.660" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">things that actually have a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.740" end="00:04:17.190" style="s2">stance in fact they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:19.680" style="s2">optimized very well for short-term</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.190" end="00:04:21.270" style="s2">stance and so in effect when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.680" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">the choice making that is happening in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.270" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">the world today and the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:27.000" style="s2">we&#39;re building things I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">lost opportunities a lot of lost you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:30.810" style="s2">know resources that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">squandered we are currently in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.810" end="00:04:33.449" style="s2">situation where there&#39;s tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:36.360" style="s2">opportunity and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.449" end="00:04:39.210" style="s2">even on yeah we&#39;re on an epoch it seems</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.360" end="00:04:40.979" style="s2">to me where the future is ours it could</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.210" end="00:04:43.349" style="s2">be more glorious than anything most</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.979" end="00:04:45.419" style="s2">humans have ever imagined or it could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.349" end="00:04:47.669" style="s2">the worst of disasters and it&#39;s all up</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.419" end="00:04:49.830" style="s2">to us pretty much and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.669" end="00:04:51.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real choice here I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.830" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">mean we can either go into a dystopia or</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.839" end="00:04:56.159" style="s2">we can make the world a healthier place</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:57.809" style="s2">to be in so in effect we kind of have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.159" end="00:05:00.389" style="s2">know how to make a choice like that like</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.809" end="00:05:01.949" style="s2">what does it mean to to to be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.389" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">of the values from which we&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.949" end="00:05:06.150" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll get to that in a minute but</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:09.240" style="s2">before we do I actually doable it&#39;ll bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.150" end="00:05:11.099" style="s2">into your work on philosophy and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.240" end="00:05:14.159" style="s2">thought some of that might be useful to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.099" end="00:05:16.409" style="s2">surface as a foundation let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.159" end="00:05:17.789" style="s2">your thinking about ethics to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.409" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">that I understood it and I am by no</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.789" end="00:05:22.550" style="s2">means a philosopher you seem to make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:25.889" style="s2">distinction between ethics which was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.550" end="00:05:27.569" style="s2">essentially a fundamental process for</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.889" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">thinking about the world and morality</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.569" end="00:05:32.009" style="s2">which is more arbitrary and defined</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:34.379" style="s2">within a specific domain could you say a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.009" end="00:05:35.219" style="s2">little bit more about those so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.379" end="00:05:37.889" style="s2">bit like the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.219" end="00:05:41.610" style="s2">principles and rules so a principle</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.889" end="00:05:43.649" style="s2">effectively is is a general sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.610" end="00:05:45.060" style="s2">heuristic that we say okay well if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.649" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">in a world where these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.060" end="00:05:48.120" style="s2">are the case then it&#39;s probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">be important for us to think about these</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.120" end="00:05:52.370" style="s2">kinds of issues and so in effect when</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:54.899" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at rules we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.370" end="00:05:57.560" style="s2">things which are very very specific to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.899" end="00:06:00.089" style="s2">particular situation so say you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.560" end="00:06:01.979" style="s2">email form or something like that a rule</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.089" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">might be don&#39;t type everything in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.979" end="00:06:04.709" style="s2">capital letters because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.169" style="s2">distinguish between common words like</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.709" end="00:06:09.300" style="s2">polish and polish and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.169" end="00:06:11.159" style="s2">there&#39;s these sort of background ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.300" end="00:06:13.620" style="s2">that are very very general that get</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.159" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">translated into specific ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.620" end="00:06:17.189" style="s2">relevant within a particular context of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:18.930" style="s2">communication and when I say</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.189" end="00:06:20.219" style="s2">communication I&#39;m thinking of all forms</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:22.589" style="s2">of communication you know physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.219" end="00:06:23.849" style="s2">action building things driving down the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.589" end="00:06:25.050" style="s2">street you know all of those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.849" end="00:06:27.569" style="s2">interactions can be thought of as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.050" end="00:06:30.870" style="s2">communication between self and world in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.569" end="00:06:33.569" style="s2">a general way so if I&#39;m going to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.870" end="00:06:36.509" style="s2">know talk about choices you know first</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.569" end="00:06:37.770" style="s2">of all I have to say what is the basis</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.509" end="00:06:39.509" style="s2">of the choice am I just basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.770" end="00:06:40.950" style="s2">following a rule that is specific to a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.509" end="00:06:42.150" style="s2">particular world</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.950" end="00:06:43.650" style="s2">or have a check to make sure that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.150" end="00:06:45.690" style="s2">rule actually makes sense within a</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.650" end="00:06:48.450" style="s2">greater context of values could give us</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.690" end="00:06:49.830" style="s2">an example well as I mentioned you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.450" end="00:06:51.450" style="s2">on the internet forum there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.830" end="00:06:53.370" style="s2">things which which make a lot of sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.450" end="00:06:55.260" style="s2">as far as good behavior and what what</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.370" end="00:06:57.180" style="s2">actually constitutes communication that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.260" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">fulfills the function of communication</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.180" end="00:07:00.360" style="s2">ie we make sense of our lives we</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:02.310" style="s2">understand choices that we&#39;re making a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.360" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">little better and so on when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.310" end="00:07:05.460" style="s2">talking about ethics what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:07.110" style="s2">basically saying is okay well what are</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.460" end="00:07:10.260" style="s2">the general principles of communication</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.110" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">that apply in every forum so for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.260" end="00:07:13.710" style="s2">if I have a medium of communication</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">where if I just say the word hang up</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.710" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">that it hangs up the phone then all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">sudden I now have a limit as to what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">can actually say in the communication</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:23.790" style="s2">channel because things that are content</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:25.830" style="s2">are now going to affect the context so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.790" end="00:07:28.320" style="s2">in effect we identify that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.830" end="00:07:30.360" style="s2">sort of principle that if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:32.460" style="s2">relationship between content and context</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.360" end="00:07:34.820" style="s2">such that there&#39;s a conditional ization</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.460" end="00:07:37.290" style="s2">on the context based upon the content</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.820" end="00:07:38.700" style="s2">then in effect I limit the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.290" end="00:07:40.830" style="s2">the communication channel to carry</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.700" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">information so in effect there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.830" end="00:07:43.980" style="s2">certain things that happen in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:45.660" style="s2">that basically limit communication and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.980" end="00:07:47.870" style="s2">we find that those are less than</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.660" end="00:07:50.340" style="s2">desirable so we translate that into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.870" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">specific situation so for instance if I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.340" end="00:07:54.120" style="s2">you know in a conversation with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:56.130" style="s2">and I pull out a gun and I shoot them</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.120" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">that ends the conversation I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.130" end="00:07:59.730" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a very fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.800" style="s2">change of state there and so in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.730" end="00:08:02.970" style="s2">of recognizing that you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.800" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">these general principles about</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.970" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">communication itself what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:07.920" style="s2">to have reciprocity what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:09.510" style="s2">have symmetry you know information</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.920" end="00:08:11.750" style="s2">theoretic kinds of ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.510" end="00:08:14.490" style="s2">about it which are very very abstract</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.750" end="00:08:17.340" style="s2">translated into concrete realities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.490" end="00:08:19.170" style="s2">thou shalt not kill as a commandment you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.340" end="00:08:20.880" style="s2">know that there&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.170" end="00:08:23.880" style="s2">these two things and a lot of times as</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.880" end="00:08:25.320" style="s2">the world changes we have to rethink the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.880" end="00:08:27.780" style="s2">relationship between the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.320" end="00:08:29.550" style="s2">the rules so as everybody knows the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:30.990" style="s2">world has gotten much different than it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.550" end="00:08:32.580" style="s2">was say 200 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.990" end="00:08:34.530" style="s2">the introduction of technology and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.580" end="00:08:36.990" style="s2">internet and cars and automobiles planes</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.530" end="00:08:38.610" style="s2">and all that all of this stuff has has</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.990" end="00:08:40.020" style="s2">really drastically changed the world in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:41.610" style="s2">which we live and so in effect what</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.020" end="00:08:44.760" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do now is to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.610" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">how do we understand what are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.760" end="00:08:47.670" style="s2">choices that we need to make what are</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:50.370" style="s2">the principles that we need to apply</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.670" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">this who in effect even understand what</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.370" end="00:08:52.570" style="s2">good set of codes would be in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:54.850" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.570" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">mein of action so in effect it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.850" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">like the conversations that are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:08:59.590" style="s2">basis of policymaking or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.140" style="s2">conversations that are the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.590" end="00:09:03.640" style="s2">judicial process or things like that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.140" end="00:09:05.350" style="s2">know in effect we&#39;re just trying at this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.640" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">point to understand how do we understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.350" end="00:09:10.300" style="s2">the situation well enough so that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:11.620" style="s2">choices about how to implement things at</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.300" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">the level of policy at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.620" end="00:09:17.080" style="s2">rules actually makes sense relative to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:18.640" style="s2">what our underlying values are and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.080" end="00:09:21.790" style="s2">does seem to be the challenge of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.640" end="00:09:25.090" style="s2">time and can we find a firm basis on</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.790" end="00:09:27.940" style="s2">which to craft a set of operating rules</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.090" end="00:09:29.620" style="s2">which I think you call morality for our</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.940" end="00:09:31.990" style="s2">time yes that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.620" end="00:09:34.450" style="s2">so in effect the you asked about why is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.990" end="00:09:36.310" style="s2">the philosophy important well if we if</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.450" end="00:09:39.730" style="s2">we treat the topic of ethics as being</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.310" end="00:09:42.130" style="s2">the principles of effective choice right</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">so so now we can say well immediately</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.130" end="00:09:46.300" style="s2">you know what are those principles but</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">we also have to have some notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.300" end="00:09:49.840" style="s2">do we mean by effective and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:51.460" style="s2">mean by choice one of the great dilemmas</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.840" end="00:09:53.470" style="s2">of the time and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.460" end="00:09:55.000" style="s2">reason why you know metaphysics is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.470" end="00:09:56.470" style="s2">actually kind of important is that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.000" end="00:09:57.690" style="s2">really need coherent thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.470" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">nature of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.690" end="00:10:01.960" style="s2">choice and causation</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:03.460" style="s2">at the moment there&#39;s a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.960" end="00:10:04.660" style="s2">good thinking about causation we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.460" end="00:10:06.730" style="s2">science and technology where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.660" end="00:10:08.470" style="s2">effectively disciplines of how to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:10.390" style="s2">about causation in a really good way</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.470" end="00:10:12.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve learned about reason we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.390" end="00:10:14.110" style="s2">an effective L to clear thinking tools</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.070" end="00:10:15.730" style="s2">in that space but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.110" end="00:10:17.650" style="s2">similarly good tools about thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.730" end="00:10:19.900" style="s2">about what is when we mean by choice in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.650" end="00:10:22.360" style="s2">fact if we take science tech technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.900" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">as at face value they would assert</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.360" end="00:10:25.570" style="s2">something along the lines of maybe there</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:27.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t choice maybe the world is</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.570" end="00:10:29.320" style="s2">deterministic maybe there&#39;s some sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.790" end="00:10:31.720" style="s2">in which the notion of choices and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.320" end="00:10:33.820" style="s2">illusion and without really addressing</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.720" end="00:10:35.080" style="s2">you know what is the fundamental basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.820" end="00:10:37.420" style="s2">of choice how do we understand that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.080" end="00:10:39.460" style="s2">concept than the the concept of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.420" end="00:10:42.040" style="s2">itself doesn&#39;t end up having you know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.460" end="00:10:43.810" style="s2">foundation so one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.040" end="00:10:44.980" style="s2">metaphysics does is it gives us a clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.810" end="00:10:46.930" style="s2">way of thinking about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.980" end="00:10:48.760" style="s2">choice and therefore a clear way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.930" end="00:10:51.190" style="s2">notion of thinking about the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.760" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">effective choice as a subclass of choice</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.190" end="00:10:54.490" style="s2">and then we can start thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">what are the principles of effective</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.490" end="00:10:57.730" style="s2">choice and all of this is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:59.080" style="s2">important because if we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.730" end="00:11:01.570" style="s2">clear sense as to what those principles</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.080" end="00:11:02.740" style="s2">are then there really isn&#39;t any clear</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.570" end="00:11:04.210" style="s2">thinking about the nature of what an</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.740" end="00:11:05.390" style="s2">effective choice actually is in any</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.210" end="00:11:07.610" style="s2">particular context</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.390" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">so you know in effect we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.610" end="00:11:10.220" style="s2">start with these really abstract things</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.990" end="00:11:11.860" style="s2">but ultimately it ends up being about</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.220" end="00:11:15.410" style="s2">pretty practical issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.860" end="00:11:16.820" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s step back to choice soon but</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.410" end="00:11:19.070" style="s2">let me take a little dive into</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.820" end="00:11:21.500" style="s2">metaphysics you know people who listen</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.070" end="00:11:23.180" style="s2">to the show know I&#39;m known to say from</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.500" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">time to time when I hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.180" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">metaphysics I reach for my pistol</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:31.880" style="s2">historically one of those people ago</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.930" end="00:11:33.410" style="s2">metaphysics what am i Jeff Maloney just</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.880" end="00:11:34.130" style="s2">give me a pistol malla gee that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.410" end="00:11:36.950" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.130" end="00:11:39.140" style="s2">however I did read some of your material</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.950" end="00:11:41.660" style="s2">on your metaphysics and it was at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.140" end="00:11:43.220" style="s2">intelligible let me run back when I</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.660" end="00:11:45.950" style="s2">thought I heard you can tell me whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.220" end="00:11:47.420" style="s2">I was hearing it right or not and I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.950" end="00:11:49.520" style="s2">give you my critique on what you had to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.420" end="00:11:53.000" style="s2">say you know my take was that you were</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.520" end="00:11:56.660" style="s2">trying to bridge the gap between realism</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.000" end="00:11:59.330" style="s2">and idealism however my take was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.660" end="00:12:01.700" style="s2">the realism that you put forth was</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.330" end="00:12:03.980" style="s2">essentially a straw man version that</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.700" end="00:12:05.570" style="s2">really isn&#39;t relevant to what realists</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.980" end="00:12:09.170" style="s2">think today and that it seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.570" end="00:12:11.810" style="s2">only about the hardcore physical matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.170" end="00:12:14.330" style="s2">when you know practicing realists now</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.810" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">take into consideration the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.330" end="00:12:18.980" style="s2">all sorts of mentally know things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:20.630" style="s2">Systems Theory Network Theory complexity</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.980" end="00:12:23.030" style="s2">science higher levels of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.630" end="00:12:25.580" style="s2">neuroscience etc they&#39;re all about</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.030" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">change over time the distinction I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.580" end="00:12:30.110" style="s2">called the distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:33.140" style="s2">dancer which is the matter and the dance</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.110" end="00:12:35.390" style="s2">the dynamics and if we consider all</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.140" end="00:12:37.910" style="s2">those to be part of realism do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.390" end="00:12:41.600" style="s2">actually need metaphysics and if we do</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.910" end="00:12:42.890" style="s2">tell me why well actually I actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.600" end="00:12:44.900" style="s2">agree with everything that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.890" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">saying so first of all let&#39;s let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.900" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">clear about what we mean by metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.490" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">cuz I because I think the observation</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:52.250" style="s2">you&#39;re making about hey you know when</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:54.140" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about metaphysics what are</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.250" end="00:12:57.410" style="s2">we actually talking about the whole New</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.140" end="00:12:59.060" style="s2">Age movement has largely made it a you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.410" end="00:13:01.280" style="s2">know a topic that&#39;s not intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.060" end="00:13:02.540" style="s2">coherent so you know the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.280" end="00:13:04.490" style="s2">that says is what are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.540" end="00:13:07.160" style="s2">well metaphysics is the questions of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.490" end="00:13:08.690" style="s2">what is and how do we know it&#39;s more or</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.160" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">less an academic discipline the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.690" end="00:13:13.430" style="s2">thinking about it so I have great</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:14.960" style="s2">appreciation for the sentiment so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.430" end="00:13:17.480" style="s2">effect it&#39;s not so much from my</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.960" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">perspective about bridging the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.480" end="00:13:20.460" style="s2">relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.450" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">realism and idealism so much as actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.460" end="00:13:25.110" style="s2">creating a foundation for both of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:28.110" style="s2">concepts so instead of saying one or the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.110" end="00:13:29.100" style="s2">other of those ways is is true what</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.110" end="00:13:30.330" style="s2">we&#39;re really trying to do is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.100" end="00:13:32.190" style="s2">trying to say how do we support these</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.330" end="00:13:33.710" style="s2">concepts from an even deeper basis so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.190" end="00:13:36.390" style="s2">that this doesn&#39;t end up being a contest</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.710" end="00:13:37.830" style="s2">the other thing is is that I think I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.390" end="00:13:39.720" style="s2">actually agree with the notion that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.830" end="00:13:41.250" style="s2">not just about matter it&#39;s also about</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.720" end="00:13:43.740" style="s2">the interactions and the dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.250" end="00:13:45.630" style="s2">their progression through time and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.740" end="00:13:47.250" style="s2">addition to that I would add actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.630" end="00:13:50.070" style="s2">there&#39;s even a third category so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.250" end="00:13:52.890" style="s2">the sort of stuff in space perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.070" end="00:13:55.170" style="s2">then there&#39;s the forces in time</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.890" end="00:13:57.180" style="s2">perspective and then there is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.170" end="00:13:58.980" style="s2">probabilities and possibilities so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.180" end="00:14:00.300" style="s2">effect what we&#39;re essentially saying is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.980" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">that it&#39;s not just even about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:05.490" style="s2">dynamics but it&#39;s also about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:07.050" style="s2">sequences of possible histories when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.490" end="00:14:08.280" style="s2">look at quantum mechanics for example we</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.050" end="00:14:10.920" style="s2">look at things which have to do with</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.280" end="00:14:13.050" style="s2">alternate situations like if this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.920" end="00:14:14.490" style="s2">particular measurement happens and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.050" end="00:14:17.940" style="s2">state is determined and these other</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.490" end="00:14:19.380" style="s2">states become the possible futures so in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.940" end="00:14:21.060" style="s2">effect there&#39;s a many-worlds</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.380" end="00:14:22.710" style="s2">interpretation and we kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.060" end="00:14:25.140" style="s2">ourselves as basically being in one</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.710" end="00:14:27.660" style="s2">context or in another as dependent upon</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.140" end="00:14:29.160" style="s2">measurement process so in effect we</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.660" end="00:14:30.810" style="s2">could think of measurement processes not</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.160" end="00:14:32.190" style="s2">just being a distinct thing but also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.810" end="00:14:34.470" style="s2">kind of dynamic that is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.190" end="00:14:36.870" style="s2">interrelationship between observable</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.470" end="00:14:39.210" style="s2">objective States and virtual eyes</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.870" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2">potential States as as mediated by say</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.210" end="00:14:43.260" style="s2">you know one of the wave equations so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:45.000" style="s2">think that you know the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.260" end="00:14:47.550" style="s2">dynamic or the notion of realism is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:48.540" style="s2">actually a very strong and very coherent</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.550" end="00:14:50.940" style="s2">point of view and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.540" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">bracketed by these two other frames of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.940" end="00:14:55.410" style="s2">reference the actuality and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">potentiality I think that when when</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.410" end="00:15:00.600" style="s2">people look at realism and idealism in</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:01.860" style="s2">the in the older way you&#39;re right they</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.600" end="00:15:04.500" style="s2">tend to think about it as either being</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.860" end="00:15:06.870" style="s2">deterministic in the sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.500" end="00:15:10.290" style="s2">defined by external phenomena to find my</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.870" end="00:15:12.210" style="s2">matter versus in some sort of subjective</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.290" end="00:15:14.760" style="s2">sense as in you know who&#39;s the observer</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.210" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2">who&#39;s making the measurement what moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.760" end="00:15:18.680" style="s2">in time is the is the selection of which</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:21.090" style="s2">possible worlds were going to end up in</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:22.410" style="s2">so in effect it&#39;s not so much that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.090" end="00:15:25.800" style="s2">ways in which I&#39;m thinking of these are</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.410" end="00:15:27.060" style="s2">our strong man or cricketer so much as</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.800" end="00:15:28.950" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to look at kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.060" end="00:15:30.250" style="s2">is what is the fundamental idealized</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.950" end="00:15:32.860" style="s2">state by which the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.250" end="00:15:36.010" style="s2">and these concepts okay that&#39;s good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.860" end="00:15:38.080" style="s2">I continue to remain a realist but with</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.010" end="00:15:39.550" style="s2">the distinctions that I made that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.080" end="00:15:41.350" style="s2">know there I do believe there is a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.550" end="00:15:43.960" style="s2">world out there there&#39;s only one of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.350" end="00:15:46.180" style="s2">probably not a multiverse at least not</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.960" end="00:15:48.790" style="s2">in the quantum-mechanical of many worlds</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.180" end="00:15:51.070" style="s2">theory in fact I put my flag down on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.790" end="00:15:53.590" style="s2">as if many worlds interpretation which</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.070" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">is do the math as if many worlds but by</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.590" end="00:15:57.250" style="s2">some process we don&#39;t understand only</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:15:59.190" style="s2">one of them becomes real think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.250" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">actually meet on all of this I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.190" end="00:16:03.400" style="s2">know the way you&#39;re describing realism</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.690" end="00:16:04.930" style="s2">to me sounds very coherent I think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.400" end="00:16:06.790" style="s2">only adjustment that I would be making</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.930" end="00:16:10.570" style="s2">is instead of attaching the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.790" end="00:16:12.850" style="s2">real directly to the objective which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.570" end="00:16:15.340" style="s2">what realism would would normally do I</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.850" end="00:16:16.780" style="s2">mean idealism in a complimentary way I</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.340" end="00:16:18.910" style="s2">would say that the notion of real is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.780" end="00:16:20.230" style="s2">attached to the subjective that in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.910" end="00:16:22.840" style="s2">particular orientation we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.230" end="00:16:24.790" style="s2">real is attached to the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.840" end="00:16:26.830" style="s2">between the object even a subjective so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.790" end="00:16:29.950" style="s2">in other words the interaction is real</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.830" end="00:16:31.810" style="s2">and anything we project as being what</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.950" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">that interaction tells us about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.810" end="00:16:34.630" style="s2">objective worlds or what that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.190" end="00:16:36.790" style="s2">interaction tells us about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.630" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">subjective those are things which are</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.790" end="00:16:40.020" style="s2">happy phenomena of the notion of real</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:42.010" style="s2">which lives at the interaction level</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.020" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">yeah though I would also I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.010" end="00:16:46.930" style="s2">also and this is yet to be fully</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:49.240" style="s2">determined but at least my sense most</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.930" end="00:16:51.850" style="s2">likely that we&#39;re going to discover that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.240" end="00:16:53.980" style="s2">the subjective is less spooky than it</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.850" end="00:16:56.110" style="s2">seems and once we fully understand how</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.980" end="00:16:57.520" style="s2">consciousness works for instance we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.110" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">gonna be surprised that we ever got</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.520" end="00:17:02.980" style="s2">ourselves so tangled up and knots you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:05.890" style="s2">know that the subjective is a biological</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.980" end="00:17:07.750" style="s2">process like any other biology of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.890" end="00:17:10.660" style="s2">is compounded of first chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:12.939" style="s2">below that physics and it just is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.660" end="00:17:15.640" style="s2">it is and it&#39;s an emergent phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.939" end="00:17:18.069" style="s2">from the way matter and the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.640" end="00:17:20.890" style="s2">matter are ordered and particularly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.069" end="00:17:23.140" style="s2">it animals is essentially an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.890" end="00:17:26.290" style="s2">dynamic process at the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.140" end="00:17:28.150" style="s2">between perception on one side memory on</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.290" end="00:17:31.390" style="s2">the other memory can be both genetic</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.150" end="00:17:33.250" style="s2">memory and lifetime memory and some form</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.390" end="00:17:35.080" style="s2">of processing in between and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.250" end="00:17:37.000" style="s2">probably no more than that so that which</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.080" end="00:17:39.070" style="s2">case the whole idea of a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.000" end="00:17:40.929" style="s2">just goes away it just is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.070" end="00:17:42.220" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot of subtle things</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.929" end="00:17:43.539" style="s2">associated that we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.220" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">kind of fire field from thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.539" end="00:17:46.900" style="s2">choice and you know how to do governance</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.179" style="s2">and things like that if we go down this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.900" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">particular road I mean I personally am</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.179" end="00:17:53.260" style="s2">NOT a favor of the many worlds theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.720" style="s2">myself I tend to be more on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.260" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">Copenhagen interpretation side but when</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:00.280" style="s2">we get to the the whole notion of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:02.140" style="s2">know can we derive a first-person</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.280" end="00:18:06.100" style="s2">perspective from a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.140" end="00:18:08.350" style="s2">mechanical world or can we think about a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.100" end="00:18:10.539" style="s2">choice purely in terms of causation can</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.350" end="00:18:12.840" style="s2">we can we actually model consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.539" end="00:18:14.860" style="s2">in terms of compute you know based upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:16.450" style="s2">you know again a lot of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.860" end="00:18:17.950" style="s2">this kind of thing I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.450" end="00:18:20.380" style="s2">the notion of computing consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.950" end="00:18:21.970" style="s2">are distinct and that in effect we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.380" end="00:18:23.350" style="s2">really have a coherent notion of</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.970" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">consciousness because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.350" end="00:18:28.179" style="s2">think about it in terms of compute but</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:30.070" style="s2">that&#39;s a you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.179" end="00:18:31.690" style="s2">you know can of worms and we could spend</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.070" end="00:18:33.429" style="s2">you know obviously days talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.690" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">this sort of thing I guess the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.429" end="00:18:37.419" style="s2">is that if we&#39;re if we&#39;re looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.860" end="00:18:40.630" style="s2">know what are the principles of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.419" end="00:18:42.100" style="s2">and how to ethics translate into you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.630" end="00:18:44.169" style="s2">know choices about the world and so on</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.100" end="00:18:45.730" style="s2">and so forth we can either you know try</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.169" end="00:18:47.500" style="s2">to reconcile the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.730" end="00:18:50.350" style="s2">choice and causation at a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.500" end="00:18:51.940" style="s2">level or we can do pretty much what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.350" end="00:18:53.830" style="s2">Western legal systems have done which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.940" end="00:18:55.539" style="s2">assume that there is consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.830" end="00:18:57.490" style="s2">assume there is choice assume there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.539" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">subjective and that the subjective has</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.490" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">some sort of notion of choice and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:03.549" style="s2">try to figure out what your as prudence</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">looks like after that so you know again</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.549" end="00:19:06.909" style="s2">it depends upon what conversation you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.890" style="s2">want to have yeah you know I do like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.909" end="00:19:10.750" style="s2">dive into these foundations a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.890" end="00:19:12.850" style="s2">then we&#39;ll pop up to a more applied</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.750" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">level but again when I hear</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.850" end="00:19:18.130" style="s2">conversations about things like free</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:20.260" style="s2">will or determinism versus random</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.130" end="00:19:23.980" style="s2">strikes me that that all misses the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.260" end="00:19:27.159" style="s2">point that what we have is a specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.980" end="00:19:29.500" style="s2">mechanism let&#39;s call it a human body</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.159" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">with a brain in it a series of</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.500" end="00:19:34.330" style="s2">resonances between the neurons and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">body and the stomach and the perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.330" end="00:19:39.429" style="s2">from the census et cetera and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:43.059" style="s2">comes in and then affordances are</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.429" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">triggered and that&#39;s it I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.059" end="00:19:47.080" style="s2">to say what is their free will just</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:49.059" style="s2">seems to me a question that has no</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.080" end="00:19:51.490" style="s2">meaning we know that we do trigger</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.059" end="00:19:54.309" style="s2">affordances ie we do things in response</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.490" end="00:19:55.700" style="s2">to our genetic and lifetime memories and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.309" end="00:19:57.529" style="s2">in response to our</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.700" end="00:20:00.230" style="s2">options but is there anything actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.529" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">useful in trying to call that free will</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.230" end="00:20:05.090" style="s2">well I don&#39;t tend to use the notion free</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:07.429" style="s2">will I mean the notion of free and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.090" end="00:20:08.990" style="s2">notion of we&#39;ll both have certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.429" end="00:20:10.370" style="s2">complications associated with them I</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.990" end="00:20:13.010" style="s2">mean I use the word choice fairly</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.370" end="00:20:14.870" style="s2">specifically ie there&#39;s a range of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.010" end="00:20:16.730" style="s2">potentials as some sort of selection and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.870" end="00:20:18.260" style="s2">then there&#39;s a consequence in the way I</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.730" end="00:20:20.269" style="s2">think about things there&#39;s no such thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.260" end="00:20:23.240" style="s2">as absolutely free without having some</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.269" end="00:20:25.010" style="s2">at least maybe multiple limitations and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.240" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s no notion of limitation it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.010" end="00:20:28.820" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have some degree of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.240" end="00:20:30.440" style="s2">associated with it and these are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.820" end="00:20:32.899" style="s2">know implied in the in the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.440" end="00:20:35.570" style="s2">the relationships so in a sense when</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.899" end="00:20:37.700" style="s2">we&#39;re getting into you know can we model</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.570" end="00:20:39.860" style="s2">the whole thing just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.700" end="00:20:41.240" style="s2">molecular biology or can we model the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.860" end="00:20:43.309" style="s2">whole thing in terms of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.240" end="00:20:44.750" style="s2">determinism I&#39;ve looked at those</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:46.220" style="s2">questions pretty closely and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.750" end="00:20:48.380" style="s2">think that really the answer is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.220" end="00:20:50.450" style="s2">know you know in effect when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.380" end="00:20:52.549" style="s2">look at like reductionism as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.450" end="00:20:53.960" style="s2">fundamental principle you know to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.549" end="00:20:56.510" style="s2">basically say that everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.960" end="00:20:58.669" style="s2">knowable about chemistry could in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.510" end="00:21:00.610" style="s2">principle be defined purely in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.669" end="00:21:03.889" style="s2">our understanding of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.610" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">or you know take the general standard</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.889" end="00:21:07.730" style="s2">model and and and try to see if that in</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.860" style="s2">combination with quantum mechanic can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.730" end="00:21:12.620" style="s2">used as a basis to derive everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.860" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">that is knowable about chemistry well as</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.620" end="00:21:16.580" style="s2">some people have observed who have deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:19.279" style="s2">knowledge of both topics it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.580" end="00:21:20.990" style="s2">there&#39;s phenomena in chemistry that just</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.279" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">in principle can&#39;t be explained on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:24.590" style="s2">basis of the standard model</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:26.450" style="s2">so in effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.590" end="00:21:29.630" style="s2">kinds of emergent phenomena that we just</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.450" end="00:21:31.970" style="s2">don&#39;t have the capacity to essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.630" end="00:21:34.639" style="s2">derive in any kind of first principled</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.970" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">way based upon the the notions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.639" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">causation on the quote prior domain of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.980" end="00:21:40.760" style="s2">physics and this is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:42.830" style="s2">surprising so because the thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.760" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">said if we look at the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.830" end="00:21:47.269" style="s2">reductionism as a philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:49.130" style="s2">principle and we take you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.269" end="00:21:53.000" style="s2">the place what is the the exemplar of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.130" end="00:21:54.139" style="s2">the strongest likely relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.000" end="00:21:56.870" style="s2">we would be able to see a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.139" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">between physics and chemistry as being</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.870" end="00:22:01.880" style="s2">the quintessential exemplars a hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:03.289" style="s2">science reductionist perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.880" end="00:22:04.920" style="s2">turns out that not even in that case</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.289" end="00:22:06.660" style="s2">does it work so there</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.920" end="00:22:08.580" style="s2">for the notion of reductionism itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.660" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">has to be called into question yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.580" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">that&#39;s very true and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.980" style="s2">one of the core foundations of</p>

<p begin="00:22:59.640" end="00:23:04.020" style="s2">this the interesting thing about what</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.100" end="00:23:06.390" style="s2">you just described I call it microstate</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.940" end="00:23:17.910" style="s2">is knowable about the microstate of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.620" end="00:23:19.380" style="s2">domain will ultimately there&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.380" end="00:23:23.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a place that we can see that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.480" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">there are actual limits as to what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.970" end="00:23:29.400" style="s2">possible to know at all even in</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.400" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">these things and we say okay well there</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.900" end="00:23:35.520" style="s2">is a notion of other then what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.350" end="00:23:37.650" style="s2">knowable there&#39;s essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.520" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">fundamentally not just known and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.650" end="00:23:41.730" style="s2">unknown but there&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.150" end="00:23:44.070" style="s2">unknowable so then when we go thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.730" end="00:23:45.630" style="s2">about the nature of choice and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.070" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s now a basis</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.630" end="00:23:49.680" style="s2">for us to say okay well there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:51.450" style="s2">more than just the feedback of the of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.680" end="00:23:54.510" style="s2">the you know physical system that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.450" end="00:23:57.540" style="s2">looking at there&#39;s also this something</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.510" end="00:23:59.160" style="s2">else and you know we could again skip</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.540" end="00:24:00.390" style="s2">over a whole lot of intermediate levels</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.160" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">but at certain point we can say</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.390" end="00:24:05.220" style="s2">something like utilitarian ethics that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:07.530" style="s2">based purely upon feedback mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.220" end="00:24:08.730" style="s2">and you know objective metric and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.530" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">criteria and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.730" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">optimization problems to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:14.940" style="s2">isn&#39;t the whole story that there needs</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:17.740" style="s2">to be some notion of a value ethics a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.940" end="00:24:19.150" style="s2">kind of way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.740" end="00:24:20.800" style="s2">you know what do we really care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.150" end="00:24:22.200" style="s2">what really matters here what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.800" end="00:24:25.030" style="s2">the kind of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.200" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">fundamentally our basis of choice that</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.030" end="00:24:30.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come from some sort of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:31.300" style="s2">mechanism that&#39;s let&#39;s go there but</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.070" end="00:24:34.570" style="s2">before we do it I want to do one last</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.300" end="00:24:35.740" style="s2">digression into foundations and this was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.570" end="00:24:37.179" style="s2">something I did not know you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.740" end="00:24:38.860" style="s2">interested in until I started doing my</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.179" end="00:24:41.559" style="s2">research a couple days ago and I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.860" end="00:24:43.750" style="s2">very interested by the little tiny</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.559" end="00:24:46.420" style="s2">one-page paper you wrote called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.750" end="00:24:48.850" style="s2">epistemic sandwich cuz there&#39;s nary I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.420" end="00:24:50.470" style="s2">very interested in his time and I am</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.850" end="00:24:52.870" style="s2">generally aligned with the group of</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.470" end="00:24:55.750" style="s2">people like hunger and small and who</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.870" end="00:24:57.460" style="s2">believe time is real and that the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.750" end="00:24:58.990" style="s2">may be more real in space</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.460" end="00:25:01.000" style="s2">and you&#39;ve made a pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.990" end="00:25:03.250" style="s2">argument I wouldn&#39;t say it was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.000" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">lead-pipe cinch but it seemed a good way</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.250" end="00:25:08.830" style="s2">to get to a non entropic arrow of time</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:10.030" style="s2">at least the the range of space in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.830" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">we live I thought that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.030" end="00:25:14.140" style="s2">interesting great well I&#39;m glad that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:15.970" style="s2">had an interest in that I tend to find</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.140" end="00:25:18.460" style="s2">myself in a fairly interesting position</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.970" end="00:25:20.020" style="s2">so on one hand I can definitely count</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.460" end="00:25:22.420" style="s2">myself in the camp of saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.020" end="00:25:25.480" style="s2">time is in a certain sense more</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.420" end="00:25:28.210" style="s2">fundamental than space and more</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.480" end="00:25:30.280" style="s2">fundamental than possibility so in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.210" end="00:25:32.500" style="s2">effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s this by</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.280" end="00:25:34.030" style="s2">symmetric relationship that effectively</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.500" end="00:25:37.179" style="s2">comes out of that but that that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.030" end="00:25:38.650" style="s2">one way to think about it it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.179" end="00:25:40.270" style="s2">that there is this thing called the Inca</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.650" end="00:25:42.280" style="s2">mensuration theorem which basically says</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.270" end="00:25:43.750" style="s2">there&#39;s a completely complementary</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.280" end="00:25:46.059" style="s2">perspective of how to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.750" end="00:25:48.100" style="s2">which is the perspective that modern</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.059" end="00:25:52.050" style="s2">physics largely seems to be taking which</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.100" end="00:25:54.309" style="s2">is that we have this third person</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.050" end="00:25:56.290" style="s2">orientation to sort of what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.309" end="00:25:58.929" style="s2">treating as a kind of classical realist</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.290" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">perspective as a you know time is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.929" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">illusion that effectively we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:04.840" style="s2">about the complete world state of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:06.520" style="s2">universe and so in effect there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.840" end="00:26:10.090" style="s2">really deep into relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.520" end="00:26:11.920" style="s2">the symmetry and the discontinuity that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.090" end="00:26:13.510" style="s2">we see in the foundations of quantum</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.920" end="00:26:15.850" style="s2">mechanics and general relativity and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.510" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">sort of physicalist realist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.850" end="00:26:20.650" style="s2">and this you know as a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:22.870" style="s2">perspective ultimately and then this</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.650" end="00:26:25.570" style="s2">first-person perspective which treats</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.870" end="00:26:26.650" style="s2">the asymmetry of time is fundamental and</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.570" end="00:26:28.840" style="s2">the notion of the continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.650" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">consciousness is fundamental and then in</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.840" end="00:26:32.370" style="s2">effect we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">be in one way of thinking about it or in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.370" end="00:26:37.370" style="s2">the other way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:39.350" style="s2">that those two in effect are mutually</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.370" end="00:26:42.330" style="s2">mutually a Fagin always of</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.350" end="00:26:44.730" style="s2">conceptualizing the universe and so in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.330" end="00:26:47.220" style="s2">effect the whole reason that metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.730" end="00:26:49.320" style="s2">is of interest is because it&#39;s the basis</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.220" end="00:26:51.330" style="s2">by which we can derive this principle of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.320" end="00:26:53.990" style="s2">this Fagin allottee between those two</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.330" end="00:26:56.520" style="s2">perspectives in a sense becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.990" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">ordinated basis by which the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.520" end="00:26:59.940" style="s2">themselves are really understood and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:01.560" style="s2">that makes it actually pretty profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.940" end="00:27:02.910" style="s2">important you have to dig a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.560" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">further in that because I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.910" end="00:27:07.980" style="s2">I you know I tend to align myself more</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.700" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">with the arrow of time is real more in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.980" end="00:27:11.700" style="s2">the least small and model and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:13.920" style="s2">folks there is an episode of on the show</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.700" end="00:27:15.690" style="s2">from Lee small we go into these in some</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.920" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">considerable detail have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.690" end="00:27:19.320" style="s2">relook and see at your argument on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:21.150" style="s2">orthogonality and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.320" end="00:27:22.830" style="s2">essentially dual ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.150" end="00:27:24.510" style="s2">world which would be quite interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.830" end="00:27:27.000" style="s2">think we&#39;ve probably spent as much time</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.510" end="00:27:29.250" style="s2">on these kinds of foundational questions</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.000" end="00:27:31.380" style="s2">as it makes sense to do let&#39;s switch to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.250" end="00:27:33.330" style="s2">value ethics it&#39;s certainly highly</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.380" end="00:27:35.490" style="s2">important when we think about operating</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.330" end="00:27:38.550" style="s2">in the real world ok what do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.490" end="00:27:42.360" style="s2">know tell me what your theory is a value</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.550" end="00:27:43.800" style="s2">ethics well there&#39;s a couple of specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.360" end="00:27:46.050" style="s2">things so first of all is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.800" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">when we think about values its it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.050" end="00:27:49.590" style="s2">important to contextualize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:51.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of other concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.590" end="00:27:53.550" style="s2">people sort of tie in with this and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.060" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">again coming from a sort of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.550" end="00:27:58.530" style="s2">perspective I tend to think in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:00.410" style="s2">meaningfulness and purposefulness so in</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.530" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">other words the notions of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.410" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">values and purposes have this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:07.980" style="s2">distinctness that those three concepts</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:09.570" style="s2">are distinct they&#39;re not interchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.980" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">obviously they don&#39;t mean the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.570" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">and and by one we don&#39;t we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.300" style="s2">want to substitute the other and a lot a</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:17.370" style="s2">lot of people do this you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.300" end="00:28:19.350" style="s2">accidentally they they&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.370" end="00:28:22.140" style="s2">values in the way that they would think</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.350" end="00:28:23.820" style="s2">about purposes and unfortunately that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.140" end="00:28:26.340" style="s2">that ends up creating a lot of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.820" end="00:28:28.020" style="s2">because the way in which meaning works</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.340" end="00:28:30.270" style="s2">the way in which values work in the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.020" end="00:28:32.730" style="s2">in which purposes work are actually very</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.270" end="00:28:36.360" style="s2">different they are they are truly kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.730" end="00:28:38.880" style="s2">of different modalities of how to think</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.360" end="00:28:40.770" style="s2">about relationships in life and so on</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.880" end="00:28:42.420" style="s2">why don&#39;t we start with that I may I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.770" end="00:28:43.710" style="s2">will say that there&#39;s been a lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.420" end="00:28:45.539" style="s2">lately about meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.710" end="00:28:48.059" style="s2">fullness and a lot of us left me</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.539" end="00:28:49.740" style="s2">scratching my head so I would love it if</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.059" end="00:28:51.960" style="s2">you could go through those three and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:53.250" style="s2">provide your take on what they are and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.960" end="00:28:55.710" style="s2">how they&#39;re distinct from each other</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.250" end="00:28:58.230" style="s2">great so let&#39;s take a very object</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.710" end="00:28:59.669" style="s2">example so I have a toaster okay and as</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.230" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned the purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.669" end="00:29:03.690" style="s2">toaster is to cook toast I put put some</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:05.399" style="s2">bread in and I push the button and a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.690" end="00:29:09.539" style="s2">minutes later I get some some breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.399" end="00:29:11.399" style="s2">so as far as the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.539" end="00:29:15.240" style="s2">myself and the toaster is concerned if</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.399" end="00:29:16.860" style="s2">we if we consider the toaster and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.240" end="00:29:18.899" style="s2">purpose of the toaster is defined by</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:21.419" style="s2">something external to the toaster in</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.899" end="00:29:23.880" style="s2">other words I am NOT the toaster the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.419" end="00:29:25.860" style="s2">toaster has a purpose assigned to it by</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.880" end="00:29:29.039" style="s2">something other than the object of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.860" end="00:29:30.270" style="s2">toaster when we talk about values we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.039" end="00:29:32.010" style="s2">actually talking about something which</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.270" end="00:29:34.500" style="s2">is you know completely different like so</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.010" end="00:29:36.210" style="s2">if I you know have children and and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.500" end="00:29:39.330" style="s2">I think about you know maybe I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.210" end="00:29:42.390" style="s2">farmer in some medieval context and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.330" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">might say you know my son is to replace</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.390" end="00:29:46.470" style="s2">me and is to essentially assist with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:48.750" style="s2">farm and so on and so forth well that</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.470" end="00:29:50.279" style="s2">but the son might have his own desires</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.750" end="00:29:52.710" style="s2">as to what he wants to do with life and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.279" end="00:29:54.600" style="s2">and the value of the son isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.710" end="00:29:56.279" style="s2">necessarily good to be find just in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.600" end="00:29:58.740" style="s2">terms of the functions that he&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">to perform for the family he may decide</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.740" end="00:30:03.330" style="s2">that he has wants to go to school or</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">does something else and of course these</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.330" end="00:30:07.860" style="s2">are somewhat modern interpretations but</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:09.090" style="s2">the idea here is is that when we think</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.860" end="00:30:11.010" style="s2">about the value of something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.090" end="00:30:13.380" style="s2">thinking about it as being innate in</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.010" end="00:30:15.299" style="s2">other words not something imposed from</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.380" end="00:30:17.610" style="s2">the outside as from the father to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.299" end="00:30:19.620" style="s2">son but something that occurs from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.610" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">inside ie inside internal to the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.620" end="00:30:24.090" style="s2">itself and you know the person you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:26.580" style="s2">when we when we talk about values we</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.090" end="00:30:28.500" style="s2">talk about them as coming from inside of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.580" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">ourselves and manifesting in the choices</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.500" end="00:30:33.480" style="s2">that we make in in into the world so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of origin of expression</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.480" end="00:30:38.549" style="s2">versus target of expression kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.610" end="00:30:40.200" style="s2">aspect of thinking about it so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.549" end="00:30:41.990" style="s2">if we if we want to look at what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.200" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">notion of meaningfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.990" end="00:30:46.770" style="s2">meaningfulness in the sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.899" style="s2">whether or not the word dog means a</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.770" end="00:30:52.380" style="s2">furry creature that has legs and barks</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.899" end="00:30:53.909" style="s2">the sound in the air dog and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.380" end="00:30:55.970" style="s2">particular associations that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.909" end="00:30:57.030" style="s2">subjectively make internal and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.970" end="00:30:58.710" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.030" end="00:30:59.850" style="s2">reference that it has to a free creature</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.710" end="00:31:02.130" style="s2">that happens to be in the room sitting</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.850" end="00:31:04.680" style="s2">next to me you know those associations</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.130" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">are not held purely in an external way</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.680" end="00:31:09.090" style="s2">nor purely in an internal way they</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.540" end="00:31:10.680" style="s2">happen to occur in the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.090" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">between the subjective and the object of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.680" end="00:31:15.870" style="s2">their inherently transpersonal so in</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:18.900" style="s2">effect if we were to sort of sum up we</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.870" end="00:31:20.940" style="s2">would say that purposes are defined in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.900" end="00:31:24.450" style="s2">such a way is that they come from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.940" end="00:31:27.000" style="s2">outside values are defined in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.450" end="00:31:29.100" style="s2">that they come from the inside and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.000" end="00:31:30.780" style="s2">meaning is essentially something that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.100" end="00:31:34.290" style="s2">between and in the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.780" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">the inside and the outside okay now of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.290" end="00:31:37.500" style="s2">course sociologists will tell us that at</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:39.630" style="s2">least from a human perspective our</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.500" end="00:31:41.880" style="s2">values don&#39;t really come from inside us</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.630" end="00:31:44.700" style="s2">they are actually very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.880" end="00:31:48.450" style="s2">creatures of our community our family</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.700" end="00:31:49.890" style="s2">our teachers our religions etc well I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.450" end="00:31:51.540" style="s2">would think that this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.890" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">actually a classical case of you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.540" end="00:31:55.490" style="s2">the sociology doesn&#39;t isn&#39;t really as</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:57.330" style="s2">interested in trying to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.490" end="00:31:59.340" style="s2">definitions of these things that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.330" end="00:32:01.560" style="s2">be metaphysically coherent in the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.340" end="00:32:03.810" style="s2">that I&#39;m using it so in effect it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.560" end="00:32:06.050" style="s2">of like we actually want both we want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.810" end="00:32:08.460" style="s2">have the clarity of the terminology and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.050" end="00:32:11.370" style="s2">the real results of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.460" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">anthropology sociology psychology really</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.370" end="00:32:16.470" style="s2">integrated well and I think that to some</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.270" style="s2">extent the things that the sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.470" end="00:32:20.280" style="s2">are pointing to has as much to do with</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.270" end="00:32:21.960" style="s2">meaningfulness you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.280" end="00:32:23.250" style="s2">meaningfulness of relationships in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.960" end="00:32:25.620" style="s2">community the communications that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.250" end="00:32:27.000" style="s2">occurring and so on so forth as much as</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.620" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">they&#39;re referring about values so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.000" end="00:32:30.420" style="s2">obviously when we talk about values</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:32.280" style="s2">purpose and meaning these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.420" end="00:32:35.760" style="s2">although they may be distinct concepts</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.280" end="00:32:38.010" style="s2">they are not inseparable that wherever</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:41.100" style="s2">any one of these concepts occurs the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.010" end="00:32:43.320" style="s2">other two will for sure occur whether</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.100" end="00:32:45.570" style="s2">we&#39;re conscious of that or not and so a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.320" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">lot of times because of the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.570" end="00:32:50.580" style="s2">this co-occurrence people tend to alight</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">the differences between them and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.580" end="00:32:53.280" style="s2">that may or may not be important</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:55.710" style="s2">depending upon what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.280" end="00:32:58.980" style="s2">if we&#39;re thinking about ethics and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.710" end="00:33:00.570" style="s2">really trying to have a kind of rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.980" end="00:33:02.430" style="s2">way of thinking about this to really be</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.570" end="00:33:04.260" style="s2">clear when we&#39;re making choices that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.430" end="00:33:05.880" style="s2">are profoundly impactful if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.260" end="00:33:07.920" style="s2">thinking about existential risk or for</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.880" end="00:33:10.150" style="s2">thinking about civilization</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.920" end="00:33:12.190" style="s2">you know possibility of collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.150" end="00:33:15.280" style="s2">and you know economic forces that are of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.190" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">huge magnitude you know whether to set</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.280" end="00:33:19.240" style="s2">policies that may go to war or whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:20.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real importance that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.240" end="00:33:22.330" style="s2">we think about the ethics from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.620" end="00:33:25.450" style="s2">principle point of view with with deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.330" end="00:33:27.370" style="s2">deep deep clarity in effect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.450" end="00:33:29.740" style="s2">there&#39;s some real necessities around</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.370" end="00:33:31.480" style="s2">this so for instance if we you know look</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.740" end="00:33:34.180" style="s2">at the relationship between man machine</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.480" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">and nature and and we realize that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.180" end="00:33:37.570" style="s2">know in the technology that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:39.550" style="s2">developed that we have created</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:47.320" style="s2">know things of that nature that in</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.370" end="00:33:49.210" style="s2">effect we we now find ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.320" end="00:33:51.130" style="s2">position of really needing to make very</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.210" end="00:33:53.500" style="s2">very good principled choices and so as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.130" end="00:33:55.930" style="s2">result the clarity and the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.500" end="00:33:57.880" style="s2">the ethics that we&#39;re using has to be of</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.930" end="00:33:59.800" style="s2">just absolutely paramount quality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.880" end="00:34:01.570" style="s2">like you know if we have the power of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.800" end="00:34:03.220" style="s2">gods we effectively need to have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.570" end="00:34:05.800" style="s2">kind of ethical coherency that a God</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.220" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">would have you know not to really take</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.800" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">this into religion but just to really</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:10.899" style="s2">give an indication of just how important</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:12.850" style="s2">it is to be profoundly clear about some</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.899" end="00:34:14.409" style="s2">of these concepts that&#39;s perfect why</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.850" end="00:34:18.280" style="s2">don&#39;t we try then to integrate a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.409" end="00:34:19.990" style="s2">specific example that gets to or applies</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.280" end="00:34:22.690" style="s2">ethics in the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.990" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">meaningfulness values and purpose let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:28.120" style="s2">take a real example so I&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:31.300" style="s2">decision on whether to do some</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.120" end="00:34:33.340" style="s2">experiment with CRISPR for instance well</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.300" end="00:34:34.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.340" end="00:34:36.429" style="s2">directions we can go of this so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.840" end="00:34:38.470" style="s2">might be familiar with the work of Dave</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.429" end="00:34:40.390" style="s2">Snowden we talked about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.470" end="00:34:41.980" style="s2">between complicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.390" end="00:34:43.810" style="s2">ie the kinds of things that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.980" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">with computation and simulation and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.810" end="00:34:49.450" style="s2">on and complex which is situations that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">are more like nature where there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.450" end="00:34:52.540" style="s2">of lots of factors interacting and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:55.419" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know the complete state</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.540" end="00:34:58.150" style="s2">of the system at any given moment so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.419" end="00:35:01.660" style="s2">know in one sense we can say okay how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.150" end="00:35:04.330" style="s2">we make choices in the space of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.660" end="00:35:05.830" style="s2">complex given that the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.330" end="00:35:06.880" style="s2">we really can&#39;t control the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.830" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">happening in the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.880" end="00:35:11.770" style="s2">complicated and it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:14.470" style="s2">relationship between these two realms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.770" end="00:35:15.850" style="s2">operation is actually it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.470" end="00:35:17.050" style="s2">important to really understand that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.850" end="00:35:18.730" style="s2">because there&#39;s some things that for</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.050" end="00:35:21.100" style="s2">example we can&#39;t predict with any amount</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.730" end="00:35:23.260" style="s2">of accuracy so when we&#39;re making choices</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.100" end="00:35:24.050" style="s2">in this particular space we&#39;re refining</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.260" end="00:35:26.390" style="s2">that we really</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.050" end="00:35:28.190" style="s2">need to account for whether or not we</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.390" end="00:35:30.650" style="s2">can do a safe to fail probe ie</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.190" end="00:35:32.210" style="s2">can we interact with the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.650" end="00:35:34.940" style="s2">world to gather some information about</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.210" end="00:35:37.580" style="s2">it use that information in some way to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.940" end="00:35:39.170" style="s2">at least do a proxy of some sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.580" end="00:35:41.390" style="s2">know vague simulation so we have at</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.170" end="00:35:43.370" style="s2">least some indication as to what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.390" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">outcomes might be but but in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.370" end="00:35:47.000" style="s2">situation we&#39;re still having to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:49.430" style="s2">some notion of value what outcomes do we</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.000" end="00:35:52.040" style="s2">consider to be successful what are we</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.430" end="00:35:54.500" style="s2">actually looking to have happen and is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.040" end="00:35:56.630" style="s2">that you know the desires of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.500" end="00:35:59.480" style="s2">wanting to have happen on what basis are</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:36:02.540" style="s2">those things clarified so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.480" end="00:36:04.130" style="s2">we&#39;re if we&#39;re looking at okay can we do</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.540" end="00:36:07.100" style="s2">a safe to fill probe in a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.130" end="00:36:08.630" style="s2">CRISPR well already it may be the case</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.100" end="00:36:11.180" style="s2">that we can&#39;t - like for instance we</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.630" end="00:36:13.670" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily want to experiment you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.180" end="00:36:17.000" style="s2">know on biological systems because if</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.670" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">the thing has its replicating capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.000" end="00:36:19.730" style="s2">then it might be that once we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:21.320" style="s2">the experiment we&#39;ll never actually ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.730" end="00:36:23.420" style="s2">get to do another experiment again</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.320" end="00:36:25.030" style="s2">because we&#39;ve destroyed the system in</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.420" end="00:36:28.250" style="s2">which we were performing the experiment</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.030" end="00:36:30.680" style="s2">so in that case we see already can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.250" end="00:36:34.550" style="s2">safe to fail probes if the probe itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.680" end="00:36:36.560" style="s2">is too consequential so obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.550" end="00:36:38.540" style="s2">don&#39;t test you know whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:40.520" style="s2">know global nuclear war is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.540" end="00:36:42.110" style="s2">going to create you know nuclear winter</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.520" end="00:36:44.330" style="s2">because that would obviously be bad you</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.110" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to do that experiment more</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.330" end="00:36:49.400" style="s2">than one time so in effect there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion here of first of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.400" end="00:36:54.110" style="s2">what do we care about well just getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">the data from the from the safe to fill</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.110" end="00:36:58.700" style="s2">probe is is really only a proxy for our</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">capacity to predict the future and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.700" end="00:37:03.290" style="s2">capacity to predict the future is itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:06.080" style="s2">relative to some sort of value statement</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.290" end="00:37:07.970" style="s2">so you know the purposes of our safe to</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.080" end="00:37:10.340" style="s2">fail probes are effectively connected to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.970" end="00:37:12.350" style="s2">the meaningfulness of our values so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.340" end="00:37:13.880" style="s2">there&#39;s another level here which is you</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.350" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">know also kind of kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.880" end="00:37:20.150" style="s2">important is that when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.730" end="00:37:21.680" style="s2">you know can we actually do experiments</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.150" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">of this particular kind somewhere along</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.680" end="00:37:26.720" style="s2">the way we realized that we really just</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:28.850" style="s2">can&#39;t always know what the impacts are</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.720" end="00:37:30.860" style="s2">going to be even in principle and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.850" end="00:37:32.150" style="s2">therefore we have to think about can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.860" end="00:37:35.000" style="s2">get clear as to whether we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.150" end="00:37:37.340" style="s2">right simulation at all are we even</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.000" end="00:37:37.770" style="s2">asking the right questions so for</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.340" end="00:37:39.210" style="s2">instance of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.770" end="00:37:41.640" style="s2">I do a whole bunch of simulations about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.210" end="00:37:42.570" style="s2">factor X but it turns out that the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.640" end="00:37:45.390" style="s2">that I&#39;m really looking for is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.570" end="00:37:47.280" style="s2">solution to problem Y then to some</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.390" end="00:37:49.830" style="s2">extent you know I&#39;m investing lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.280" end="00:37:51.180" style="s2">lots of energy into the wrong problem so</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.830" end="00:37:52.950" style="s2">so in a lot of ways what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.180" end="00:37:55.260" style="s2">trying to do here is essentially to ask</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.950" end="00:37:57.450" style="s2">better questions can we get to the place</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.260" end="00:38:00.150" style="s2">where we&#39;re even you know looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.450" end="00:38:01.320" style="s2">CRISPR and things like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.150" end="00:38:03.630" style="s2">when we&#39;re thinking about it from an</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.320" end="00:38:05.790" style="s2">ethical point of view it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.630" end="00:38:08.430" style="s2">do we actually know what the criteria of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.790" end="00:38:10.860" style="s2">success is do we do we have a real sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.430" end="00:38:12.120" style="s2">as to what is the whole system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.860" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">approach that&#39;s actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.120" end="00:38:16.110" style="s2">satisficing to a whole range of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:17.400" style="s2">criterias rather than just the one or</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.110" end="00:38:19.860" style="s2">two that we happen to be conscious of at</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.400" end="00:38:20.850" style="s2">this moment so it&#39;s those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.860" end="00:38:22.230" style="s2">things which would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.850" end="00:38:23.400" style="s2">directions in which we would go with</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.230" end="00:38:24.510" style="s2">something like this and there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:25.940" style="s2">are others but those are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.510" end="00:38:28.050" style="s2">occur to me just off the top my head</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.940" end="00:38:29.370" style="s2">yeah when I was talking with Dave</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.050" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">Snowden here on the show one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.370" end="00:38:32.700" style="s2">things I pointed out to him and he</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.720" end="00:38:35.070" style="s2">agreed is that one of things you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:37.530" style="s2">keep in mind is that every complicated</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.070" end="00:38:40.470" style="s2">system is inevitably embedded in at</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.530" end="00:38:43.950" style="s2">least one complex system and that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.470" end="00:38:45.360" style="s2">is a flow between the two they take for</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.950" end="00:38:47.580" style="s2">instance a business a business is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.360" end="00:38:49.170" style="s2">basically a complicated system and yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.580" end="00:38:52.290" style="s2">it interacts with a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.170" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">called the marketplace right and a farm</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.290" end="00:38:56.940" style="s2">is a relatively complicated system</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:59.460" style="s2">though it has some complexity to it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.940" end="00:39:01.290" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly complicated and yet a farm</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.460" end="00:39:04.200" style="s2">is embedded in an ecosystem which is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.290" end="00:39:06.060" style="s2">classic complex system and so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.200" end="00:39:08.070" style="s2">understand the the couplings between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.060" end="00:39:10.470" style="s2">complicated and the complex I has to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.070" end="00:39:12.480" style="s2">always be done in the context that every</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.470" end="00:39:14.370" style="s2">complicated system is embedded in at</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.480" end="00:39:16.590" style="s2">least one complex system yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.370" end="00:39:19.950" style="s2">completely agree the the main thing is</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.590" end="00:39:21.840" style="s2">to understand that between the complex</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.950" end="00:39:25.500" style="s2">and the complicated that the complex is</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.840" end="00:39:28.110" style="s2">stronger is is actually in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.500" end="00:39:29.670" style="s2">sense the foundational basis and so on</p>

<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:35.820" style="s2">for example that in effect the values</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.080" end="00:39:39.060" style="s2">have to be stronger than the purposes</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.820" end="00:39:41.490" style="s2">that the values provide the basis for</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.690" end="00:40:04.010" style="s2">I am saying that if you take the values</p>

<p begin="00:40:34.280" end="00:40:37.340" style="s2">that I think that just came up with an</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.570" end="00:40:39.320" style="s2">interesting idea that maybe will</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.340" end="00:40:41.330" style="s2">illuminate this for me and hopefully for</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.320" end="00:40:42.980" style="s2">the audience I mentioned farming</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.330" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">something I&#39;m involved with I&#39;m a farmer</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.980" end="00:40:48.620" style="s2">my wife and I support local agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:50.630" style="s2">businesses etc as well and farming is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.620" end="00:40:53.000" style="s2">sort of complicated it has some complex</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.630" end="00:40:55.130" style="s2">elements but it&#39;s mostly complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.000" end="00:40:58.280" style="s2">yet it&#39;s embedded in the ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.130" end="00:41:00.650" style="s2">we make decisions as civilization on way</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.280" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">bigger scale than me on what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.650" end="00:41:05.930" style="s2">farming that we do and that has huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:08.750" style="s2">implications through its coupling from</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.930" end="00:41:10.090" style="s2">the complicated to the complex and there</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.750" end="00:41:13.640" style="s2">would least be my argument that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.090" end="00:41:16.130" style="s2">industrial farming is doing such damage</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.640" end="00:41:18.290" style="s2">to the outer complex ecosystem that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.130" end="00:41:20.450" style="s2">not sustainable at all even at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.290" end="00:41:23.240" style="s2">current level let alone at the level</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.450" end="00:41:25.820" style="s2">which it has to be to provide a Western</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.240" end="00:41:27.800" style="s2">level of standard of living for eight</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.820" end="00:41:30.230" style="s2">billion people so how would your</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.800" end="00:41:32.690" style="s2">analysis try to think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.230" end="00:41:35.060" style="s2">should mean for how we do agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.690" end="00:41:36.320" style="s2">well first of all I just want to you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.060" end="00:41:37.550" style="s2">know state for the record that I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.320" end="00:41:38.990" style="s2">complete agreement with your point of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.550" end="00:41:40.760" style="s2">view that we really really do need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.990" end="00:41:42.290" style="s2">move to a sustainable way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.760" end="00:41:43.880" style="s2">things or else you know that which does</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.290" end="00:41:47.450" style="s2">not sustain life will not continue to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.880" end="00:41:49.100" style="s2">live so you know how do we apply you</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.450" end="00:41:50.780" style="s2">know ethics in this particular case well</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.100" end="00:41:52.310" style="s2">it&#39;s not just about the ethics it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.780" end="00:41:53.750" style="s2">about you know what are our values and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.310" end="00:41:56.930" style="s2">our values in this particular sense say</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.750" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">well we want to be sustainable we want</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.930" end="00:42:00.650" style="s2">be adaptive right so for instance not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:02.270" style="s2">just sustainable because if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.650" end="00:42:04.010" style="s2">just implement sustainable it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.270" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">like you know how do we keep a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.010" end="00:42:08.450" style="s2">complicated system going no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:10.069" style="s2">happens in the complex world ie we build</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.450" end="00:42:12.290" style="s2">some sort of thing that quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.069" end="00:42:15.140" style="s2">lasts forever but as as we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.290" end="00:42:16.670" style="s2">mentioned given that the complex is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.140" end="00:42:19.220" style="s2">basis for the complicated that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.670" end="00:42:22.790" style="s2">ultimately that doesn&#39;t work so we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.220" end="00:42:26.270" style="s2">the capacity for the complex systems to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.790" end="00:42:29.660" style="s2">both be sustainable and to be adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.270" end="00:42:31.970" style="s2">ie to evolve to basically work well with</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.660" end="00:42:34.700" style="s2">the context in which they exist so for</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.970" end="00:42:37.819" style="s2">instance as the natural world changes we</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.700" end="00:42:39.109" style="s2">want to adapt our farming practices so</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.819" end="00:42:41.809" style="s2">that they continue to be sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.109" end="00:42:43.190" style="s2">over the long term and in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.809" end="00:42:45.650" style="s2">that we have to bring in this third</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.190" end="00:42:46.579" style="s2">element which is in the you know I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.650" end="00:42:48.230" style="s2">you&#39;re probably gonna hate that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.579" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">going to use this word but but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.230" end="00:42:54.109" style="s2">certain consciousness involved ie that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:56.300" style="s2">we&#39;re not just evolving in a blind sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.109" end="00:43:00.050" style="s2">the same way that say evolution would do</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.300" end="00:43:01.880" style="s2">because although evolution if you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.050" end="00:43:04.069" style="s2">about the scientific method for example</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.880" end="00:43:06.200" style="s2">which is you know to perform experiments</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.069" end="00:43:08.839" style="s2">and to you know kind of dispassionately</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.200" end="00:43:10.760" style="s2">recent review the results and then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.839" end="00:43:13.579" style="s2">know based upon the results to perform</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.760" end="00:43:15.950" style="s2">new experiments that nature implementing</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.579" end="00:43:17.500" style="s2">the evolutionary model is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.950" end="00:43:20.359" style="s2">the perfect scientist it tries</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.500" end="00:43:23.049" style="s2">everything and it is completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.359" end="00:43:27.140" style="s2">different absolutely about the results</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.049" end="00:43:28.910" style="s2">so in fact what happens is is that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.140" end="00:43:31.250" style="s2">know from our perspective some of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.910" end="00:43:32.809" style="s2">experiments obviously fail you know we</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.250" end="00:43:34.849" style="s2">could end up with entire species dying</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.809" end="00:43:37.250" style="s2">off we could entire you know continents</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.849" end="00:43:39.260" style="s2">basically becoming deserts so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.250" end="00:43:41.150" style="s2">we&#39;re wanting to say okay if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.260" end="00:43:44.089" style="s2">to actually do thriving if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.150" end="00:43:45.799" style="s2">to want to move it beyond just what can</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.089" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">be done through a pure feedback based</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.799" end="00:43:50.150" style="s2">methodology we&#39;re going to have to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">a kind of consciousness that transcends</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.150" end="00:43:55.069" style="s2">just evolutionary process we&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:43:57.319" style="s2">forced ourselves as a as a species into</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.069" end="00:43:58.940" style="s2">this particular position because of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.319" end="00:44:01.130" style="s2">use of technology technology has</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.940" end="00:44:02.990" style="s2">essentially enabled a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.130" end="00:44:05.319" style="s2">top-down sort of way of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.990" end="00:44:08.690" style="s2">currently it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.319" end="00:44:10.609" style="s2">we&#39;re driving the top-down method as if</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.690" end="00:44:13.249" style="s2">it was based upon the kind</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.609" end="00:44:14.569" style="s2">of unconsciousness of the of the market</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.249" end="00:44:17.150" style="s2">system the unconsciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.569" end="00:44:19.190" style="s2">evolutionary process and we expect that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.150" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">that actually is going to to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.190" end="00:44:23.779" style="s2">outcome it&#39;s effectively a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:25.460" style="s2">unconsciousness the market evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.779" end="00:44:26.869" style="s2">unconscious in the fundamental way and</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.460" end="00:44:29.450" style="s2">so as a result we end up with the worst</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.869" end="00:44:31.160" style="s2">of both possible worlds you know pure</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.450" end="00:44:33.499" style="s2">evolution working by itself for pure</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.160" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">technology working by itself so in</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.499" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">effect what we&#39;re needing to do is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:39.920" style="s2">needing to introduce a kind of values</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.130" end="00:44:41.180" style="s2">based meaningfulness based way of</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.920" end="00:44:43.730" style="s2">thinking about these things which</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.180" end="00:44:46.249" style="s2">effectively means that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.730" end="00:44:48.109" style="s2">clear about what is our basis of choice</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.249" end="00:44:49.519" style="s2">how are we thinking about choice in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.109" end="00:44:51.980" style="s2">way that is holistic that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.519" end="00:44:54.920" style="s2">account for both evolutionary aspects</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.980" end="00:44:56.299" style="s2">and sustainability aspects and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.920" end="00:44:58.670" style="s2">reconcile the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.299" end="00:45:00.950" style="s2">sustainability and evolution in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.670" end="00:45:02.809" style="s2">conscious way which ie is you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.950" end="00:45:05.299" style="s2">connected to the notions of our values</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.809" end="00:45:07.509" style="s2">of thriving the values of life the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.299" end="00:45:09.799" style="s2">values of why we even thought that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.509" end="00:45:12.019" style="s2">adaptability and sustainability were</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.799" end="00:45:14.210" style="s2">important in the first place yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.019" end="00:45:16.130" style="s2">absolutely well said and by no means do</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.210" end="00:45:18.410" style="s2">I disagree with you I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.130" end="00:45:21.289" style="s2">evolutionary approach worked great for</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.410" end="00:45:22.759" style="s2">billions of years in biology and kind of</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.489" end="00:45:36.499" style="s2">the game changed entirely the scope of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.220" end="00:45:38.210" style="s2">what humans could do started to go up</p>

<p begin="00:45:50.569" end="00:45:54.259" style="s2">to 1750 there was really nothing humans</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.109" style="s2">could do to seriously damage the</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">said we have the power of gods we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.980" end="00:46:11.299" style="s2">to have the wisdom of gods and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.200" end="00:46:13.579" style="s2">not like the greco-roman gods who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.299" end="00:46:15.769" style="s2">pretty damn capricious right you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.579" end="00:46:17.809" style="s2">remember the Iliad all the wacky</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.769" end="00:46:19.069" style="s2">the gods did there right we got to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.809" end="00:46:22.099" style="s2">better gods than those</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.069" end="00:46:24.410" style="s2">and and we have to you know think we now</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.099" end="00:46:26.239" style="s2">are in charge and we so damn well have</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.410" end="00:46:29.209" style="s2">the responsibility to figure out how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.239" end="00:46:31.729" style="s2">can use this unbelievable power we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.209" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">responsibly to not track the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.729" end="00:46:36.349" style="s2">yeah that sounds that sounds right to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.029" style="s2">I mean I think that again you know in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.349" end="00:46:40.699" style="s2">proportion to the degree that there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.029" end="00:46:43.849" style="s2">an asymmetry of power that we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.699" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">asymmetry of strength and so in effect</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.849" end="00:46:46.339" style="s2">there&#39;s our continuity of strength</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:48.440" style="s2">actually might be an even better way to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.339" end="00:46:51.949" style="s2">state this is that you know our wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.440" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">our capacity to really you know feel</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.949" end="00:46:55.459" style="s2">through and think through these these</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">kinds of issues and to do both really</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.459" end="00:46:59.569" style="s2">really well you know again to make good</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:01.160" style="s2">choices in this space isn&#39;t just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.569" end="00:47:03.289" style="s2">be dependent upon intellect it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.160" end="00:47:05.089" style="s2">going to be dependent upon the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.289" end="00:47:07.699" style="s2">quality of feeling through the issues</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.089" end="00:47:09.829" style="s2">and I don&#39;t see those as any sense in</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.699" end="00:47:11.900" style="s2">opposition to one another this goes back</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.829" end="00:47:14.420" style="s2">to part of the reason why it was so</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.900" end="00:47:15.799" style="s2">important to distinguish between values</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.420" end="00:47:18.380" style="s2">meaning and purpose in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.799" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">is that when we think about values we</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.380" end="00:47:22.519" style="s2">can have all values values are not</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:24.829" style="s2">defined in any kind of mutually</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.519" end="00:47:27.229" style="s2">exclusive way whereas when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.829" end="00:47:28.699" style="s2">purposes purposes are mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.229" end="00:47:31.430" style="s2">you know you can basically do one thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.699" end="00:47:33.829" style="s2">at a time and so in a sense there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.430" end="00:47:36.829" style="s2">there&#39;s a real need for us to to have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.829" end="00:47:40.699" style="s2">good holding of both the the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.829" end="00:47:42.739" style="s2">which we move from values into purpose</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.699" end="00:47:44.390" style="s2">which is essentially as gated by this</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.739" end="00:47:46.369" style="s2">notion of meaningfulness in other words</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.390" end="00:47:48.380" style="s2">that there&#39;s a kind of flow that a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.369" end="00:47:50.839" style="s2">multiplicity of values that having a lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.380" end="00:47:52.430" style="s2">of values allows us to identify</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.839" end="00:47:55.579" style="s2">something which is really meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.430" end="00:47:56.989" style="s2">when we have a clear sense of many</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.579" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">things that are meaningful then we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.989" end="00:48:01.489" style="s2">begin to start to think about you know a</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:04.430" style="s2">single purpose and so in effect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.489" end="00:48:06.739" style="s2">a there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.430" end="00:48:08.839" style="s2">progression here that is that is really</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.739" end="00:48:11.209" style="s2">important for us to to implement because</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.839" end="00:48:13.880" style="s2">if we don&#39;t as you mentioned you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.209" end="00:48:16.969" style="s2">the the sort of emotionality of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.880" end="00:48:18.680" style="s2">the early depictions of Greek gods as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.969" end="00:48:20.660" style="s2">example and and the kind of pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.680" end="00:48:23.509" style="s2">family dynamics that they had as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.660" end="00:48:24.979" style="s2">exemplar was not wisdom in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.509" end="00:48:28.579" style="s2">that we would mean in fact if you look</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.979" end="00:48:31.250" style="s2">at most of the religious idealization of</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.579" end="00:48:33.700" style="s2">deity forms they actually have</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.250" end="00:48:35.980" style="s2">would be if I were to apply the dsm-5</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.700" end="00:48:38.630" style="s2">tremendous pathologies narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.980" end="00:48:41.570" style="s2">magical thinking all sorts of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.630" end="00:48:44.020" style="s2">which effectively would show up on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.570" end="00:48:47.660" style="s2">dark triad of personality disorders and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.020" end="00:48:50.510" style="s2">so in effect what you end up with is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.660" end="00:48:53.840" style="s2">sort of need to have a much much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.510" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">much much more coherent notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.840" end="00:48:57.830" style="s2">it means to make good choices that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:01.220" style="s2">based upon something that is is even</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.830" end="00:49:03.260" style="s2">deeper than just you know I want and in</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.220" end="00:49:04.700" style="s2">some unique sense but in a sense of we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.260" end="00:49:07.670" style="s2">want and some sort of collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.700" end="00:49:11.390" style="s2">and to have that be you know genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.670" end="00:49:13.640" style="s2">to have a genuine capacity for that so</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.390" end="00:49:15.080" style="s2">this this is where we get from you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.640" end="00:49:16.970" style="s2">the notions of these things as thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.080" end="00:49:19.760" style="s2">about an individual sense you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.970" end="00:49:21.320" style="s2">United States thinking in terms of life</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.760" end="00:49:23.660" style="s2">liberty presume happiness was just a</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.660" end="00:49:28.360" style="s2">collectively you know make choices about</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.880" end="00:49:31.070" style="s2">things like industrialized farming or</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.360" end="00:49:32.390" style="s2">you know resource usage and whether or</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.070" end="00:49:34.270" style="s2">not it makes sense to allocate resources</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.390" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">in this direction or in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.270" end="00:49:38.600" style="s2">whether or not finance is defined purely</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:40.180" style="s2">in terms of market forces has actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.600" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">got the level of intelligence necessary</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:46.730" style="s2">know side effects that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.210" end="00:49:48.290" style="s2">occurring so in effect you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.730" end="00:49:49.970" style="s2">a there&#39;s a need for us to come down to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.290" end="00:49:51.830" style="s2">a much much deeper level of principle to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.970" end="00:49:53.570" style="s2">handle the scope of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.830" end="00:49:56.660" style="s2">we as a species are now currently faced</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.570" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">with yeah we have some giant challenges</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.660" end="00:50:00.200" style="s2">to go from where we are where most</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:02.030" style="s2">people are blind to these things to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.200" end="00:50:04.250" style="s2">where we need to be I mean first we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.030" end="00:50:06.020" style="s2">some form of sense making right that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.250" end="00:50:08.330" style="s2">people even figure out what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.020" end="00:50:09.890" style="s2">realistically then we need to you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.330" end="00:50:11.600" style="s2">make some choices and then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.890" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">execute some actions you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.600" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2">your thoughts on you know how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:17.930" style="s2">from where we are today we&#39;re complete</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:19.940" style="s2">muddle blind deaf and dumb to sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.930" end="00:50:21.740" style="s2">making choice making an action taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.940" end="00:50:23.540" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s actually the right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:25.640" style="s2">question and so you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.540" end="00:50:27.530" style="s2">things that I heard when I was you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.640" end="00:50:29.480" style="s2">first learning how to be CEO and so on</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.530" end="00:50:31.670" style="s2">is when you don&#39;t know what to do look</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.480" end="00:50:33.410" style="s2">see and tell the truth so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.670" end="00:50:35.230" style="s2">the first pieces is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.410" end="00:50:38.450" style="s2">actually enter into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.230" end="00:50:40.190" style="s2">observational state and then to you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.450" end="00:50:41.660" style="s2">very dispassionately I mean because</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:43.970" style="s2">again you know for if we&#39;re looking to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:44.930" style="s2">try to respond effectively there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.970" end="00:50:46.730" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.930" end="00:50:48.290" style="s2">degree of we&#39;re not going to filter the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.730" end="00:50:51.110" style="s2">information like if you look at delay</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.290" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">emergency responders you know first</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.110" end="00:50:55.880" style="s2">responders show up in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:57.560" style="s2">they&#39;re just saying I see X and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.880" end="00:50:59.090" style="s2">just broadcast that to the other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.560" end="00:51:00.710" style="s2">that are in the group and and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.090" end="00:51:03.080" style="s2">in the sense is sharing information in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.710" end="00:51:07.240" style="s2">pretty much unfiltered way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.080" end="00:51:10.220" style="s2">really trying to create a ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.240" end="00:51:13.010" style="s2">just resources informational resources</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.220" end="00:51:14.840" style="s2">and and from that to basically begin to</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.010" end="00:51:17.420" style="s2">have some sense as to what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.840" end="00:51:20.240" style="s2">and and so in effect what we&#39;re looking</p>

<p begin="00:51:35.420" end="00:51:39.890" style="s2">that is important is for us to recognize</p>

<p begin="00:51:59.690" end="00:52:04.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep need</p>

<p begin="00:52:12.440" end="00:52:17.840" style="s2">to to very much have a sort of real</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.140" end="00:52:19.610" style="s2">inquiry happen as kind of the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.840" end="00:52:21.950" style="s2">of the sense-making process are we</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.320" end="00:52:30.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know before we even get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.540" end="00:52:33.380" style="s2">the point of doing choice making where</p>

<p begin="00:52:34.670" end="00:52:39.020" style="s2">actually our current position and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.190" end="00:52:42.320" style="s2">we&#39;re asking questions as to you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.020" end="00:52:44.180" style="s2">what is our compass in order to really</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.320" end="00:52:46.280" style="s2">guide choices in an effective way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.180" end="00:52:48.500" style="s2">almost as if we need a you know three</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.280" end="00:52:50.320" style="s2">things we need a we need a map we need a</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.789" end="00:53:16.200" style="s2">if I have the compass and a compass is</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.829" end="00:53:18.059" style="s2">saying you know you want to go in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.200" end="00:53:19.980" style="s2">direction you know I&#39;m looking for True</p>

<p begin="00:54:04.950" end="00:54:09.750" style="s2">get there that makes sense relative to</p>

<p begin="00:54:11.869" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">capacity is you know again what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.339" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">trying to do is to show what is</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.819" end="00:55:03.210" style="s2">take a look at an individual neuron and</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.210" end="00:55:07.950" style="s2">neuron the same way that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.490" end="00:55:09.809" style="s2">currently treat you know life liberty</p>

<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:36.490" style="s2">and so on that we took the perspective</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:23.500" style="s2">and relevant to you know how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.369" end="00:57:26.380" style="s2">good sense making as a prelude to doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.500" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">good choice making itself as a prelude</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.380" end="00:57:31.930" style="s2">to say non corruptible non capturable</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:33.880" style="s2">implementation process any thoughts I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.930" end="00:57:35.650" style="s2">mean it looks like a shitshow from where</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.880" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">I sit out in the world you know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.650" end="00:57:40.119" style="s2">anything our social sense making has</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:43.210" style="s2">gotten worse by the introduction of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.119" end="00:57:44.500" style="s2">Internet well it has and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.210" end="00:57:46.119" style="s2">part of the thing is it&#39;s that you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.500" end="00:57:47.500" style="s2">when people introduce technologies like</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.119" end="00:57:49.660" style="s2">the internet and so on so forth they</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.500" end="00:57:51.369" style="s2">have you know a sense of the potential</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.660" end="00:57:52.900" style="s2">of it and you know for every way which</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.369" end="00:57:54.940" style="s2">something is good there are two ways in</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.900" end="00:57:56.500" style="s2">which it could be bad and even</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.940" end="00:57:58.269" style="s2">ironically for every way which something</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.500" end="00:58:00.519" style="s2">is bad there are two ways in which is to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.269" end="00:58:02.980" style="s2">be good and so I think that you know as</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.519" end="00:58:05.019" style="s2">technologists you know we have and again</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.980" end="00:58:07.240" style="s2">you know I&#39;m speaking as someone who has</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.019" end="00:58:08.920" style="s2">you know industrial capacity and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.240" end="00:58:11.049" style="s2">started a company I&#39;ve got resources and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.920" end="00:58:13.269" style="s2">tools you know I can build stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.049" end="00:58:14.440" style="s2">also as a long-term software engineer</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.269" end="00:58:15.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve got work</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.440" end="00:58:17.259" style="s2">deployed at the Pentagon I&#39;ve got work</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.970" end="00:58:19.809" style="s2">deployed at various three-letter</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.259" end="00:58:22.180" style="s2">agencies and such and so you know in</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.809" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">effect there&#39;s a there&#39;s a real deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.180" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">sense as to our capacity as engineers</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:30.069" style="s2">but as engineers we need to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:32.500" style="s2">the the stereotype of the you know sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.069" end="00:58:34.599" style="s2">of Asperger&#39;s perspective of the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.500" end="00:58:36.490" style="s2">and really get adept at thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.599" end="00:58:37.390" style="s2">the sociological aspects the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.490" end="00:58:40.509" style="s2">anthropological and psychological</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.390" end="00:58:41.650" style="s2">aspects and so in effect when we&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.509" end="00:58:43.660" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the internet for</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.650" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">example we need to again from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.660" end="00:58:47.980" style="s2">principle basis not necessarily from a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:50.619" style="s2">market perspective but from a principle</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.980" end="00:58:53.650" style="s2">basis to say you know we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.619" end="00:58:55.150" style="s2">change the orientation of how this this</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.650" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">actually works how we&#39;re actually using</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.150" end="00:58:59.140" style="s2">social media technology how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:59:01.930" style="s2">actually thinking about a social media</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.140" end="00:59:03.460" style="s2">technology as it currently stands is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.930" end="00:59:05.349" style="s2">very much deployed just purely in</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.460" end="00:59:08.259" style="s2">service to corporate interests to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.349" end="00:59:10.029" style="s2">shareholder benefit and you know is</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.259" end="00:59:13.150" style="s2">basically neglectful of community</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.029" end="00:59:14.559" style="s2">benefit of user benefit so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.150" end="00:59:16.450" style="s2">things that has been a real interest to</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.559" end="00:59:18.309" style="s2">me is the work of the Center for Humane</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.450" end="00:59:22.269" style="s2">technology which has really been</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.309" end="00:59:24.250" style="s2">promoting a reo of social technology as</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.269" end="00:59:27.460" style="s2">basically being in service to community</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.250" end="00:59:28.900" style="s2">as its primary objective rather than</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.460" end="00:59:30.730" style="s2">being of service to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.900" end="00:59:31.610" style="s2">surveillance capitalism or attention</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.730" end="00:59:34.010" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.610" end="00:59:37.060" style="s2">and I think that without you know really</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.010" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">making some good inroads to recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.060" end="00:59:42.620" style="s2">broadcasters I as broadcasters moving</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:44.360" style="s2">you know some some you know policy and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.620" end="00:59:46.610" style="s2">legal phenomenon into place which which</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.360" end="00:59:47.810" style="s2">has to do with the ethics of that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.610" end="00:59:48.950" style="s2">know creating moral codes that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.810" end="00:59:51.500" style="s2">effectively say you know you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.950" end="00:59:52.910" style="s2">be you would be responsible in your</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.500" end="00:59:54.470" style="s2">relationship to the community and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.910" end="00:59:57.170" style="s2">that is effectively a service and a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.470" end="00:59:59.360" style="s2">devotion that is fundamental to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.170" end="01:00:00.920" style="s2">institution rather than you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.360" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">maximizing shareholder value on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.920" end="01:00:04.460" style="s2">quarterly scale because obviously if</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.970" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to think about sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.460" end="01:00:10.310" style="s2">over evolutionary time scales you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.970" end="01:00:11.900" style="s2">again in terms of farming practices and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.310" end="01:00:13.490" style="s2">adapting the nature and so on because</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.900" end="01:00:16.100" style="s2">you know that is the reality in which we</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.490" end="01:00:17.360" style="s2">live then in effect we&#39;re going to need</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.100" end="01:00:20.390" style="s2">to be thinking on a much much longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.360" end="01:00:23.030" style="s2">interval than say market Ecology&#39;s can</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.390" end="01:00:24.890" style="s2">actually do because they are too much</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.030" end="01:00:26.630" style="s2">and and compulsively driven on a</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.890" end="01:00:29.000" style="s2">short-term perspective the multipolar</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.630" end="01:00:31.130" style="s2">trap rules for rulers dynamic and all</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.000" end="01:00:32.930" style="s2">that kind of stuff very much you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.130" end="01:00:35.300" style="s2">essentially means that we really need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.930" end="01:00:36.530" style="s2">go to a completely much much more</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.300" end="01:00:39.140" style="s2">comprehensive way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.530" end="01:00:41.480" style="s2">these things and it starts from you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.140" end="01:00:42.710" style="s2">again an individual perspective of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.480" end="01:00:44.300" style="s2">know while i can operate on my own</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.710" end="01:00:45.830" style="s2">benefits some of the time i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.300" end="01:00:48.320" style="s2">operate on my own benefit all of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.830" end="01:00:50.270" style="s2">time which is sort of the supposition</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.320" end="01:00:52.670" style="s2">that most people have in regards to you</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.270" end="01:00:53.750" style="s2">know what they say and do and and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.670" end="01:00:55.220" style="s2">more over than that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.750" end="01:00:58.280" style="s2">collectively we need to get much much</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.220" end="01:01:00.680" style="s2">better at at holding responsibilities in</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.280" end="01:01:02.450" style="s2">association with authority so you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.680" end="01:01:05.180" style="s2">when when a technology company has the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.450" end="01:01:07.340" style="s2">authority to define a platform you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.180" end="01:01:09.980" style="s2">we say hey either be responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.340" end="01:01:11.690" style="s2">that platform you know i actually do the</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.980" end="01:01:12.890" style="s2">things that are that are necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.690" end="01:01:14.690" style="s2">preserve the well-being of the community</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.890" end="01:01:16.910" style="s2">on that platform and so you know i can</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.690" end="01:01:18.320" style="s2">point to things like facebook and say</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.910" end="01:01:21.260" style="s2">you know you do actually need to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.320" end="01:01:23.380" style="s2">responsible for the impact of you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.260" end="01:01:25.640" style="s2">whether or not you have politicians</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.380" end="01:01:28.520" style="s2">basically spreading this information and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.640" end="01:01:30.020" style="s2">disabling the information ecology and</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.520" end="01:01:31.760" style="s2">you know to some extent we can really</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.020" end="01:01:33.410" style="s2">ask the question of it is it even the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.760" end="01:01:35.660" style="s2">case that a representative model of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.410" end="01:01:37.100" style="s2">governance is actually the right one do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.660" end="01:01:39.170" style="s2">we need some sort of sense making that</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.100" end="01:01:40.310" style="s2">is effectively broader than that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.170" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">know some sort of direct democracy</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.310" end="01:01:45.019" style="s2">process but but in you know again in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:46.309" style="s2">larger context we&#39;re realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.019" end="01:01:48.619" style="s2">you know at an individual level we</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.309" end="01:01:51.140" style="s2">definitely need to move beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.619" end="01:01:53.059" style="s2">notion that communication is purely for</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.140" end="01:01:55.909" style="s2">our own individual life liberty and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.059" end="01:01:58.279" style="s2">pursuit of happiness to our kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.909" end="01:01:59.689" style="s2">collective life liberty the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.279" end="01:02:01.789" style="s2">happiness because those two things are</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.689" end="01:02:05.329" style="s2">not separate from one another they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.789" end="01:02:07.459" style="s2">deeply entangled into it in effect we at</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.329" end="01:02:09.109" style="s2">this particular point have a very naive</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.459" end="01:02:10.880" style="s2">understanding of the nature of choice</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.109" end="01:02:13.579" style="s2">and value and ethics and all this kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.880" end="01:02:16.130" style="s2">of stuff so getting educated getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.579" end="01:02:18.289" style="s2">clear as to you know what really matters</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.130" end="01:02:20.390" style="s2">talking to one another about how these</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.289" end="01:02:22.969" style="s2">things actually work I think is</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.390" end="01:02:24.829" style="s2">absolutely essential yep I agree the</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.619" end="01:02:34.099" style="s2">it is interesting I&#39;ve been involved in</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.630" end="01:02:36.769" style="s2">building what we would now call the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.099" end="01:02:38.689" style="s2">internet since 1980 I built some of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.769" end="01:02:41.479" style="s2">earliest things that we would now call</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.689" end="01:02:44.199" style="s2">social media and at the time we had no</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.479" end="01:02:46.519" style="s2">idea of the potential negative</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.649" end="01:03:02.209" style="s2">anybody&#39;s voice be heard</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.999" end="01:03:04.069" style="s2">etc how naive we turned out to be and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.209" end="01:03:05.989" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.069" end="01:03:08.119" style="s2">we all know Facebook&#39;s at shitshow</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.989" end="01:03:09.769" style="s2">Twitter&#39;s worse but here&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.119" end="01:03:12.649" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of interesting there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.769" end="01:03:14.689" style="s2">of us now who know this but nobody that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.649" end="01:03:17.509" style="s2">I know of has built a decent</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.689" end="01:03:20.389" style="s2">sense-making platform for the hundred</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.509" end="01:03:21.919" style="s2">thousand or million woke people awake</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.389" end="01:03:23.689" style="s2">people on the one who use the word woke</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.919" end="01:03:26.599" style="s2">get me confused to those idiots but</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.689" end="01:03:29.539" style="s2">awake people about these issues for us</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.599" end="01:03:32.059" style="s2">to start to rally together I wonder why</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.539" end="01:03:33.799" style="s2">that is well I don&#39;t necessarily know</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.059" end="01:03:35.630" style="s2">why that is I&#39;m not gonna speculate</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.799" end="01:03:37.630" style="s2">about that I mean you mentioned naivete</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.630" end="01:03:40.130" style="s2">earlier and to some extent there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.630" end="01:03:42.439" style="s2">need for us to have you know again both</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.130" end="01:03:44.059" style="s2">technological experience but also social</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.439" end="01:03:46.519" style="s2">logical and anthropological experience</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.059" end="01:03:48.229" style="s2">and in addition to that a deep sense of</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.519" end="01:03:51.380" style="s2">understanding of ethics and metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.229" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">under it and so in a sense I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.380" end="01:03:56.059" style="s2">well okay we have as a species been</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:57.559" style="s2">largely unconscious but you you do</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.059" end="01:03:57.890" style="s2">actually point to essentially the real</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.559" end="01:04:00.320" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.890" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">rather than trying to diagnose why</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.320" end="01:04:05.240" style="s2">hasn&#39;t this happened you know I can</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:07.310" style="s2">definitely do some extensive diagnosis</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.240" end="01:04:09.940" style="s2">as to you know what got us here won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.310" end="01:04:12.500" style="s2">get it there what is really the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.940" end="01:04:13.550" style="s2">basis of the the nature of the problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.500" end="01:04:15.530" style="s2">that have come into the world and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.550" end="01:04:18.590" style="s2">and so forth but the point of such</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.530" end="01:04:20.510" style="s2">analysis isn&#39;t so much to lay blame so</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.590" end="01:04:22.700" style="s2">much as it is to provide litmus tests</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.510" end="01:04:24.830" style="s2">for the success of a solution that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.700" end="01:04:27.530" style="s2">might propose so in other words you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.830" end="01:04:28.880" style="s2">if we were to think about okay well how</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.530" end="01:04:31.340" style="s2">are we going to create a platform that</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.880" end="01:04:32.900" style="s2">effectively is going to be the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.340" end="01:04:35.480" style="s2">good sense making a good choice making</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.900" end="01:04:36.620" style="s2">at a species level you know what are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.480" end="01:04:39.020" style="s2">characteristic that it&#39;s going to look</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.620" end="01:04:40.820" style="s2">like well ultimately immediately we</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.020" end="01:04:42.110" style="s2">already start asking questions and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.820" end="01:04:44.240" style="s2">questions as part of the sense making</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.110" end="01:04:46.280" style="s2">we&#39;re doing with respect to the platform</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.240" end="01:04:48.620" style="s2">itself as well as the thing that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.280" end="01:04:50.030" style="s2">platform actually does and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.620" end="01:04:52.940" style="s2">questions effectively just immediately</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.030" end="01:04:54.770" style="s2">becomes it&#39;s not a platform you know why</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.940" end="01:04:58.040" style="s2">should we have a platform rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.770" end="01:04:59.780" style="s2">protocol because if I if I create it as</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.040" end="01:05:01.340" style="s2">a platform then effectively I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.780" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">created the kind of dynamics of capture</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.340" end="01:05:06.470" style="s2">ability in the and the sort of market</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:08.450" style="s2">forces themselves centralization that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.470" end="01:05:10.550" style="s2">already identified as having been</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.450" end="01:05:13.370" style="s2">somewhat disabling to the kind of choice</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.550" end="01:05:15.080" style="s2">making processes we need to do which to</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.370" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">some extent really need to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.080" end="01:05:18.590" style="s2">distributed you know there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:20.390" style="s2">recognition that ultimately there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.590" end="01:05:22.040" style="s2">so much information that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.390" end="01:05:24.260" style="s2">processed in order to make a good choice</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.040" end="01:05:25.670" style="s2">that is just simply not the case that</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.260" end="01:05:26.840" style="s2">any amount that centralization is</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.670" end="01:05:28.750" style="s2">effectively going to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.840" end="01:05:30.950" style="s2">the bandwidth that is required for</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.750" end="01:05:32.600" style="s2">example you know if I if I look at</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.950" end="01:05:35.150" style="s2">institutional design and it&#39;s based upon</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.600" end="01:05:36.740" style="s2">some sort of top-down model then just</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.150" end="01:05:37.790" style="s2">from information theoretic constraints I</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.740" end="01:05:40.490" style="s2">know that there&#39;s certain problems that</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.790" end="01:05:44.720" style="s2">it can&#39;t solve things that for example</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.490" end="01:05:46.610" style="s2">are so complex so complicated that no</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.720" end="01:05:48.260" style="s2">single human being in their entire</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.610" end="01:05:49.700" style="s2">lifetime could learn all that they would</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.260" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">need to do to make good choices in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.700" end="01:05:53.930" style="s2">space you know that even if we were to</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:55.790" style="s2">have you know that person surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.930" end="01:05:59.030" style="s2">a team of advisors or we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.790" end="01:06:00.740" style="s2">team of say 12 people that were trying</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.030" end="01:06:02.810" style="s2">to make choices with respect to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.740" end="01:06:04.310" style="s2">hundred thousand people it can</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.810" end="01:06:06.710" style="s2">immediately be observed is there any</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.310" end="01:06:08.420" style="s2">possible way that a person can have the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.710" end="01:06:09.830" style="s2">wisdom of a hundred thousand or that a</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.420" end="01:06:11.420" style="s2">person can have the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.830" end="01:06:13.309" style="s2">billion of people that their choice</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.420" end="01:06:15.500" style="s2">is actually influenced well even if we</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.309" end="01:06:17.990" style="s2">look at you know small subgroups we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.500" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">ask the same question can any possible</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.990" end="01:06:21.950" style="s2">organization of 12 people with any</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:24.579" style="s2">amount of system structure or supports</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.950" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">on have the wisdom of a billion people</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.579" end="01:06:30.290" style="s2">well probably not just because you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:33.049" style="s2">again just just sheer logarithm</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.290" end="01:06:34.700" style="s2">understandings of the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.049" end="01:06:37.760" style="s2">information flows we simply say okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.700" end="01:06:40.579" style="s2">well we can get maybe a square root</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:42.200" style="s2">level of you know reduction then the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.579" end="01:06:43.579" style="s2">number of nodes needing to process this</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.200" end="01:06:44.569" style="s2">amount of information but we really</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.579" end="01:06:46.819" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t try for better than that</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.569" end="01:06:48.290" style="s2">because otherwise we start losing the</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.819" end="01:06:51.349" style="s2">critical information necessary to make</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.290" end="01:06:54.770" style="s2">good choices so even though we know that</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.349" end="01:06:57.079" style="s2">from a market sense that distributed</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.770" end="01:06:59.839" style="s2">systems are less efficient in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.079" end="01:07:01.520" style="s2">of energy usage and sense of time and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.839" end="01:07:04.040" style="s2">sense of responsiveness you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.520" end="01:07:05.420" style="s2">they are ultimately necessary in order</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.040" end="01:07:06.890" style="s2">to do the work that needs to be done</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.420" end="01:07:09.730" style="s2">because we&#39;re actually looking at not an</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.730" end="01:07:14.839" style="s2">the quality of the choices being made by</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.950" end="01:07:17.299" style="s2">the not the platform but now the</p>

<p begin="01:07:26.869" end="01:07:31.640" style="s2">effect what we&#39;re really looking at here</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.309" end="01:07:33.650" style="s2">is is not relative thresholds but but</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.640" end="01:07:35.750" style="s2">absolute ones it not only has to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.650" end="01:07:37.220" style="s2">better than our current solutions it has</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.750" end="01:07:40.010" style="s2">to be good enough to actually be</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.010" end="01:07:44.990" style="s2">metric and that in effect this sets hard</p>

<p begin="01:07:49.069" end="01:07:54.170" style="s2">actually R which itself sets limitations</p>

<p begin="01:08:00.380" end="01:08:04.849" style="s2">we&#39;re really looking at are we asking</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:06.890" style="s2">the right questions do we have a way to</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.849" end="01:08:08.359" style="s2">know and and and and to very much</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.890" end="01:08:11.270" style="s2">develop a process in that particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.359" end="01:08:13.849" style="s2">area so in recognition of all of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.270" end="01:08:15.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve been what what I&#39;ve been doing to</p>

<p begin="01:10:28.910" end="01:10:32.360" style="s2">this critique about sense making because</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.830" end="01:10:34.760" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of talk about sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.360" end="01:10:35.320" style="s2">making and some attempts at it but one</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.320" end="01:10:38.889" style="s2">which you know does resonate with me to</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.030" end="01:10:40.869" style="s2">a degree is that from where we stand</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.889" end="01:10:43.239" style="s2">today where we&#39;re heading towards these</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.869" end="01:10:45.880" style="s2">existential risks at an accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.239" end="01:10:48.099" style="s2">rate since making by itself isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.880" end="01:10:50.349" style="s2">close to enough right because even if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.099" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">knew what the right things to do are and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.349" end="01:10:54.369" style="s2">truthfully probably you and me and three</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.139" style="s2">people that we know could sit around a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.369" end="01:10:57.969" style="s2">table and come up with a better</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.139" end="01:11:00.429" style="s2">trajectory than we&#39;re on today by a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.969" end="01:11:03.099" style="s2">shitload where is the mechanism to use</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.429" end="01:11:05.290" style="s2">the levers that can move the trajectory</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.099" end="01:11:07.329" style="s2">of society so since making a loan is</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.290" end="01:11:09.579" style="s2">just a waste of time frankly and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.329" end="01:11:11.440" style="s2">basically a wanking exercise unless</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.579" end="01:11:13.480" style="s2">there&#39;s the ability to actually change</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.440" end="01:11:15.280" style="s2">the trajectory of our society what do</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.480" end="01:11:16.659" style="s2">you say to that well actually I agree I</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.280" end="01:11:18.360" style="s2">never claimed that sense-making by</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.659" end="01:11:21.040" style="s2">itself would be enough I mean without</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.360" end="01:11:23.139" style="s2">since making choice making isn&#39;t enabled</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.040" end="01:11:25.420" style="s2">but choice making by itself isn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.139" end="01:11:27.460" style="s2">either so you know let&#39;s say you and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.420" end="01:11:29.650" style="s2">got together and we we spent a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.460" end="01:11:31.420" style="s2">time figured out the answer made some</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.650" end="01:11:33.250" style="s2">clear choices but then didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.420" end="01:11:34.929" style="s2">capacity to implement those choices to</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.250" end="01:11:37.719" style="s2">have a capacity to bring them you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.929" end="01:11:40.060" style="s2">into the world as Manifest results then</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.719" end="01:11:41.380" style="s2">to some extent those choices are choices</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.060" end="01:11:43.630" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this thing called the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.380" end="01:11:46.449" style="s2">principle of identity that which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.630" end="01:11:47.670" style="s2">indistinguishable must be the same so in</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.449" end="01:11:49.960" style="s2">effect if I can&#39;t distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.670" end="01:11:52.920" style="s2">having made a choice and not having made</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.960" end="01:11:55.719" style="s2">a choice ie there are no consequences</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.920" end="01:11:58.420" style="s2">then in effect you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.719" end="01:12:00.460" style="s2">no real sense of choice making so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.420" end="01:12:02.079" style="s2">know I definitely agree that bringing</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.460" end="01:12:04.810" style="s2">things in a manifestation having the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.079" end="01:12:07.329" style="s2">capacity to actually implement is is is</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.810" end="01:12:08.710" style="s2">a crucial thing but but I think that to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.329" end="01:12:11.770" style="s2">some extent what we&#39;re looking at here</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.710" end="01:12:13.630" style="s2">is not an either/or question so you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.770" end="01:12:16.270" style="s2">again sense making by itself is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.630" end="01:12:19.179" style="s2">enough choice making by itself is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.270" end="01:12:20.710" style="s2">enough implementation by itself is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.179" end="01:12:22.780" style="s2">enough because even if we had the</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.710" end="01:12:24.760" style="s2">capacity to implement whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.780" end="01:12:26.969" style="s2">that we chose the implementation</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.760" end="01:12:30.219" style="s2">capacity without any kind of guidances</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.969" end="01:12:32.739" style="s2">obviously also worthless so in effect</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.219" end="01:12:34.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense here of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.739" end="01:12:38.440" style="s2">necessary and what&#39;s sufficient so if we</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.510" end="01:12:41.440" style="s2">had sense making and choice making and</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.440" end="01:12:44.230" style="s2">implementation capacity then maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.440" end="01:12:45.969" style="s2">have a chance is that sufficient it</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.230" end="01:12:48.850" style="s2">might be at this particular point I</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.969" end="01:12:51.820" style="s2">think that you know if we hit the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.850" end="01:12:53.230" style="s2">quality of implementation that is needed</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.820" end="01:12:54.490" style="s2">if we hit the quality of choice making</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.230" end="01:12:56.290" style="s2">that is new if we have the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.490" end="01:12:58.480" style="s2">sense making that is needed then then</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.290" end="01:13:01.350" style="s2">you know is that those things being</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.480" end="01:13:04.120" style="s2">necessary is that sufficient to actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.350" end="01:13:06.130" style="s2">move ourselves out of crisis and into</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.120" end="01:13:09.160" style="s2">you know some sort of comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.130" end="01:13:10.480" style="s2">responsiveness well I think that it is I</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.160" end="01:13:12.370" style="s2">mean at this particular point you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.480" end="01:13:15.700" style="s2">I&#39;m working on a hard proof of that but</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.370" end="01:13:17.440" style="s2">the ultimate result here is is that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.700" end="01:13:19.630" style="s2">do know that those things are necessary</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.440" end="01:13:21.850" style="s2">because if we if we just look at</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.630" end="01:13:23.460" style="s2">implementation capacity by itself I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.850" end="01:13:25.720" style="s2">while we actually have that already</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.460" end="01:13:27.190" style="s2">institutions you know federal</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.720" end="01:13:28.750" style="s2">governments and and you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.190" end="01:13:31.510" style="s2">businesses and so on so forth already</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.750" end="01:13:33.040" style="s2">have all the resources necessary to to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.510" end="01:13:35.470" style="s2">to implement an enormous change you mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.040" end="01:13:37.870" style="s2">obviously changes have actually happens</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.470" end="01:13:39.790" style="s2">technology has been deployed social</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.870" end="01:13:42.760" style="s2">media platforms do exist and so on do</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.790" end="01:13:44.110" style="s2">railroads and so on and in effect what</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.760" end="01:13:45.970" style="s2">we&#39;re what we&#39;re looking here is saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.110" end="01:13:47.920" style="s2">okay well given that you know as</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.970" end="01:13:50.230" style="s2">individuals we can do great sense making</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.920" end="01:13:52.780" style="s2">but as individuals we have terrible</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.230" end="01:13:54.490" style="s2">implementation capacity and given that</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.780" end="01:13:56.740" style="s2">as institutions we have tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.490" end="01:13:58.720" style="s2">implementation capacity but terrible</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.740" end="01:14:00.190" style="s2">sense making capacity that to some</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.720" end="01:14:02.950" style="s2">extent we need to upgrade the sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.190" end="01:14:04.510" style="s2">making capacity because without that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.950" end="01:14:07.570" style="s2">can&#39;t have the institutions make choices</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.510" end="01:14:09.700" style="s2">that actually matter so you know is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.570" end="01:14:12.130" style="s2">structural design of the institutions as</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.700" end="01:14:14.680" style="s2">we currently conceive them able to</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.130" end="01:14:17.260" style="s2">essentially have all three at once sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.680" end="01:14:19.660" style="s2">making information gathering capacity</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.260" end="01:14:21.550" style="s2">that you know the quality of choices</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.660" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">that are comprehensive enough responsive</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.550" end="01:14:27.100" style="s2">enough to complex not just complicated</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.870" style="s2">design questions and then finally can we</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.100" end="01:14:30.250" style="s2">have those implementations occur in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.870" end="01:14:33.160" style="s2">way that is non corruptible that</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.250" end="01:14:35.800" style="s2">actually represents the choices that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.160" end="01:14:38.500" style="s2">made rather than say being co-opted by</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.800" end="01:14:40.330" style="s2">some third party for private benefit and</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.500" end="01:14:42.070" style="s2">so you know when we look at you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.330" end="01:14:43.810" style="s2">implementation systems as they exist</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.070" end="01:14:45.640" style="s2">currently we notice that corruption is</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.810" end="01:14:47.080" style="s2">an issue and you know again there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.640" end="01:14:48.970" style="s2">of governments in the world where</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.080" end="01:14:51.730" style="s2">effectively due to the necessary</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.970" end="01:14:53.320" style="s2">internal dynamics of those you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.730" end="01:14:55.120" style="s2">institutions that you know it&#39;s at some</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.320" end="01:14:57.430" style="s2">extent to just even ensure their own</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.120" end="01:14:59.620" style="s2">survival that they end up having to make</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.430" end="01:15:00.449" style="s2">very very poor choices with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.620" end="01:15:03.539" style="s2">the well-being of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.449" end="01:15:06.059" style="s2">and so in a lot of ways we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.539" end="01:15:09.090" style="s2">you know if we just focus on</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.059" end="01:15:10.590" style="s2">implementation criteria and basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.090" end="01:15:12.690" style="s2">look at it from that that point of view</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.590" end="01:15:14.099" style="s2">alone then we discover that we already</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.690" end="01:15:17.070" style="s2">need to do sense making and choice</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.099" end="01:15:19.170" style="s2">making about institutional design so</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.070" end="01:15:21.690" style="s2">that we can ensure that the the way in</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.170" end="01:15:23.010" style="s2">which those institutions manifest the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.690" end="01:15:25.829" style="s2">things that they do in the world don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.010" end="01:15:28.440" style="s2">end up doing more harm than good if you</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.829" end="01:15:31.229" style="s2">look at you know game theory game a</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.440" end="01:15:32.489" style="s2">particularly it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.229" end="01:15:34.979" style="s2">the case that people want to create</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.489" end="01:15:36.119" style="s2">markets particularly if you manage to</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.979" end="01:15:37.679" style="s2">create a new market and you create a</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.119" end="01:15:40.349" style="s2">platform on which that market happens</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.679" end="01:15:43.739" style="s2">then you get to essentially do a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.349" end="01:15:45.420" style="s2">Metcalfe&#39;s law growth process and also</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.739" end="01:15:48.329" style="s2">at the same time to be extracting value</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.420" end="01:15:50.880" style="s2">from that market charging taxes in one</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.329" end="01:15:53.010" style="s2">way or another you know charging rent or</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.880" end="01:15:53.809" style="s2">you know taking a percentage of profits</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.010" end="01:15:56.099" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.809" end="01:15:57.869" style="s2">that you know the upside for you as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.099" end="01:15:59.249" style="s2">market developer is enormous because you</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.869" end="01:16:01.110" style="s2">know and you&#39;re not just doing you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.249" end="01:16:02.579" style="s2">additive increase in wealth by the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.110" end="01:16:05.159" style="s2">results of your own efforts or a</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.579" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">multiplicative increase in wealth to say</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.159" end="01:16:09.300" style="s2">the way you would as banker but the now</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:10.530" style="s2">all the sudden you&#39;re doing exponential</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.300" end="01:16:13.050" style="s2">increase in wealth because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.530" end="01:16:15.900" style="s2">effectively creating a tap on an entire</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.050" end="01:16:18.019" style="s2">ecosystem that in effect of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.900" end="01:16:20.639" style="s2">is is that that process is parasitic and</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.019" end="01:16:22.260" style="s2">you know as you increase the number of</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.639" end="01:16:25.440" style="s2">parasites in the system eventually the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.260" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">wildebeest dies so you know in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.440" end="01:16:31.050" style="s2">ways what we&#39;re looking at here is you</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:35.550" style="s2">know we actually need good quality</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.050" end="01:16:37.320" style="s2">process for all three and that if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.550" end="01:16:39.449" style="s2">don&#39;t hit sufficient quality thresholds</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.320" end="01:16:41.459" style="s2">for all three that for sure this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.449" end="01:16:43.110" style="s2">going to be enough so yeah I actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.459" end="01:16:45.150" style="s2">agree with the critique that Seth making</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.110" end="01:16:46.739" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough but on the other hand if we</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.150" end="01:16:48.209" style="s2">don&#39;t at least apply good sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.739" end="01:16:50.429" style="s2">with respect to institutional design</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.209" end="01:16:51.479" style="s2">then you know whatever it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.429" end="01:16:53.699" style="s2">doing will probably end up being</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.479" end="01:16:56.010" style="s2">captured by some hidden party and used</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.699" end="01:16:57.570" style="s2">to their private benefit and just end up</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.010" end="01:17:00.119" style="s2">by as a side effect externalizing</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.570" end="01:17:01.320" style="s2">considerable harm to the well-being of</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.119" end="01:17:04.440" style="s2">the Commons to the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.320" end="01:17:07.079" style="s2">community and so you know personally you</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.440" end="01:17:09.420" style="s2">know when you when you think about do I</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.079" end="01:17:11.070" style="s2">have any real belief that the taxes that</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.420" end="01:17:13.650" style="s2">I pay are actually going to go to my</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.070" end="01:17:15.870" style="s2">well-being and if my</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.650" end="01:17:18.600" style="s2">that question is no than then you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.870" end="01:17:20.220" style="s2">my overall faith in the system is low</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.600" end="01:17:22.140" style="s2">enough that I&#39;m not interested in</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.220" end="01:17:24.510" style="s2">increasing their capacities in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.140" end="01:17:25.950" style="s2">implementation sense I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.510" end="01:17:28.470" style="s2">increasing their capacities at the</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.950" end="01:17:30.980" style="s2">choice making incense making levels and</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.470" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">and though unfortunately the gap is that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.980" end="01:17:36.120" style="s2">the sense making in choice making needs</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:39.410" style="s2">to be needs to essentially wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.120" end="01:17:42.570" style="s2">control of the implementation from a</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.410" end="01:17:45.000" style="s2">self-serving status quo that&#39;s the real</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.570" end="01:17:46.740" style="s2">challenge right in many countries is</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.000" end="01:17:48.570" style="s2">just pure corrupt yet but in many</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.740" end="01:17:51.570" style="s2">countries in our country it&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.570" end="01:17:53.400" style="s2">pure corruption but it&#39;s soft corruption</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.570" end="01:17:55.680" style="s2">of the political process by the vested</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.400" end="01:17:57.420" style="s2">interests yeah I agree there are some</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.680" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">real serious challenges here I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.420" end="01:18:01.260" style="s2">is in some respects you know speaking as</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:02.970" style="s2">an engineer</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.260" end="01:18:05.130" style="s2">seriously the the single most difficult</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.970" end="01:18:07.110" style="s2">problem I could even attempt to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.130" end="01:18:09.810" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.110" end="01:18:11.580" style="s2">some some real challenges here and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.810" end="01:18:13.770" style="s2">know I mean you you mentioned that one</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.580" end="01:18:15.870" style="s2">specifically but there are a host of</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.770" end="01:18:18.150" style="s2">others which are which are also quite</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.870" end="01:18:19.350" style="s2">gnarly and you know again this is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.150" end="01:18:20.820" style="s2">kind of thing where you know quite</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.350" end="01:18:23.190" style="s2">frankly I would love to have some some</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.820" end="01:18:24.780" style="s2">qualified help you know but in this</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.190" end="01:18:26.100" style="s2">particular sense you know I agree these</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.780" end="01:18:28.080" style="s2">are these are real issues and these are</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.100" end="01:18:29.900" style="s2">real challenges obviously if you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.080" end="01:18:32.010" style="s2">someone were to come up with some way of</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.900" end="01:18:33.420" style="s2">addressing these kind of things even</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.010" end="01:18:35.910" style="s2">then they&#39;d have to be very careful</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.420" end="01:18:38.040" style="s2">about it because you know trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.910" end="01:18:39.720" style="s2">suggest hey you know I&#39;m gonna wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.040" end="01:18:41.400" style="s2">control away I mean well first of all</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.720" end="01:18:42.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not even a question about control</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.400" end="01:18:45.480" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a question of influence</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.780" end="01:18:47.460" style="s2">does any neuron have control over what</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.480" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">the whole brain does does does the brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.460" end="01:18:51.510" style="s2">even have control over itself I know</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:54.660" style="s2">that you know in terms of just my own</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.510" end="01:18:56.700" style="s2">subjective self I I can try to you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.660" end="01:18:58.500" style="s2">control my state of feeling I can try to</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.700" end="01:19:00.000" style="s2">control my behavior and so on so forth</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.500" end="01:19:02.490" style="s2">but at best I&#39;m going to only do is</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.000" end="01:19:04.020" style="s2">learn good skills and to become</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.490" end="01:19:06.450" style="s2">increasingly adaptive increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.020" end="01:19:08.940" style="s2">healthy that&#39;s probably not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.450" end="01:19:10.200" style="s2">some sort of you know overthrow or some</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.940" end="01:19:12.990" style="s2">sort of coup it&#39;s going to be something</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.200" end="01:19:16.260" style="s2">more like you know a gradual adoption of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.990" end="01:19:17.340" style="s2">of better practices and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.260" end="01:19:19.080" style="s2">let&#39;s hope that that happens</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.340" end="01:19:20.129" style="s2">sufficiently well and sufficiently fast</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.080" end="01:19:21.959" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.129" end="01:19:23.969" style="s2">yes I was gonna say that&#39;s all well and</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.959" end="01:19:27.599" style="s2">good we know we&#39;ll gradually make the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.969" end="01:19:29.550" style="s2">Beast smarter but do we have time it all</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.599" end="01:19:32.249" style="s2">depends on do we fall into a positive</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.550" end="01:19:35.070" style="s2">feedback loop around climate is there a</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.249" end="01:19:37.769" style="s2">pandemic there&#39;s you know lots of ways</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.070" end="01:19:38.669" style="s2">we could we could run out of time and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.769" end="01:19:42.030" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.669" end="01:19:45.329" style="s2">question is the attempt to influence a</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.030" end="01:19:47.729" style="s2">sufficient tactical strategy or does</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.329" end="01:19:49.979" style="s2">there need to be something more decisive</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.729" end="01:19:52.260" style="s2">I think as far as and that question is a</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.979" end="01:19:54.389" style="s2">very good question it&#39;s like you know do</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.260" end="01:19:56.550" style="s2">we have enough time well that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.389" end="01:19:58.289" style="s2">unknowable thing I have no idea right I</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.550" end="01:19:59.820" style="s2">mean we can say hey these are issues if</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.289" end="01:20:01.349" style="s2">the feedbacks that are going on in these</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.820" end="01:20:03.239" style="s2">particular areas of crucial issues</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.349" end="01:20:04.619" style="s2">there&#39;s an increasing number of crucial</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.239" end="01:20:07.320" style="s2">issues that are near-term that need</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.619" end="01:20:09.179" style="s2">address you know as it becomes more and</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.320" end="01:20:11.010" style="s2">more obvious to people that hey we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.179" end="01:20:12.389" style="s2">are actually out of time we really need</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.010" end="01:20:14.939" style="s2">to be better at these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.389" end="01:20:17.090" style="s2">the problem with the reset processes is</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.939" end="01:20:19.409" style="s2">that you know you might hit reset but</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.090" end="01:20:21.209" style="s2">you&#39;re not necessarily kind of end up</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.409" end="01:20:23.429" style="s2">with a better state you you may have</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.209" end="01:20:24.869" style="s2">slowed things down a little bit but you</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.429" end="01:20:26.399" style="s2">still haven&#39;t developed the capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.869" end="01:20:28.649" style="s2">prevent it from happening all over again</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.399" end="01:20:29.969" style="s2">so for instance you know civilizations</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.649" end="01:20:32.099" style="s2">have come and go if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.969" end="01:20:33.239" style="s2">historical record that we have you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.099" end="01:20:35.070" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know a few hundred</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.239" end="01:20:37.139" style="s2">civilizations that have lasted a few</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.070" end="01:20:39.269" style="s2">hundred years some longer maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.139" end="01:20:41.249" style="s2">thousand years or so but very few of</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.269" end="01:20:44.010" style="s2">them in fact none of them are</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.249" end="01:20:45.989" style="s2">civilization right now is is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.010" end="01:20:47.909" style="s2">you know just on one of the longer sides</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.989" end="01:20:49.260" style="s2">but but there&#39;s no guarantee that our</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.909" end="01:20:50.789" style="s2">civilization is going to endure any</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.260" end="01:20:53.459" style="s2">longer than any of the other examples</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.789" end="01:20:54.809" style="s2">that have come and gone and so you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.459" end="01:20:58.320" style="s2">in effect what we&#39;re really concerned</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.809" end="01:20:59.929" style="s2">with here is can we upgrade the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.320" end="01:21:02.669" style="s2">in some fundamental way because</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.929" end="01:21:04.469" style="s2">regardless of how much time we have you</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.669" end="01:21:06.929" style="s2">know we still haven&#39;t changed anything</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.469" end="01:21:08.399" style="s2">so say we do the reset and we come out</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.929" end="01:21:10.199" style="s2">on the other side of that but all the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.399" end="01:21:12.419" style="s2">institutions that we make at that point</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.199" end="01:21:13.109" style="s2">all of the new civilization practices</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.419" end="01:21:15.059" style="s2">that we put in place</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.109" end="01:21:16.169" style="s2">you know coupled with the technology</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.059" end="01:21:18.329" style="s2">that has been discovered and</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.169" end="01:21:19.559" style="s2">rediscovered from our civilization you</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.329" end="01:21:20.879" style="s2">know end up creating those same</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.559" end="01:21:22.590" style="s2">existential risks those same</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.879" end="01:21:24.539" style="s2">civilization collapse dynamics the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.590" end="01:21:26.820" style="s2"> up market economies</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.539" end="01:21:28.530" style="s2">you know conflated interests and</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.820" end="01:21:30.389" style="s2">you know perverse incentives and all the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.530" end="01:21:31.800" style="s2">rest of that stuff that in effect we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.389" end="01:21:34.320" style="s2">just going to end up in this bloom and</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.800" end="01:21:35.940" style="s2">bust cycle the problem is is that given</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.320" end="01:21:38.820" style="s2">the level of technological development</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.940" end="01:21:40.530" style="s2">that we have we&#39;re now entangling entire</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.820" end="01:21:43.380" style="s2">ecosystem so reset at this particular</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.530" end="01:21:45.599" style="s2">point means you know reset for maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.380" end="01:21:47.579" style="s2">know a billion years or maybe never I</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.599" end="01:21:49.260" style="s2">mean it might be that we&#39;ve damaged the</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.579" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">ecology so much that the human species</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.260" end="01:21:54.480" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t endure and so in effect</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:56.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.480" end="01:21:58.010" style="s2">question here of we can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.340" end="01:22:00.420" style="s2">boom-and-bust cycles given the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.010" end="01:22:02.790" style="s2">asymmetric power of the technology so we</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.420" end="01:22:04.230" style="s2">have to actually develop new capacities</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.790" end="01:22:08.250" style="s2">and since making a choice making an</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.230" end="01:22:10.110" style="s2">implementation then we have even if we</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.250" end="01:22:11.760" style="s2">were looking at you know running out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.110" end="01:22:13.920" style="s2">time we would still need to do this and</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.760" end="01:22:16.409" style="s2">so in effect we&#39;re looking at it in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.920" end="01:22:17.820" style="s2">sense of okay well needs to be done</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.409" end="01:22:21.239" style="s2">either way regardless of the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.820" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">time I can&#39;t control or even know how</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.239" end="01:22:26.040" style="s2">much time I have but I do know that</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:28.679" style="s2">doing it while the current civilization</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.040" end="01:22:32.690" style="s2">context is in place that I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.679" end="01:22:37.199" style="s2">effectively do better design do better</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.690" end="01:22:40.770" style="s2">engineering and social process in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.199" end="01:22:43.310" style="s2">context of our existing civilization you</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.770" end="01:22:45.480" style="s2">know to create design for for new</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.310" end="01:22:47.699" style="s2">capacities to respond to these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.480" end="01:22:48.869" style="s2">issues using the context that we have so</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.699" end="01:22:50.670" style="s2">in that sense I would say you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.869" end="01:22:52.170" style="s2">resets not a good thing because you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.670" end="01:22:53.610" style="s2">coming out of a reset we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.170" end="01:22:55.110" style="s2">have the kind of capacities to even</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.610" end="01:22:56.849" style="s2">think about these issues because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.110" end="01:23:00.380" style="s2">basically living hand-to-mouth in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.849" end="01:23:02.639" style="s2">Stone Age again so in effect what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.380" end="01:23:04.590" style="s2">therefore saying is well I can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.639" end="01:23:06.989" style="s2">the time period I can&#39;t control the</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.590" end="01:23:09.360" style="s2">necessity the only thing I can do is use</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.989" end="01:23:11.099" style="s2">the resources that we have today as best</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.360" end="01:23:13.590" style="s2">as we possibly can to respond to this</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.099" end="01:23:15.719" style="s2">thing as quickly as we possibly can so</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.590" end="01:23:17.849" style="s2">as a result I end up basically asking</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.719" end="01:23:21.090" style="s2">for support you know can people provide</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.849" end="01:23:24.599" style="s2">you know good capacities to try to speed</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.090" end="01:23:25.800" style="s2">up our capacity to good do good sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.599" end="01:23:27.810" style="s2">make a good choice make a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.800" end="01:23:29.400" style="s2">institutional design in this space good</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.810" end="01:23:31.469" style="s2">Community Design ultimately Community</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.400" end="01:23:34.679" style="s2">Design because that&#39;s the the crux of it</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.469" end="01:23:36.059" style="s2">all is that you know in effect we have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.679" end="01:23:38.520" style="s2">better chance of doing it now than we</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.059" end="01:23:41.219" style="s2">would at any other point given that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.520" end="01:23:42.690" style="s2">can integrate things like</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.219" end="01:23:44.579" style="s2">all the knowledge we&#39;ve collected in</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.690" end="01:23:46.170" style="s2">science and technology sociology</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.579" end="01:23:49.199" style="s2">anthropology psychology philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.170" end="01:23:51.510" style="s2">metaphysics and just the works I mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.199" end="01:23:53.099" style="s2">literally at this point we have the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.510" end="01:23:56.519" style="s2">maximum amount of information and</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.099" end="01:23:58.409" style="s2">resource that we would ever really have</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.519" end="01:24:00.329" style="s2">to be able to solve the problem and we</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.409" end="01:24:02.280" style="s2">have the necessity to do it now because</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.329" end="01:24:04.349" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how long we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.280" end="01:24:06.269" style="s2">have to work on this so in effect the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.349" end="01:24:09.929" style="s2">only thing I can really do is to say</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.269" end="01:24:13.409" style="s2">very much that we really need to do a</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.929" end="01:24:15.659" style="s2">lot of development in this rates pretty</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.409" end="01:24:18.929" style="s2">much stat into and to really have the</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.659" end="01:24:20.340" style="s2">process that is creating this be very</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.929" end="01:24:22.739" style="s2">much a non-commercial thing because we</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.340" end="01:24:25.050" style="s2">know that the commercial processes is is</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.739" end="01:24:26.579" style="s2">messed up so in effect you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.050" end="01:24:28.800" style="s2">asking for donations rather than</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.579" end="01:24:31.019" style="s2">investments we&#39;re asking for time</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.800" end="01:24:33.300" style="s2">commitments rather than just you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.019" end="01:24:37.229" style="s2">dollars because you know without having</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.300" end="01:24:38.999" style="s2">some real good way to you know develop</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.229" end="01:24:40.499" style="s2">this in a way that integrates the</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.999" end="01:24:43.349" style="s2">comprehensive field of knowledge that</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.499" end="01:24:45.929" style="s2">has been the outcome of Western</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.349" end="01:24:48.210" style="s2">civilization and Eastern philosophies</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.929" end="01:24:49.619" style="s2">and all that you know what we have as</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.210" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">the world essentially at this particular</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.619" end="01:24:54.719" style="s2">point is both the need and at this point</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:57.329" style="s2">the best enablement we could ask for</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.719" end="01:24:59.130" style="s2">that&#39;s good we&#39;re getting close to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.329" end="01:25:00.659" style="s2">end of our time here and unfortunately I</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.130" end="01:25:02.820" style="s2">have lots of things I wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.659" end="01:25:04.559" style="s2">you about particularly some of my very</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.820" end="01:25:07.469" style="s2">favorite things from your thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.559" end="01:25:09.659" style="s2">small group practice you know your paper</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.469" end="01:25:11.130" style="s2">on the nature of human assembly I went</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.659" end="01:25:13.170" style="s2">and read that carefully I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.130" end="01:25:15.119" style="s2">questions and we&#39;ve talked before you</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.170" end="01:25:17.249" style="s2">and I offline about your ephemeral group</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.119" end="01:25:19.289" style="s2">process both very interesting but we</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.249" end="01:25:21.090" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for that so my exit</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.289" end="01:25:21.929" style="s2">question is something I found during my</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.090" end="01:25:25.110" style="s2">research</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.929" end="01:25:27.900" style="s2">you gave a TEDx talk called the accident</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.110" end="01:25:31.139" style="s2">of unconsciousness where you talked</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.900" end="01:25:34.110" style="s2">about how exceedingly unlikely it is for</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.139" end="01:25:36.239" style="s2">us to exist right and that gets very</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.110" end="01:25:39.329" style="s2">close to a topic that we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.239" end="01:25:42.809" style="s2">many times on this show which is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.329" end="01:25:44.999" style="s2">Fermi paradox the Fermi paradox is from</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.809" end="01:25:46.320" style="s2">Enrico Fermi during the Manhattan</p>

<p begin="01:25:57.180" end="01:26:01.020" style="s2">where we&#39;re at we&#39;ve now been searching</p>

<p begin="01:26:02.970" end="01:26:07.470" style="s2">found any and the reason I raise this</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.610" end="01:26:09.030" style="s2">because you you were actually close to</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.470" end="01:26:11.100" style="s2">it and in fact I think you were there</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.030" end="01:26:13.380" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t make it explicit as it</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.100" end="01:26:15.450" style="s2">strikes me that this is a hugely</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.380" end="01:26:18.240" style="s2">important maybe the single biggest</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.450" end="01:26:21.420" style="s2">question about humanity and its role in</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.240" end="01:26:24.000" style="s2">the universe if indeed we are alone and</p>

<p begin="01:26:24.000" end="01:26:27.390" style="s2">year old nerdy kid I would have said oh</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.890" end="01:26:30.240" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s 100 fad just like the</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.390" end="01:26:31.980" style="s2">physicists the young physicists at Los</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.240" end="01:26:34.170" style="s2">Alamos oh yeah certainly gotta be other</p>

<p begin="01:26:34.170" end="01:26:37.110" style="s2">more I&#39;ve learned about the more I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.220" end="01:26:39.120" style="s2">studied it more I&#39;ve thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.110" end="01:26:41.700" style="s2">the less sure I am I&#39;m now to the point</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.120" end="01:26:43.470" style="s2">where I&#39;m entirely agnostic but maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.700" end="01:26:45.540" style="s2">are alone and of course there are other</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.470" end="01:26:47.940" style="s2">folks like Stuart Kaufman we had on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.540" end="01:26:50.670" style="s2">show not long ago he believes that life</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.940" end="01:26:53.220" style="s2">always forms if the situation is even</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.670" end="01:26:55.200" style="s2">close to right maybe he&#39;s right maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.220" end="01:26:58.230" style="s2">the people that say it&#39;s an exceedingly</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.200" end="01:27:00.150" style="s2">rare event all right but where I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.230" end="01:27:01.920" style="s2">you were going was until we know more we</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.150" end="01:27:04.320" style="s2">probable it&#39;s probably safe for us to</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.920" end="01:27:06.900" style="s2">assume that we are unique and if we are</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.320" end="01:27:09.780" style="s2">unique in having reached the level of</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.900" end="01:27:13.590" style="s2">general intelligence one could say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.780" end="01:27:16.650" style="s2">we have a purpose as a species which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.590" end="01:27:19.110" style="s2">to bring the universe to life and if we</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.650" end="01:27:21.480" style="s2">destroy our life here or at least</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.110" end="01:27:23.760" style="s2">destroy our ability to leave the earth</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.480" end="01:27:25.740" style="s2">and to move out into the universe then</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.760" end="01:27:27.900" style="s2">we&#39;ll have squandered one of the perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.740" end="01:27:29.850" style="s2">the actual purpose of our existence I</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.900" end="01:27:31.140" style="s2">couldn&#39;t agree more I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.850" end="01:27:33.600" style="s2">absolutely the right direction to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.140" end="01:27:34.680" style="s2">thinking about this site I definitely</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.600" end="01:27:37.440" style="s2">have spent a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.680" end="01:27:40.350" style="s2">the Fermi paradox and its implications</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.440" end="01:27:41.520" style="s2">and relevance as you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.350" end="01:27:43.410" style="s2">mentioned in fact that was part of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.520" end="01:27:45.930" style="s2">reason why even put that section into</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.410" end="01:27:48.480" style="s2">the the tedx of the accident of</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.930" end="01:27:50.340" style="s2">unconsciousness and so in effect yes I</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.480" end="01:27:52.350" style="s2">do I do very much agree and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.340" end="01:27:53.880" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s a lot of good thinking in</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.350" end="01:27:56.100" style="s2">this space I&#39;m thinking particularly of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.880" end="01:27:58.830" style="s2">Anor Sandberg and some of his recent</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.100" end="01:28:01.530" style="s2">work in that which essentially uses</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.830" end="01:28:03.660" style="s2">information theoretic methods to to</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.530" end="01:28:04.950" style="s2">really address that question so I would</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.660" end="01:28:06.330" style="s2">definitely recommend taking a look at</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.950" end="01:28:07.280" style="s2">his work because he&#39;s addressing the</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.330" end="01:28:09.050" style="s2">question and</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.280" end="01:28:11.500" style="s2">kind of unique way and it&#39;s based upon</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.050" end="01:28:14.120" style="s2">you know how do we how do we think about</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.500" end="01:28:16.130" style="s2">questions like this using the tools of</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.120" end="01:28:18.320" style="s2">information theory and risk modeling and</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.130" end="01:28:20.090" style="s2">stuff like that another direction that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.320" end="01:28:22.340" style="s2">think is is particularly important as</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.090" end="01:28:24.530" style="s2">you mentioned is that you know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.340" end="01:28:28.280" style="s2">assume for example that we are you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.530" end="01:28:30.590" style="s2">the unique species the unique life in</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.280" end="01:28:33.200" style="s2">the universe I don&#39;t necessarily need to</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.590" end="01:28:34.850" style="s2">make that particular claim because even</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.200" end="01:28:36.890" style="s2">if there were life all over the universe</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.850" end="01:28:38.540" style="s2">in the sense of you know lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.890" end="01:28:39.800" style="s2">of different manifestations I could say</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.540" end="01:28:43.460" style="s2">that just from an information theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.800" end="01:28:46.580" style="s2">perspective there&#39;s still a huge degree</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.460" end="01:28:47.840" style="s2">of unity associated with this life so</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.580" end="01:28:50.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a gift there there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.840" end="01:28:52.160" style="s2">an enormous miraculousness associated</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.120" end="01:28:53.600" style="s2">with that gift and who to really</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.160" end="01:28:55.100" style="s2">appreciate that and to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.600" end="01:28:57.710" style="s2">it means that to some extent we actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.100" end="01:28:59.780" style="s2">have to get the ethics of that right one</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.710" end="01:29:02.240" style="s2">of the connections back to the Fermi</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.780" end="01:29:04.610" style="s2">paradox is that one of the ideas about</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.240" end="01:29:06.590" style="s2">you know why don&#39;t we see other</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.610" end="01:29:09.340" style="s2">intelligent life in the universe is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.590" end="01:29:12.290" style="s2">they very prudently would be aware of</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.340" end="01:29:14.030" style="s2">well I don&#39;t want to contact another</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.290" end="01:29:17.060" style="s2">civilization I want to ensure that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.030" end="01:29:18.230" style="s2">absolutely invisible because without an</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.060" end="01:29:20.510" style="s2">acknowledgement that there is</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.230" end="01:29:23.390" style="s2">essentially a little sufficiently</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.510" end="01:29:25.670" style="s2">developed level of ethical thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.390" end="01:29:27.200" style="s2">behavior if I don&#39;t see that the basis</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.670" end="01:29:31.040" style="s2">of choice that that particular species</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.200" end="01:29:32.090" style="s2">is implementing that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.040" end="01:29:34.190" style="s2">dangerous to talk to them</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.090" end="01:29:35.900" style="s2">so in effect think to think of it from</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.190" end="01:29:38.030" style="s2">like a first contact perspective right</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.900" end="01:29:40.190" style="s2">so given kind of the background I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.030" end="01:29:43.670" style="s2">thinking a little bit of the way Nick</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.190" end="01:29:45.710" style="s2">Bostrom would think of this is that okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.670" end="01:29:47.780" style="s2">so we have the possibility of initiating</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.710" end="01:29:49.790" style="s2">a first contact situation but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.780" end="01:29:52.760" style="s2">assume that both sides you know the</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.790" end="01:29:56.660" style="s2">contact II and the contact or both have</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.760" end="01:29:59.330" style="s2">enormous existential technology in other</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.660" end="01:30:01.310" style="s2">words they have the capacity to to</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.330" end="01:30:03.260" style="s2">leverage something like nuclear warheads</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.310" end="01:30:05.510" style="s2">and there&#39;s no defense like like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.260" end="01:30:08.000" style="s2">say that&#39;s it&#39;s the technology is so</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.510" end="01:30:09.770" style="s2">asymmetric in its power that if one side</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.000" end="01:30:11.510" style="s2">were to initiate an attack on the other</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.770" end="01:30:14.060" style="s2">that the defending side couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.510" end="01:30:15.650" style="s2">possibly defend and and so you know we</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.060" end="01:30:17.720" style="s2">say okay well</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.650" end="01:30:19.630" style="s2">to really make the point you you you say</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.720" end="01:30:22.670" style="s2">not only is it the case that there are</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.630" end="01:30:24.110" style="s2">hugely asymmetric technologies that that</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.670" end="01:30:26.810" style="s2">either side can have against the other</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.110" end="01:30:29.390" style="s2">but that there&#39;s essentially thousands</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.810" end="01:30:32.180" style="s2">of different kind of technologies each</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.390" end="01:30:34.900" style="s2">of which is asymmetric in this</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.180" end="01:30:39.850" style="s2">particular way and so you know if</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.900" end="01:30:43.430" style="s2">contactor a and contactee B both have</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.850" end="01:30:46.220" style="s2">any one of thousands of completely</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.430" end="01:30:47.510" style="s2">asymmetric technologies which from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.220" end="01:30:50.060" style="s2">perspective of the other one is both</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.510" end="01:30:52.280" style="s2">unknown like you know we may have</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.060" end="01:30:54.560" style="s2">developed completely asymmetric capacity</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.280" end="01:30:56.570" style="s2">and nuclear technology but they may have</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.560" end="01:30:59.030" style="s2">developed completely asymmetric Technica</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.570" end="01:31:00.230" style="s2">pasady in biological technology and some</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.030" end="01:31:02.210" style="s2">other party may have developed</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.230" end="01:31:04.580" style="s2">completely asymmetric capacity and</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.210" end="01:31:05.990" style="s2">compute technology now those happen to</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.580" end="01:31:08.180" style="s2">be ones that we know about but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.990" end="01:31:09.830" style="s2">assume that some other species some</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.180" end="01:31:13.160" style="s2">other race out in space somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.830" end="01:31:15.350" style="s2">another has developed three completely</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.160" end="01:31:17.990" style="s2">different technologies that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.350" end="01:31:21.260" style="s2">have names for and that effectively or</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.990" end="01:31:22.700" style="s2">just as as you know life destroying a</p>

<p begin="01:31:22.700" end="01:31:27.050" style="s2">destroying us as those three could be</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.320" end="01:31:29.450" style="s2">and so in effect we would basically say</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.050" end="01:31:31.580" style="s2">well since we have no idea if I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.450" end="01:31:34.070" style="s2">contactor and I&#39;m basically saying hey I</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.580" end="01:31:35.630" style="s2">want to talk to this other species but I</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.070" end="01:31:36.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know that that of the species I</p>

<p begin="01:31:51.350" end="01:31:54.980" style="s2">least we&#39;re not sure and that could</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.270" end="01:31:56.930" style="s2">indeed be the explanation one of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.980" end="01:31:59.810" style="s2">one of a hundred possible explanations</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.930" end="01:32:01.550" style="s2">and these are all important and I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.810" end="01:32:03.020" style="s2">the biggest part that is what we talked</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.550" end="01:32:05.900" style="s2">about just as we introduced this which</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.020" end="01:32:07.850" style="s2">is these are reasons why we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.900" end="01:32:09.590" style="s2">smart about preserving ourselves because</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.850" end="01:32:11.960" style="s2">we might be the only one which case if</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.590" end="01:32:13.670" style="s2">we blow it this is huge and even if</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.960" end="01:32:15.860" style="s2">we&#39;re not the only one to your point we</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.670" end="01:32:18.590" style="s2">do bring a very high level of uniqueness</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.860" end="01:32:20.300" style="s2">to the universe and over time we</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.590" end="01:32:23.270" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be able to spire perspective</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.300" end="01:32:25.640" style="s2">through the universe and to blow that is</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.270" end="01:32:27.560" style="s2">to blow something huge and that should</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.640" end="01:32:29.599" style="s2">be at least one of our motivations to</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.560" end="01:32:32.329" style="s2">think through these existential</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.599" end="01:32:36.439" style="s2">risks to find a way find a way somehow</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.329" end="01:32:38.269" style="s2">to get the wisdom of good God&#39;s now that</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.439" end="01:32:39.260" style="s2">we seem to have the power of God&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.269" end="01:32:40.639" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the reason why I</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.260" end="01:32:41.809" style="s2">mentioned the dark forest thing is</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.639" end="01:32:44.629" style="s2">because if there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.809" end="01:32:46.159" style="s2">additional reason if we assume that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.629" end="01:32:48.649" style="s2">know there&#39;s this background that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.159" end="01:32:50.209" style="s2">just sort of set up the only context in</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.649" end="01:32:52.729" style="s2">which any species would ever actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.209" end="01:32:54.979" style="s2">talk to another one is if they knew that</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.729" end="01:32:57.469" style="s2">the ethics that was implemented by the</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.979" end="01:33:00.260" style="s2">opposing party was at least sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.469" end="01:33:02.389" style="s2">to be able to be safe to talk to them so</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.260" end="01:33:04.369" style="s2">in effect it&#39;s a bit like you know I</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.389" end="01:33:06.499" style="s2">mentioned the nonrelativistic ethics is</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.369" end="01:33:08.539" style="s2">the second path or the second aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.499" end="01:33:11.989" style="s2">that TED talk and it&#39;s critically</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.539" end="01:33:14.149" style="s2">important because if we as a world have</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.989" end="01:33:16.340" style="s2">an ethics which is to that standard to</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.149" end="01:33:18.550" style="s2">that level of thing then it becomes at</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.340" end="01:33:20.629" style="s2">least possible that other species other</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.550" end="01:33:22.280" style="s2">worlds would want to talk to us and</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.629" end="01:33:24.439" style="s2">share resources and actually be in some</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.280" end="01:33:26.409" style="s2">sort of relationship without that level</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.439" end="01:33:29.449" style="s2">of development at least at a minimum</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.409" end="01:33:31.369" style="s2">then we&#39;re just basically too unsafe to</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.449" end="01:33:33.530" style="s2">talk to and effectively the predator</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.369" end="01:33:35.899" style="s2">nature ends up being the dominant factor</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.530" end="01:33:38.389" style="s2">and so in effect we&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.899" end="01:33:39.889" style="s2">saying you know if we want to find other</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.389" end="01:33:41.539" style="s2">intelligent life in the universe we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.889" end="01:33:44.300" style="s2">to be a fit receptacle for that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.539" end="01:33:46.729" style="s2">information and so in effect it then</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.300" end="01:33:48.439" style="s2">becomes incumbent upon its even in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.729" end="01:33:50.149" style="s2">sense of maybe we&#39;re not to see the</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.439" end="01:33:52.129" style="s2">universe but just to essentially be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.149" end="01:33:54.379" style="s2">participant a citizen of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.129" end="01:33:55.939" style="s2">that we have to be a good citizen and a</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.379" end="01:33:58.459" style="s2">good citizen to some extent means that</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.939" end="01:34:01.070" style="s2">we need to do enough self work not only</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.459" end="01:34:03.829" style="s2">to survive but also to actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.070" end="01:34:06.829" style="s2">participate an even better reason to get</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.829" end="01:34:08.119" style="s2">our straight I agree all right on</p>
