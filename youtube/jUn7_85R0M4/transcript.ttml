<p begin="00:00:04.240" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">is a digital campfire where we cohere in</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.640" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">about what matters most at the knife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">edge of what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.400" style="s2">so when you suggested uh you want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.960" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">talk about stoicism your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.400" end="00:00:26.320" style="s2">take on it and what you see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:28.720" style="s2">representing stoicism and maybe kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.320" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">have a metamodern or developmental lens</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.720" end="00:00:32.079" style="s2">what kind of sparked that i guess just</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">maybe just rift or free associate on</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.079" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">your thoughts in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">that area</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:41.040" style="s2">i think i&#39;d be curious if i could know a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.280" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.040" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">um for this group of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:46.480" style="s2">assembling here at a place called the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">stoa</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.480" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">what in terms of stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">familiar and kind of shared and also in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:58.160" style="s2">terms of metamodernism so</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">i can have a sense of how to relate</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.160" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">um so i can kind of speak on the behalf</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">of maybe the stoic group or the regulars</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">but in the meantime there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">faces i don&#39;t recognize here so you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">drop them in the chat box i just say</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">what your</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">familiar familiarity with stoicism or</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">i would say that more people at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">the regulars are more familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.400" style="s2">metamodernism there&#39;s book clubs on you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.040" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">know hanzi&#39;s book and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.400" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">than they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:26.479" style="s2">with stoicism um because we hardly have</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:27.759" style="s2">any events on stoicism here it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.479" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">like a space that&#39;s stewarded</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.759" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">by a stoic but we don&#39;t really talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">about stoicism and i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">sophisticated uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">the understanding is of metamodernism um</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">as you can see from the chats there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">bunch of people already dropping down</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">they&#39;re familiar with metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">um but i also imagine there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:45.680" style="s2">people that are coming in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">might have heard the terms but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.680" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">know much about it so you probably have</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">a mixed bag of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">of understanding here</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m definitely not a scholar of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">ancient stoic philosophy there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">a number of stoic philosophers that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">have read and appreciated</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">i actually read them later in life i</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">grew up more on eastern philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">traditions and got into the western</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">traditions later</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">but when you&#39;re studying vedanta or</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">buddhism there are ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">are very similar to stoic ideas there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">some some things that are quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">different but</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">some things that are similar in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">what is virtue how do you cultivate it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">how do you cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">increased strength and resilience of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">character under adversity how do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">become at peace with death and those</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">types of things</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">and uh the actual word stoic</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even know there was a greek</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">tradition until</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">i was a bit later and the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">heard it was actually a very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">simple cartoonish version that i think a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">lot of people have heard that just meant</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">like have a stiff upper lip</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">and don&#39;t show emotions there was um</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">there was something as i got into</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">psychotherapy in that community was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">completely rejected as this is a way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">fragment yourself and spiritually bypass</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">repress emotionality and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">and so i think it&#39;s very important in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">this way when we talk about meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">um uh if you read</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">marcus aurelius or seneca or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">they they&#39;re not just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">keep a step flip there they&#39;re inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">um how do we relate with our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">and our desires and our thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">in a way that moves us in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">of what is meaningful and what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">fundamentally meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">and so specifically the idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">was this relationship between logic and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">uh and so it was both epistemology how</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">do we do better</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">clear thinking about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:47.440" style="s2">ourself and reality in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">and how do we cultivate the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.440" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">virtue in ourselves and the positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.080" style="s2">relationship between those so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">that the true the good and the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.080" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">were actually facets of an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:57.439" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">it was a emerging from an intuition of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.439" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">an integrated metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">distinctly different in the greek</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">enlightenment than in the later european</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">is um in the later</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">european enlightenment not as much early</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">in the renaissance but later</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">the epistemology section</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">which got reified with the methods of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">science became very much about what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">but in a way that was seen as</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">fundamentally incommensurable with what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">ought</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">and now of course lots of people had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.880" style="s2">sense of an ethics whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">the founding fathers being deistic while</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.880" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">being um</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">you know focused on uh science</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">but ultimately the the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">science grounds itself in repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">measurements</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">we measure something we repeat the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">measurements we come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">you know predictions based on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.720" style="s2">hypothesis and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">science formally exists within to study</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">the objective and the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:05:01.039" style="s2">simultaneously measurable and repeatable</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">and that gives is but oh it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.039" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist there you have to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">some value statements about what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">if we okay a measure can show are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:08.800" style="s2">moving towards or away from but what</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.800" end="00:05:12.639" style="s2">which is why the uh the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">by itself tends to orient in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">nihilistic direction</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">um big bang happened because who knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">why no particular reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">random combinatorics you know et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:29.919" style="s2">and i think we can actually see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">the problems in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.919" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">through the lens of the is odd</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.680" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:39.600" style="s2">where science is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.680" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">has become an incredibly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.600" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">epistemology for studying what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">objectively that can then be applied via</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">to changing what is right and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">my uh if my choices are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">leveraged by intercontinental ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">missiles as opposed to arrows</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.479" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a much more powerful leverage to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">able to change</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">reality but then there&#39;s this question</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:06.639" style="s2">well what are we applying the technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">towards what is the world that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.639" end="00:06:11.600" style="s2">actually want what is worth wanting</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">and science&#39;s opinion is we formally</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.600" end="00:06:15.520" style="s2">have no opinion on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">and any position on that is equally</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.520" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">ungrounded because it&#39;s not emerging</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">from something that the methods of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">science themselves can validate</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">and so then well what ends up funding</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:25.039" style="s2">the research</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">is what&#39;s going to have return on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.039" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">investment so basically capital returns</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">and more generally game theory ends up</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">being the thing so then</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">the nihilism of social darwinism becomes</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">the because good basically becomes what</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">wins at game theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very not only superficial</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">but eventually self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:50.080" style="s2">definition of good</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">so um so yeah when i think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">stoicism i think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">deep contemplation on what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">good what is desirable what&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">desiring</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:08.160" style="s2">basically a reified ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">a reified epistemology and is there a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.160" end="00:07:11.919" style="s2">unified metaphysics from which those can</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.039" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">both arise</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">as a basis of how do we do choice making</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">and ultimately that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">is how to inform human choice towards an</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:23.759" style="s2">effective life individually and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">collectively at different scales</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.759" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">i&#39;m focused on a lot right now is uh the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">collective scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">since the beginning of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">civilization like early</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">egypt sumeria whatever</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">a tiny percentage of all the people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">have ever lived</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">lived in democracies or republics lived</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">in a system that had any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">governance almost everybody lived under</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.840" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">feudalism or monarchy or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:52.240" style="s2">autocratic control</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">and the few times that democracies or</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.240" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">republics</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">occurred they occurred following a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:59.440" style="s2">cultural enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">and it was a cultural enlightenment that</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.440" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">had to do a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.960" style="s2">it had to do something in both is and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">ought</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.960" end="00:08:09.039" style="s2">and specifically in the is space it had</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">to get objective and intersubjective so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.039" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">i&#39;ll say what i mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">we see the athenian democracy coming out</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">of kind of a greek enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">and the greek enlightenment was</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">everybody should learn logic</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">and learn history and learn math and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">learn rhetoric and learn the arts and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:26.639" style="s2">if you have a high value on education</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">where everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.639" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">assess base reality on their own not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">just say what someone else said because</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">you know the great authority in the past</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:34.959" style="s2">said it but everyone can actually assess</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">space reality on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.959" end="00:08:39.519" style="s2">then you have the unifying capab the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:42.399" style="s2">unifying nature of reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.519" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">and the other key part was the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.399" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">method the socratic dialectic where</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">everyone could take everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">and position in the european</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">enlightenment later it was the hegelian</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">dialectic and the kind of methods of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">science but if everyone can assess base</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">reality on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.240" style="s2">and they can take each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">perspective they end up being like we</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.240" end="00:09:02.800" style="s2">don&#39;t need rulers we can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">conversations and be able to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.800" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">self-governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">um but there also did have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">shared culture they all emerged</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">that cultural enlightenment valued those</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">things right and it also had some other</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">ideas of what is good that it values</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:18.480" style="s2">same with the founding of this country</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.480" end="00:09:25.200" style="s2">notice i got some feedback all right</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.200" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">so most everyone can sense that the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">been undergoing radical decay and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s kind of near the</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:38.320" style="s2">end of like being much of anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">and democracy&#39;s never made it past 300</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.320" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">years we&#39;re 250 years currently</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:45.760" style="s2">i think it&#39;d be good if everybody was</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">unmute</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.760" end="00:09:49.760" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just going to force everyone on</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">mute and then i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.760" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">ask you to unmute yourself there you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">all right um</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">and so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">the cultural enlightenment i i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.079" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">a bit off topic but but it tells you how</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:13.040" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:13.920" style="s2">um george washington and the founding of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.040" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">this country said</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.920" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">that the number one goal of government</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">should be the comprehensive education of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">every citizen in what he called the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">science of government</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:23.920" style="s2">basically everyone needed educated about</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">how humans work and how human</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.920" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">coordination works well enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">that they can really participate and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">jefferson said if i could have perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">news in a broken government or perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">government broken news i take perfect</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">news because if people understand the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">world they live in they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">overthrow the corrupt government and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">make sense of things and coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">but i think the key thing there is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">collective choice making requires</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">and collective perspective taking i have</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">to be able to understand how other</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">people are seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">to then be able to work on strategies</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">that are effective together so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">i think either kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">decay that&#39;s happened in the us and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">other places continues and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">many areas of the world have already</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">moved back to more autocratic governance</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">we see that happening in brazil and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">venezuela and turkey and</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.360" style="s2">metamodern so there was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">the greek enlightenment could be thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.360" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">of as a pre-modern enlightenment we</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">could think of the european</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">of that allowed us to actually produce</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.200" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">um so modernity brought the capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">the world but it also brought</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">oppress the world more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">so then post-modernism of course was</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">a bunch of largely valid critiques</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">of the problems of modernity but without</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">it was deconstruction but without a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">reconstruction for how to build so then</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">basically the only thing it can do</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">is critique building and which is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">entropic direction</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">so the meta-modern idea which i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">everyone&#39;s familiar with is is there an</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">epistemology that can take the relevant</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">critiques of post-modernism and actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">factor them into a better</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">better modernity or meta-modernity that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">in it has to be an integrated</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.760" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">and so when i think of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.519" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">stoicism i think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">uh both</p>

<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">we need better participatory governance</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">work on solutions at all and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">the basis of that will be people that</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">so maybe maybe i&#39;ll start here and uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">for people listening if you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">questions start throwing them in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">chat box have like a question</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">uh so i can i can fish for them because</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">a lot of the comments in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">chat box um you mentioned something when</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">we were chatting on whatsapp about</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">uh what your current take was on</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">how stoicism is being presented uh today</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">in you know uh the popular culture and</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">how it&#39;s being kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:05.040" style="s2">repurposed by certain i guess maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">masculine or self-help</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">help kind of gritted out type type folks</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:17.040" style="s2">so the question is do i have a critique</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.040" end="00:14:21.120" style="s2">the modern presentation of stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">either a critique on how modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.120" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">socialism is presented or just what your</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">on how it&#39;s currently being presented i</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">um i i don&#39;t feel like i know the</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">modern stoic authors very well i know a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">few things that seem like they have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.880" style="s2">elements right and some</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">fairly superficial um one thing i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.880" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">the superficial understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">stoicism that looks a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">logic over emotions and a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">on one side and then the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">let&#39;s call it trauma aware perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">pays more attention to what the effect</p>

<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">feelings are shadow work gestalt work</p>

<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">the two things that you don&#39;t ever want</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">to do with emotions is</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">immediately act out on them or repress</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">right and those are both dysfunctional</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">signal for you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.839" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s actual intelligence and</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">between my value system and how i&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:02.560" style="s2">of conditioned to show up and i&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">how do i close that delta that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.560" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">interesting inquiry but as much as there</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">deepening virtue and enabling there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">also the how do i relate to this in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">way that empowers me that i can continue</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.360" style="s2">to relate to life</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">with more capacity to be in service to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.360" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">what i care about</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">and uh i think it&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">question when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">emotions and difficulty of um</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a kind of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">that is different than cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:34.559" style="s2">intelligence which is kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:36.080" style="s2">power intelligence or agentic</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.559" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.080" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">if those aren&#39;t bound together you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">develop power that is not bound to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">virtue that ends up being quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">destructive</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">but if you develop virtue that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.440" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">bound to power it&#39;s basically impotent</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">um so how you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">virtue wisdom power all co-developed</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">in so you&#39;re capable of service and know</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re in service to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">is the thing that i think is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">interesting and worth exploring</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">cool um so we have a lot of questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">now so i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">pivot to the chat box um and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">give everyone the opportunity to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">themselves so use this power</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">with wisdom um pranab you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">if you can unread yourself and ask it to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">daniel</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">yeah so uh thanks for this talk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">awesome so far</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">you scroll up to the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">um yeah so basically what are some ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:32.640" style="s2">that you think</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">metamodernism or at least the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.640" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">epistemology um</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">hymenomonarism can be taught</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">or kind of encouraged within oneself</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">within dialogue with another person or</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">scale like at a community or society</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">i&#39;ll share a few things but it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">more like a couple random smatterings</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">than a comprehensive addressing of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">the pedagogy because how i would answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">for kindergartners versus high schoolers</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">and for people with different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">investment and existing familiarity is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:14.280" style="s2">obviously going to be quite different</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:17.339" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.280" end="00:19:17.339" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">a couple things in the academy there has</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:25.120" style="s2">been this</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">major divide most of the time between</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.120" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">the liberal arts and the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">between something that orients</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">more towards uh interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">versus or inter-subjective versus</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">but to make sense of society you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">need both working together</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">you need to be able to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">other people believe why they believe it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">and what&#39;s the actual signal in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">and what base reality regarding</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">objective things are</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">so to be oriented to both empiricism and</p>

<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">is a key part so some processes for how</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">take anything in the world that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:08.400" style="s2">trying to sense make or that someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">trying to sense me and trying to help</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.400" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">them with it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">and one thing i would have them do is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">say okay find</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.559" style="s2">all the narratives that make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">this that are out there what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.559" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">primary narratives it&#39;s like the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">tribes or kind of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">generating clusters right so if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">trying to make sense of the india china</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">war i&#39;m trying to make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">blm protests there&#39;s obviously um</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">conspiracy narratives far right moderate</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">antifa whatever so i would try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">generate the narrative landscape so i</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">say what are the ways that different</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">humans are making sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">and then i would try to steal man all</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:48.159" style="s2">the arguments i would try to actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">find the very strongest version of each</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:52.880" style="s2">of those narratives</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">and make it as reified as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.880" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">that i really understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">why they&#39;re understanding that and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">i can look for the signal in it because</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:02.159" style="s2">there&#39;s never no signal</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">then i would use some propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.159" end="00:21:05.760" style="s2">logic and break the narrative into</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:10.400" style="s2">individual propositions</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.760" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">right so a narrative is always that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.400" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">the bricks were put there by this for</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">this purpose the cops did this whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">it is break down the propositions</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">and then i would look for what evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">do those groups give to support each of</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">the propositions and what can what sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">can i make of that evidence</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">and what additional evidence can i find</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">and i would seek to both try to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">verify and falsify each proposition</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">and then stepping while acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">that i might not be able to verify or</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:39.520" style="s2">falsify i might just be able to say this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.520" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">proposition for which i i can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:44.080" style="s2">ground it one way or the other at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:45.840" style="s2">and all i can do is sit in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.080" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">uncertainty and ask questions around</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.840" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">where the burden of proof should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">so this is why peter was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">comfort with uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">earlier if i&#39;m not comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">then i&#39;m going to rush to premature</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">certainty and just be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">stuff i have to be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">uncertainty to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">do the epistemics necessary to come up</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">with appropriate certainty but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">comfort with uncertainty doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">want increasing certainty right it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">in an epistemic drive</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">that wants to figure shit out it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to believe shit without</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">having gone through the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">to have the right calibrated confidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">margin it also means i never</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">make what is most sacred to me attached</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">to that belief system where now i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">change it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">right because the confidence margin will</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">and then to seek to do analysis on each</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">to calibrate confidence appropriately to</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">after the analysis and be able to look</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">at the whole thing and say</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">what higher order perspectives are</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">and what additional information would we</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">this is one way of being able to help</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.760" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">learn how to think better</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">i could give lots and lots of examples</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">like this becomes a very rich topic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:01.360" style="s2">we start to get into what should the</p>

<p begin="00:25:01.360" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">what should the future of a civilization</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">right and we had some congruent sense of</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">comes on is a very good system to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">people to ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">much much better questions including</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">questions that they didn&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">were things</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:49.279" style="s2">thank you just to piggyback on that um</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">i&#39;m designing a session for rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.279" end="00:25:52.080" style="s2">on friday on thursday about memetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.080" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to like play different</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">videos of like trump aoc</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">all these political medic tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">process it emotionally first before we</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">inquire to the propositions</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:05.360" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s that the exercise that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">you mapped out about looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.360" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">narratives do you think that could also</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">repurposed for some kind of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">integration work</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s a few ways that i would i</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">mean pro</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">noticing the emotions and giving some</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:28.159" style="s2">space to process them means that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.159" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">covertly hijacking your sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">because you&#39;ve made them overt so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">right um if i know that i&#39;m angry or i</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">know that i&#39;m scared i can actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">look for how that&#39;s affecting my sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">making and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">complex scenarios it&#39;s very rarely</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">like a simple equation how anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">in all societal and ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:55.919" style="s2">psychology things are complex it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.400" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">usually that there&#39;s a hundred different</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.919" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">causal factors that are changing</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">and nexus causation enough stuff happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">to move something across a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">so what happens why two people who both</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">have expertise in climate change and are</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">earnestly trying to figure it out can</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">come to such different senses or</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:13.279" style="s2">on immunity or anything complex is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">because they</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.279" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">weight the variables differently</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">intuitively without realizing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">they recognize these are all variables</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">but their life experience has them</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">weight some of them more than others</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">and so to notice our own waiting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">where bias usually shows up</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">and the emotions are a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">way to start to be able to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">so if i&#39;m looking at trump and aoc and</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">i might have emotion come up because</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">of having adopted enough in-group</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">out-group type of stuff that i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">responding</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">group out group group think triggered</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">kind of stuff and i want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">and this is why you actually have to</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">um so if you have a value around that</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">bought into</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">a particular chunk of rhetoric right</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">actually there&#39;s a narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">happening and it won and it captured me</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">and made me a narrative soldier and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">thought i</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">was choosing a free will and not really</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">uh where those people&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">strikes me as existentially risky so</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">much that i can&#39;t listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">right them them not being willing to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">wear masks means that they are science</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">denying flat earth grandma killers and</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">and or whatever it is right them</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:34.320" style="s2">outside of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.399" style="s2">narrative frame that i&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.320" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">accepted so that&#39;s one thing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.399" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">emotions might give me</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">another thing they might give me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">even deeper is</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">okay so i&#39;m looking at homelessness or</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">amazon destruction or whatever and i</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.360" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">or i&#39;m angry or i&#39;m afraid any of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">negative emotions are actually showing</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">me something sacred to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">the anger is i&#39;m seeing something sacred</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m looking at who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">who&#39;s violating it i&#39;m focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">blame side but what</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">the basis of it is is there something i</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">love and care about</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.240" style="s2">that if i didn&#39;t there would be no</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">emotional energy of anything i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.240" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">protect or that i cared was being harmed</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">i&#39;d just be like yeah fuck i cut the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">amazon i don&#39;t give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">i&#39;m only angry because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">i actually really care about so if i</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">trace the fear or the anger or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">sadness back to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">what is it that is actually sacred to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">that i&#39;m trying to be in service of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a helpful piece of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">then i can say</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">okay so i know what is sacred to me i</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">it do i understand what is harming it or</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">could harm it well enough that i can</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">come up with solutions</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">if not can i seek to understand better</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">that i can actually be effective</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">and what way of relating to these</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">emotions helps me be in most</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">service so if i hold the sadness in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">way that decreases my agency i just get</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">overwhelmed and depressed and crippled</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">not in service to what i care about and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">so the stoic what is it that empowers me</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">if i actually care about that i have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">care can&#39;t be impotent</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.720" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">right the love can&#39;t be impotent it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">to actually be able to act and be in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">service to what&#39;s cared about</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">so how can i relate to this that most</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">empowers me to be an effective service</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">towards what is sacred to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:27.120" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s really good i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.120" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">okay um oh man</p>

<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">a question privately</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">uh if you&#39;re going to mute yourself ask</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">it to daniel</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:51.279" style="s2">hey bonnie hi see you um</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">my question is</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">where does this kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">and epistemic precision</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:13.279" style="s2">where does does where what is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">boundary of that does that fit</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">it obviously it fits in this world</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.200" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">but does it fit in your personal life</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.200" end="00:32:24.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">like like and how does that meld through</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.159" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">because most of us don&#39;t have the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">of mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">the kind of capacity you have and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">we want to take that part of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">offering</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:42.320" style="s2">and meld that into our personal lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:44.000" style="s2">i i is that is that a question that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.320" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">can understand so far</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.000" end="00:32:49.840" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great question actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">i think it&#39;s most important for most</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.840" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">people there and actually easiest</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:54.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:57.760" style="s2">our personal live situations don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.960" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">the same level of complexity as</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.760" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">all the things connected to climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">change fortunately so we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">expert level skills in 24 different</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">fields to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:08.840" style="s2">understand why our partner feels the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">thing they feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.840" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">um yeah so my personal life</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">seek first to understand before seeking</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.640" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">to be understood is as deep a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">wisdom as anything i&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s not complicated</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s simple it&#39;s only hard when the ego</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">gets hijacked and really fucking wants</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">to say what it wants to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">and so there has to be a value around</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">i actually don&#39;t want that hijacked ego</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:43.279" style="s2">place to get to run me</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">now i&#39;m not going to in order to be</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.760" style="s2">there are certain ways of repressing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">that just make it worse i want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.760" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">actually be able to understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:52.480" style="s2">arises why it arises what its hooks are</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">how i work with those</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.480" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">so that i can actually become more</p>

<p begin="00:34:05.039" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">because i feel that i lived aligned with</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">and if so we take a break so that if</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">she need to be able to feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">better to feel heard to return to center</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">and then if i have something i&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">see the pattern in it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">and say that&#39;s the same pattern</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:57.280" style="s2">practically</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:37:02.560" style="s2">at this larger scale because it has</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.280" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">it has deep feeling in that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:06.839" style="s2">i have no idea what i&#39;m saying right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.839" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">like instead of like over here i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">this and over here i&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">does this pattern somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t know yeah no i like it because</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;m describing at the macro scale kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">of dry and sterile</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.560" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">because in my relationship it&#39;s not dry</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:32.359" style="s2">yeah i wouldn&#39;t say dry and sterile i</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">would say is</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.359" end="00:37:36.880" style="s2">hyperinformed so so i&#39;m not trying to be</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">between like because in you</p>

<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">like one way that i i&#39;ll i&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.680" style="s2">an epistemic tool that i use to</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">i and this is like a a set of formal</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">systems from information theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:27.200" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">i look at a situation and try to say how</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.200" end="00:38:32.079" style="s2">many orders of magnitude of interactions</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">in the network diagram are occurring um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.079" end="00:38:35.280" style="s2">if it&#39;s an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">maybe you know we have some basis of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.280" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">being able to say at what level of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">action this is always hard because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">question is where is the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:40.720" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">i could say it&#39;s the whole fucking</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.720" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">universe for everything which is</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:46.000" style="s2">but i have to say at which nexus</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.040" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">causation is being</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:49.920" style="s2">very significantly informed i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">at what 10 to the 12 orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.920" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">of complexity in this situation or</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">then i want to look at the various</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">hypotheses</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">narrative as a set of hypotheses and</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">and be able to say what data do i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">that supports it what do i have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">either supports</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">a mutually exclusive hypothesis or</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:11.520" style="s2">directly refutes it</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">and i want to take that down i want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.520" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">use information compression to say what</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">least number of bits in which i can</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">so then i get to see the total unique</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">of the unique bits of information</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">it but also the total number of bits of</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">i have relative to the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">scenario so even if i have 10x more</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">supporting than refuting but the total</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">amount of info i have is tiny relative</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:38.480" style="s2">to the complexity my confidence will be</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">low</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.480" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">so this this sounds like a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">logical process which isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:47.680" style="s2">what it feels like and if i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">with my wife right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.680" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">um but that&#39;s because the total amount</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">of complexity in the situation with my</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">wife is just not</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">climate change right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">it&#39;s uh i actually want to be hyper</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">informed</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">there it&#39;s just easier right i want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.240" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">what is she thinking why is she feeling</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">that way what brought it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">you know what brought it about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">needs feel unmet for her what would</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">feel meaningful and so i&#39;m seeking to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:18.880" style="s2">hyperinformed there and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">hyperinformed i&#39;m seeking to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.880" end="00:40:23.440" style="s2">adequately informed</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">that i&#39;m in touch with reality</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.440" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">um and then once i&#39;m like oh i get it i</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">where she&#39;s coming from and i guess why</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">she feels the way she is and why she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">expressing that then i feel like i can</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">start to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">but i can&#39;t navigate when i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">the map at all yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">yeah so just so we&#39;re on the same page</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">hyperinformed is not a pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">like i think i think that&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">but for you you&#39;re like hyperinformed</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">you put that book aside and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">like act in a feeling sense so</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna say something really crazy</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">like i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:04.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t even i don&#39;t even like what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.000" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">what if we take that kind of action</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">logics with your wife</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">and put it to like ecology in the earth</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">and have the ace and the hole</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">are hyper-informed reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">which i actually think you do</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">like there&#39;s a kind of loving of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:37.440" style="s2">earth in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">in the life force that&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.440" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">actual logics you have with your wife</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">and then you have this hyperinformed</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">what if we could communicate that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.359" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">i think i think that&#39;s the point right</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:59.359" style="s2">so i see that all in you</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">well i mean in all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.359" end="00:42:03.119" style="s2">when we were talking about binding</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">wisdom virtue and power</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.119" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">we can that&#39;s almost like uh three</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">chakras depending upon how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">define it right</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">and you could take the chakra system or</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">any ancient system that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">was trying to explore this as like if i</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">the piece of hindu artwork if i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">the hindu chakra system as each of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">representing a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">the growth of the person was</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">to develop all of them and all of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">in relationship with each other so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">whole being could be in a full</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">relationship with the whole of reality</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">intelligence like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">and whether they actually have any</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">relationship to parts of the body</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">because of endocrine glands or nerves</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter to at least have it be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">metaphorical system</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:55.839" style="s2">um but the the will or the power there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:57.599" style="s2">a kind of intelligence to say what way</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">of me relating to this most</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.599" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">increases my capacity to serve what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">care about</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.119" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">right there&#39;s a kind of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">that&#39;s asking that that is different</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">than asking</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.440" style="s2">what is what am i able to falsify or</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">verify</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.440" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">about objective reality which is also</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.440" style="s2">different than the kind of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">of asking or hear how would i</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.440" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">communicate this in a way that would</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">land for someone and in order to have it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:22.560" style="s2">land for them i have to actually be them</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">right there&#39;s a kind of empathy built in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.560" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">that i have to be them to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">lend or try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">which is different than what is most</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">sacred to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">i think what we&#39;re what we&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">is how do we develop whole people that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">have all of their intelligences online</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">and all of them working together</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">analysis and synthesis logic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">and then that are in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">all of reality there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">race issues and environmental issues and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">economic issues there&#39;s reality issues</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">where all of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">inextricably interconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">interconnected to</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:58.079" style="s2">the being of all the other people and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">when we have increasingly whole people</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.079" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">an increasingly integris relationship</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">look at this topic from another angle i</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">am an anxious person and i have panic</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:13.040" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">so hearing a lot of language that i</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.040" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">think has developed from</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:19.440" style="s2">looking at things like triggered and</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">limbic states and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">makes me wonder will it be more</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">challenging</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">for me to learn these sorts of skills</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">or maybe will my familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">with things like panic attacks actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:36.800" style="s2">be helpful here</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">and you know what is going to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">way for people like me to approach this</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.880" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">beautiful question uh i used to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">panic attacks</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">um i had a period where that was quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">debilitating and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">didn&#39;t sleep for quite a long time and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">um so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">so i i understand um</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">early i had a completely debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">fear of public speaking where i just</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:04.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t like i would pass out if i</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:07.709" style="s2">tried</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.570" end="00:54:07.709" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.839" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.880" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">i only found one thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">that actually really worked for panic</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:24.400" style="s2">um and by worked i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:27.440" style="s2">actually changed the underlying reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.400" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">fundamentally as opposed to managed it</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.440" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">i didn&#39;t find that cbt did or dbt</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">or hitting pillows or emotional release</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">therapy or gestalt or hypnotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">like those were all cool but i or breath</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">work or meditation or</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">the only thing that i found worked was a</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.960" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">there are different ways of doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">they&#39;re ways that go into the panic</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">attack as opposed to away from it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll explain the mechanism here</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">briefly</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">a panic attack is different than just</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">generalized anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s generalized anxiety that</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">turns into a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:13.599" style="s2">and so let&#39;s say that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">anxious about some shit everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.599" end="00:55:16.799" style="s2">anxious like that fear is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">natural part of life and we&#39;ll feel some</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">adrenaline happen and we know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">in evolutionary environments the fear</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">usually needed a physiologic response so</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">some adrenaline would come so i could</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:27.760" style="s2">run or fight or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">now most of the things i&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.760" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t actually need adrenaline because</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">physical response to if the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">likes my</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.559" style="s2">um report or if the person on the date</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">wants to respond or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:42.640" style="s2">and as a result i don&#39;t use up that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">adrenaline there isn&#39;t a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.640" end="00:55:45.920" style="s2">adaptation it just feels shitty right</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.920" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">so maybe i&#39;m in a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:52.400" style="s2">i have a relationship that&#39;s going bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s going to work</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.400" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re being honest</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">to me and then finances are also tight</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">and something else i start to have</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">more base anxiety so my base anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">gets higher than us</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">and then maybe at a certain point</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">something happens and my base anxiety is</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">high enough that</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">the sensation of it inside of me the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">fluttering in my stomach or the like</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">hotness in my ears or in my face</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">all of a sudden is a sensation that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">unfamiliar with</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">like it&#39;s at a higher level and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">sudden i get scared of that sensation</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">because i&#39;m like what&#39;s happening am i</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">dying what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:27.599" style="s2">like am i going crazy what the fuck&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:27.920" style="s2">happening now when i get afraid of my</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.599" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.920" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">experience of fear now i&#39;m in a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">loop because i&#39;m not afraid of reality</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid of my own experience of fear</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">so my body produces adrenaline to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">symptoms of adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:43.040" style="s2">and that tight feedback loop is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.760" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">motherfucker because sometimes it&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.000" style="s2">to the symptoms of adrenaline so then</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:49.200" style="s2">the symptoms get worse so then you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.000" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">more scared and it does that until you</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.200" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">just run out of adrenaline and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">eventually pass out or you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">go get a benzo or an alcohol or</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">something</p>

<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">because i can</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:05.119" style="s2">take breaths and stimulate my</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">parasympathetic nervous system and in</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">our inverse to a sympathetic drive and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">if i try to distract myself with bunny</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">videos or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">i would do to try to create a different</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">response i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">affirming that i&#39;m scared of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">sensation</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">and that i don&#39;t want it to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">that if it comes i&#39;ll be scared of it so</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">my sympathetic adrenal complex is still</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">oriented to produce adrenaline to my</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.240" style="s2">symptoms of adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:32.000" style="s2">so i&#39;m always scared of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.240" end="00:57:34.319" style="s2">happening so</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">there are processes where you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.319" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">facilitated to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">into the panic attack fully and</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">so you start to think about things</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">you&#39;re anxious of you start to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">symptoms and then you start to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">it&#39;s important to know that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:49.119" style="s2">kill you even if you feel like you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:50.799" style="s2">breathe that worse you pass out the</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.119" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">panic attack is gone when your conscious</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.799" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">mind isn&#39;t there you start breathing</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:54.480" style="s2">again so you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">this is just sensations and as</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.480" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">uncomfortable as they are they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.839" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">actually hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">they&#39;re just fucked up feeling but</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:01.839" style="s2">sensations</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;re like ultimately i want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.839" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">understand myself i want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.520" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">what&#39;s arising enough that i can</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">actually be with myself and</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">and have more wholeness so then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:13.599" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">go into a process where you say all</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.599" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">and typically i would say this should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">facilitated and i can recommend</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">processes that do that so you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.799" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">process where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">you&#39;re being facilitated to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:30.640" style="s2">notice the symptoms the rapid heart the</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.359" end="00:58:32.480" style="s2">flushing face</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.640" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">and rather than want them to go away</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.480" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">welcome them</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">say i welcome all of this i want to feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:38.480" style="s2">it in fact i want to feel the fullness</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">of it i want to understand all of it and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.480" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">be with all of it so</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">not only do i want to feel it i want it</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">to get as intense as it can</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:47.280" style="s2">so you actually welcome it to let the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:48.839" style="s2">heart racing get more intense the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.280" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">difficulty breathing getting more</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.839" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">intense</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">and you can&#39;t say it while actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:55.920" style="s2">really wishing it goes away you have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:58.799" style="s2">really lean in as an explorer as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.920" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">curious explorer to be like what is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.799" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">when that happens there is a clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">signal to your adrenals that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">afraid of the thing you&#39;re leaning into</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">and it stops producing adrenaline in</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.040" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">response to the symptoms of adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">you&#39;re there is a kind of hpa access</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">neurological reset</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">psychological reset as well and</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.839" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">then once you&#39;ve done that several times</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">you start to be like</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:24.640" style="s2">actually i&#39;m not afraid of this thing i</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">can lean into it i&#39;m not going to die</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.640" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to go crazy i can</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">and and the feelings are actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">whatever right they&#39;re not that terrible</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.240" style="s2">and then the key becomes well you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:37.040" style="s2">afraid for it to come on at certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.240" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.040" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">like i okay i don&#39;t want it to come on</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:44.160" style="s2">when i&#39;m having to give my talk or</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">with my work or whatever it is so then</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.160" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">you actually have to welcome that it can</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">come</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">anytime because otherwise the time that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:50.720" style="s2">it isn&#39;t welcome is when you&#39;ll still be</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">in that response</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.720" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">and be like okay if it comes at that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:55.920" style="s2">time i&#39;ll be with it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll go into it i&#39;ll be with it because</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.920" end="00:59:58.839" style="s2">what the fuck else am i gonna do like i</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t really have much any other good</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.839" end="01:00:03.680" style="s2">choices</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:05.520" style="s2">and this is the process of leaning in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.680" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">and actually befriending the fear so</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.520" end="01:00:10.720" style="s2">fear stops being a self-reinforcing loop</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.799" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2">anyone who goes through that and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.720" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">actually goes through it</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">will have both a level of compassion and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:19.599" style="s2">plus a level of strength that is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">really available if people haven&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:22.000" style="s2">through it</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.799" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">any follow-up question hannah uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">many follow-up thoughts uh that i will</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">process slowly over time uh thank you</p>

<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:51.280" style="s2">and that they may even have a list of uh</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.280" end="01:00:59.359" style="s2">and this is a big part of stoicism of</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">wanting to really be with reality and</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.359" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">lean into it so contemplating death</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s not to just feel shitty all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.640" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">time it&#39;s that you actually stop</p>

<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:13.040" style="s2">away from parts of yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.079" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">one good way to talk about healing is</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">increasing wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">and the dis any the dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.400" style="s2">ways that some people interpret stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">are things that makes them actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">fragment</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">less whole they&#39;re ashamed of a part of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">themselves without knowing why that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">part&#39;s arising no i shouldn&#39;t feel angry</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">that and so as a result they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">stuffing shit into the shadows and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">they&#39;re becoming more fragmented and</p>

<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:18.240" style="s2">uh yeah hey everyone um</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">so the question is daniel i&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.240" end="01:02:23.119" style="s2">speak about how those with the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">depths of care often are not good at or</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.119" end="01:02:25.760" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">interested in impacting the world at</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.760" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">scale or sort of doing what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">to accumulate power could you paint a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">vision for how a wise empathic person</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:48.880" style="s2">might orient to accumulating power in</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.880" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">when i&#39;ll share how this</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">first occurred to me was when i was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:58.559" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:02.319" style="s2">i was engaged in part of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.039" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">homeschooling thing was i kind of got to</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.319" end="01:03:06.000" style="s2">do the things i was interested in i was</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:06.960" style="s2">interested in all types of activism so i</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.000" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">was doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.960" end="01:03:10.240" style="s2">animal rights stuff with peta and</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:11.359" style="s2">environmental stuff with greenpeace and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">human rights stuff at amnesty</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.359" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">international because it seemed like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">meaningful life was in service to all</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">other life was pretty straightforward as</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">i was trying to figure the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:22.480" style="s2">out that part seemed clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:23.839" style="s2">and so all of the different types of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.480" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">suffering bothered me</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.839" end="01:03:29.520" style="s2">and injustices and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">but i was also studying the sciences</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.520" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">because i wanted to understand reality</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">better and so i would have conversations</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">with scientists who would work at</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:40.880" style="s2">military industrial complex type places</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">and i would get a sense of the types of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.880" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">technology and sophistication they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:47.280" style="s2">working with</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:50.480" style="s2">but then advancing what types of agendas</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.280" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">and then be with the protesters who</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.480" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">were willing to undergo great harm to</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">themselves to stand up for what they</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:03:57.359" style="s2">cared about whether they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.440" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">handcuffing themselves to old redwood to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.359" end="01:04:00.640" style="s2">not have it cut down or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">but i got to see that like picket signs</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.640" end="01:04:03.680" style="s2">and handcuffs were the extent of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:06.559" style="s2">strategic capacity</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.680" end="01:04:08.720" style="s2">that they had compared to nsa being the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.559" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">largest employer of mathematicians and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.720" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">super computing technology and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:15.039" style="s2">and i was like</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">10 or something when i&#39;m like this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.039" end="01:04:18.640" style="s2">the head heart divide at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">humanity and we go extinct as long</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.640" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">as those who care the most have shitty</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">tools for</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">actuation and those who have the best</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">tools for actuation are doing it for</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">narrow and divisive</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:31.520" style="s2">ends and then a little bit later i</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">started to think of it as at least three</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.520" end="01:04:36.640" style="s2">things that it was kind of mind heart</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">will and that any two of them</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.640" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t really matter that there was the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">development of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:45.039" style="s2">will and i feel like i can do something</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:45.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m willing to work hard to do it</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:49.599" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.839" end="01:04:52.960" style="s2">uh values or care or compassion together</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.599" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">that led to an activist who really cared</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.960" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">about stuff and was totally willing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">work effectively but didn&#39;t have good</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">strategy and would just basically fail</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">at scale every time</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">then there were people who had</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">development of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">mind and heart more but with less well</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">where they felt like they understood the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">problems they really cared but they were</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:12.799" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:14.400" style="s2">overwhelmed crippled academics or at</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.799" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">best could be advisors to</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.400" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">powerful people that would never</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:20.799" style="s2">actually take their advice</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:22.720" style="s2">um and then there was kind of will in</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.799" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">mind together but without development of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.720" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">compassion and virtue</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.000" end="01:05:28.240" style="s2">and those were the very effective</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">sociopathically oriented people that ran</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.240" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.160" style="s2">and it was clear to me that you had to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:36.240" style="s2">have at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:38.000" style="s2">all three of those well-developed plus</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.240" end="01:05:39.200" style="s2">the interpersonal capacity to find other</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.000" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">people that had those developed and</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.200" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">coordinate together</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:44.240" style="s2">to really be able to change the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">trajectory of the world</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.240" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">and so this comes down to this whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:50.960" style="s2">thing of</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:52.160" style="s2">not being willing to suck at being in</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.960" end="01:05:55.280" style="s2">service to</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.160" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">what i care about if i really</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.280" end="01:05:59.839" style="s2">if i see the amazon burning or north</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:01.280" style="s2">northern california burning and i see</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">the redwoods burning and that really</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.280" end="01:06:06.160" style="s2">bothers me</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:07.280" style="s2">and i am willing to continue to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.160" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">useless</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.280" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">towards it then i have to be like does</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.920" end="01:06:13.280" style="s2">it really bother me do i really care</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">what is the fragmentation inside of</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:16.480" style="s2">myself what does my care mean if it</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t predispose my</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.480" end="01:06:20.240" style="s2">the behavior of my life what is my life</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:22.240" style="s2">in service to if not what i care about</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.240" end="01:06:23.760" style="s2">oh distraction or money or whatever else</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.240" end="01:06:25.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t actually even care about what i</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">care about i&#39;m just full of shit</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.839" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the internal fragmentation</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.440" end="01:06:30.319" style="s2">what does it mean to care about what i</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">care about it means that</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.319" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">my dollars and minutes will express what</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:38.319" style="s2">i care about</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:39.920" style="s2">then i&#39;m acting on it but i keep failing</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.319" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">well then i need to look at my strategy</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.920" end="01:06:44.400" style="s2">and say why do i keep failing</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">and unfortunately a lot of times people</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.400" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">work hard fail and just assess</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:52.160" style="s2">that goliath is too big or there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">enough people helping</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:57.200" style="s2">or whatever and are happy to come up</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:06:58.960" style="s2">with excuses why they aren&#39;t effective</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.200" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">rather than really say what would it</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.960" end="01:07:04.480" style="s2">take to be effective</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">because neither the ccp</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.480" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">nor the cia nor the kremlin just give up</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:09.680" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">oh i guess we&#39;re not effective the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">guys are bigger they like keep figuring</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">out how to be more effective</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:18.160" style="s2">towards their ends and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:19.920" style="s2">and they can move trillions of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.160" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">in standing armies in the mindsets of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.920" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:26.240" style="s2">and technology as a whole if we want a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:28.799" style="s2">better world we have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.240" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">affect the world at that level aligned</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.799" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">with a different value system</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">so what i would say is we aren&#39;t in like</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:38.880" style="s2">game b isn&#39;t a thing really yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">that most kind of an idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.880" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">we live in a world that is dominated by</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:47.359" style="s2">and the transition from this world to a</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:48.880" style="s2">different kind of world system that</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.359" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">might have a very different culture and</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.880" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:53.839" style="s2">is only going to happen if some people</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.839" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">are authentically oriented to a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">different world system learn how to</p>

<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:09.680" style="s2">past time so you could</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">either not answer this or be brief with</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.680" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">it i think a follow-on question</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:16.319" style="s2">that occurs to me as i i read your piece</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:19.359" style="s2">about the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.319" end="01:08:21.520" style="s2">the polymath bodhisattva world creator</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.359" end="01:08:24.799" style="s2">as sort of archetypes that represent</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.520" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">mind heart will um</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.799" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">and i feel like i have a sense of sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:32.159" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:34.640" style="s2">characters or developmental pathways</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">that correspond with becoming a polymath</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:37.920" style="s2">becoming a bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.159" end="01:08:39.679" style="s2">but i think what&#39;s less clear and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.920" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">kind of relevant to this question is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">this notion of the archetype of a world</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:44.560" style="s2">creator</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:47.120" style="s2">what what does that mean and what kinds</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.560" end="01:08:48.960" style="s2">of developmental pathways or traditions</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.120" end="01:08:51.199" style="s2">are relevant to that</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.960" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">so look at people who were not born into</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.199" end="01:08:55.279" style="s2">great wealth or power</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:57.199" style="s2">and became very powerful and study</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.279" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">their biographies specifically the</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.199" end="01:09:00.799" style="s2">biographies of their psychology and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:02.080" style="s2">steps they took</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.799" end="01:09:04.080" style="s2">and what will be interesting is you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">be studying genghis khan and alexander</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.080" end="01:09:07.279" style="s2">the great</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:08.319" style="s2">napoleon and carnegie and elon musk and</p>

<p begin="01:09:08.319" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">and you&#39;ll be like how the fuck would i</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.319" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">apply some of those actually kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:16.400" style="s2">dreadful game theoretic</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">tactics to something better but</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.400" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">that&#39;s just a kind of a very superficial</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:23.520" style="s2">assessment as you go deeper you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:25.120" style="s2">how did they empower themselves not</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.520" end="01:09:26.960" style="s2">coming from it what were the things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">did that and what would it look like to</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.960" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">be able to do that towards a different</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:33.279" style="s2">set of goals</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:34.799" style="s2">um there&#39;s a whole big conversation here</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.279" end="01:09:37.679" style="s2">but uh</p>

<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:48.960" style="s2">commonalities</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:52.319" style="s2">of what is involved in increasing agency</p>
