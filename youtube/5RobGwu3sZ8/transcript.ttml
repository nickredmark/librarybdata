<p begin="00:00:04.500" end="00:00:13.620" style="s2">I&#39;ve been doing my own inner stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.290" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">the thing that inspired this video was</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.620" end="00:00:16.470" style="s2">just being back at my house for a time</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:19.619" style="s2">being before coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">community I&#39;m living in until tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.619" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">when they&#39;re pretend ace and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">volatile for six years I was the only</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">one who wasn&#39;t able to move into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">community that&#39;s still a part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:35.370" style="s2">we still participate and there was this</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">constant fear inside of me of like being</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.370" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">kicked out being ostracized for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:41.610" style="s2">reason especially if I got into conflict</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:44.040" style="s2">with somebody who was in the community</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.610" end="00:00:48.020" style="s2">because they own or rent their houses</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.040" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">and I just visit a few times a week and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.020" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">I realized over a year ago but that man</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:55.110" style="s2">time wasn&#39;t showing up completely myself</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">it was like oh what if I offend someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.110" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">or what if some doesn&#39;t like me or what</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.579" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">if someone doesn&#39;t I know every area of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">my life is I do that in and the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">conscious of it the more I can let it go</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">and not do that and it&#39;s an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">process I don&#39;t think I was ever gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">be it full out not care at all what</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">people think or I don&#39;t even know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">you&#39;d get there and I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">project this big world project and like</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">everyone&#39;s loved and every like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:24.259" style="s2">needs love and everyone&#39;s deserving of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:26.790" style="s2">that and community and connection and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.259" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">ostracize for what a bad word is</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.790" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">ostracize someone you kick them out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">your community when you put people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">salt it&#39;s like one of the worst pains</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">you can inflict on a human and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">even I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:47.130" style="s2">ever the answer but what do you do when</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:49.950" style="s2">if someone doesn&#39;t want to someone&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.130" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">a community and they want to cause pain</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.950" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">they want to cause drama and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">necessarily think that&#39;s what was</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:57.479" style="s2">happening here</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">it was my interpretation for a day after</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.479" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">the event for sure less than 48 hours</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:07.610" style="s2">later I feel like okay it&#39;s whatever 48</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">plus to 66 hours later to return to love</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.610" end="00:02:11.849" style="s2">so I&#39;m pretty impressed with myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:13.710" style="s2">because it was a anyway this event</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.849" end="00:02:15.450" style="s2">triggered that like it was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.710" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">oh I can get kicked like I got into</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.450" end="00:02:20.820" style="s2">conflict with somebody and instead of my</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:22.530" style="s2">fear being realized of like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.820" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">gonna it did trigger that for sure like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.530" end="00:02:25.950" style="s2">the actual emotion I&#39;m like nobody likes</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">me and nobody wants me here because that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.950" end="00:02:32.310" style="s2">was more or less said to me um I think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:33.600" style="s2">have social anxiety of all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">negative thoughts that go through your</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.600" end="00:02:36.420" style="s2">head like here&#39;s what people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:39.210" style="s2">thinking about me and I&#39;m just like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.420" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">not your business overall but like in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.210" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">this moment I was like oh this is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:44.760" style="s2">it never actually comes out of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:47.160" style="s2">mouths like what you think people think</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.760" end="00:02:48.840" style="s2">about you it did it takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.160" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">people smells this woman told me that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.840" end="00:02:54.930" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t have a disability and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:57.090" style="s2">was faking it and that I was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:58.980" style="s2">freeloader and not not pulling my weight</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.090" end="00:03:00.300" style="s2">like beyond that like and then I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.980" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">welcome here and I need to leave and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">ever come back and a little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">anger a bit more from a place of law it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">was like you know like I&#39;m as big a part</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:10.770" style="s2">of this community as you are like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">might own your house and we might not</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.770" end="00:03:14.060" style="s2">but like I don&#39;t know if that matters I</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:16.230" style="s2">think especially is that some little</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.060" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">anti-capitalist and a piece of you did</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.230" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">think that mattered and now I&#39;m like no</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t matter so this woman in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">real way gave me this big blessing both</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:27.690" style="s2">because I get to kill that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:30.630" style="s2">myself that was like I mean I I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.690" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">honest about my my conditions overly so</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.630" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">and part of that honesty is that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">know how much of it is is physical and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:41.130" style="s2">how much of it is mental and even the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">mental part I don&#39;t know how much of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.130" end="00:03:44.820" style="s2">is physical how much of it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:47.250" style="s2">from neurological damage and how much of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.820" end="00:03:49.080" style="s2">it is from like thought processes that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.250" end="00:03:50.490" style="s2">could change like like stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.080" end="00:03:52.740" style="s2">could have control over and stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.490" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">could change or stuff that doesn&#39;t and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.740" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">realize it&#39;s not really my job to figure</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">it out especially with my health it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">more about learning from it and</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:14.100" style="s2">possibility it was really horrible news</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.490" end="00:04:15.930" style="s2">and it was nothing and that used to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.100" end="00:04:17.580" style="s2">trigger me almost more because it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.930" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">like oh this is like a fake and it&#39;s</p>
