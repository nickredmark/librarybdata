<p begin="00:02:35.329" end="00:02:41.000" style="s2">to stay because it&#39;s gonna be good so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.989" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">let&#39;s do a quick introduction to tie</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.000" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">everything back together to what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:46.340" style="s2">theme of this weekly session is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:47.540" style="s2">I know there&#39;s some new faces here first</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.340" end="00:02:48.560" style="s2">of all what is a mastermind you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.540" end="00:02:50.359" style="s2">we&#39;re calling this the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.560" end="00:02:51.739" style="s2">mastermind a lot of you may have heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.359" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">this term I think it goes back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.739" end="00:02:55.340" style="s2">pulling Hill it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:57.230" style="s2">self-help term a friendly alliance with</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.340" end="00:02:59.540" style="s2">one or more persons who will encourage</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.230" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">one to follow through with both plan and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.540" end="00:03:03.620" style="s2">purpose so it&#39;s basically an</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:06.049" style="s2">accountability group right when people</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.620" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">care whether or not you show up or care</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.049" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">whether or not you are doing the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">you say you will do the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:12.950" style="s2">you will do those things goes up and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:14.030" style="s2">if you have a little tried like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:16.519" style="s2">that&#39;s holding you together that</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.030" end="00:03:19.159" style="s2">actually helps raise your sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.519" end="00:03:20.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s the mastermind we have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.159" end="00:03:24.470" style="s2">different slightly different take on</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.359" end="00:03:25.939" style="s2">this but you&#39;ll see as I share more how</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.470" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">it fits into what we&#39;re doing tonight</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.939" end="00:03:30.769" style="s2">tonight is this weekly Saturday session</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:32.030" style="s2">called the metagame mastermind where we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.769" end="00:03:34.120" style="s2">explore a bunch of different topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.030" end="00:03:36.199" style="s2">related to masterminding related to</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.120" end="00:03:38.060" style="s2">everything really that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.199" end="00:03:40.099" style="s2">relationships and developing sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.060" end="00:03:43.459" style="s2">and our response to reality so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.099" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">quite a broad topic and that is a weekly</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.459" end="00:03:46.220" style="s2">event that occurs in the stoah which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">a series of you know a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.220" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">different weekly events and ad-hoc</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">events what you don&#39;t see here and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:55.159" style="s2">you won&#39;t see in the stoah are all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.859" style="s2">triads groups of three that have spun</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.159" end="00:03:59.150" style="s2">off of these Saturday sessions and these</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.859" end="00:04:00.680" style="s2">are little mastermind groups and I like</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.150" end="00:04:01.609" style="s2">calling them digital gangs because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.680" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">of these people are in different time</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.609" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">zones and they&#39;re just meeting only on</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.879" style="s2">zoom&#39; because of the pandemic and these</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:09.260" style="s2">are three sometimes there&#39;s four people</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.879" end="00:04:11.299" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s two people but generally</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">they&#39;re three person groups many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.299" end="00:04:14.750" style="s2">which are in this room right now that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:17.389" style="s2">are doing this whole accountability</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.070" style="s2">thing so that&#39;s just some context for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.389" end="00:04:20.539" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.070" end="00:04:21.979" style="s2">interested in this I will share my email</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.539" end="00:04:24.470" style="s2">at the end and I can give you guys a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.979" end="00:04:27.380" style="s2">chance to sign up for one of those</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.470" end="00:04:30.199" style="s2">triads so that&#39;s a mastermind what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.380" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">what is the metagame this is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.199" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">really elusive concept that has some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:36.680" style="s2">buzz and you see it a lot in Twitter but</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:38.599" style="s2">here&#39;s a definition I really like</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.680" end="00:04:40.909" style="s2">playing the meta game helps us discover</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.599" end="00:04:42.040" style="s2">the right relationship with the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.909" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">of games we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.040" end="00:04:46.510" style="s2">currently playing so it&#39;s basically an</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:49.060" style="s2">analogy to think about life as a series</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.510" end="00:04:50.740" style="s2">of games and then to occupy the position</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.060" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">where you have the most sovereignty over</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.740" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">all those games and then you can reflect</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:57.100" style="s2">on do I want to be a part of this game</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">do I want to opt out of this one you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.100" end="00:05:00.760" style="s2">want to play that game that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">playing right now or how do I play this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.760" end="00:05:03.700" style="s2">game better because I&#39;m realizing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:06.220" style="s2">one of the more important games so at</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.700" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">the very least that&#39;s the meta game it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.220" end="00:05:10.390" style="s2">a position of reflection on all the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:12.520" style="s2">other games but it&#39;s more than that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.390" end="00:05:14.170" style="s2">which we&#39;ll come back to in other</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.520" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">sessions but for the sake of tonight</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.170" end="00:05:18.580" style="s2">this that&#39;s the definition of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:21.580" style="s2">game and some of these games that might</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.580" end="00:05:23.590" style="s2">come in with the mastermind are games</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.580" end="00:05:26.050" style="s2">having to do with like your finances or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.590" end="00:05:27.430" style="s2">your career or romance or you know all</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.050" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">these things buzzwords that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.430" end="00:05:29.920" style="s2">written here all these different games</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.570" end="00:05:32.860" style="s2">that a mastermind group can actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.920" end="00:05:34.870" style="s2">help you play better now this is a set</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.860" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">up for tonight the game that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.870" end="00:05:40.830" style="s2">to focus on is authentic relating which</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:43.150" style="s2">in itself is kind of meta because</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.830" end="00:05:46.510" style="s2">authentic relating for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.150" end="00:05:47.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s a term that it has now</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.510" end="00:05:49.960" style="s2">become something of a movement that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.920" end="00:05:51.880" style="s2">kind of specific instantiations that</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.960" end="00:05:53.740" style="s2">refer to the process of relating to each</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.880" end="00:05:55.510" style="s2">other more authentically it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.740" end="00:05:57.850" style="s2">can just take it at at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.510" end="00:06:00.730" style="s2">name and relating to each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.850" end="00:06:04.570" style="s2">authentically is necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.730" end="00:06:05.710" style="s2">successful mastermind groups if you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.570" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">want to hold each other accountable you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.710" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">need some level of authenticity but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">you want to play the metagame mastermind</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:14.260" style="s2">then you up regulate your authenticity a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:16.420" style="s2">little bit and why why am I saying why</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.260" end="00:06:18.460" style="s2">is this important oh and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.420" end="00:06:19.810" style="s2">most important part basically this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.460" end="00:06:20.170" style="s2">getting into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.810" end="00:06:22.210" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.170" end="00:06:25.000" style="s2">antek relating is a practice for doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.210" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">that I put this image here I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.000" end="00:06:28.330" style="s2">sure many of you have seen this this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.260" style="s2">a piece of art from one of the burning</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.330" end="00:06:32.710" style="s2">man&#39;s a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.260" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">which shows I think something that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.710" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">of us often feel right where for</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.560" end="00:06:39.820" style="s2">whatever reason may be in authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.020" end="00:06:41.350" style="s2">the inner child or the more authentic</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.820" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">parts of ourselves have difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.350" end="00:06:45.970" style="s2">reaching the authentic parts of others</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:48.370" style="s2">and you might be wondering why any of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.970" end="00:06:49.630" style="s2">this matters right well this isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.370" end="00:06:51.400" style="s2">about accountability like why are we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.630" end="00:06:53.260" style="s2">talking about authentic relating but why</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.400" end="00:06:55.930" style="s2">are we talking about our feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.260" end="00:06:57.970" style="s2">authenticity well the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.930" end="00:06:59.740" style="s2">because as this incredible person once</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.970" end="00:07:00.759" style="s2">said the meaning of life is friends and</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.740" end="00:07:01.509" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve been thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.759" end="00:07:06.850" style="s2">lot about lately</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.509" end="00:07:08.199" style="s2">until I treated this very recently the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.850" end="00:07:13.810" style="s2">meaning of life is not accountability</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.199" end="00:07:17.320" style="s2">groups the meaning of life is not your</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.810" end="00:07:18.490" style="s2">career it&#39;s not and maybe this is my</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.320" end="00:07:20.770" style="s2">opinion but I&#39;m just gonna go with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.490" end="00:07:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not cultivating personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.770" end="00:07:25.150" style="s2">sovereignty I mean those are good things</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.960" end="00:07:26.410" style="s2">but if we make that the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.150" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">there&#39;s something kind of perverted</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.410" end="00:07:32.919" style="s2">about it why would we cultivate personal</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">sovereignty if if we&#39;re in a relational</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.919" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">vacuum and the more and more I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:39.130" style="s2">about this more I realize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">ultimately none of this makes sense if</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.130" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">there&#39;s no friendship if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:45.639" style="s2">relation if there&#39;s no other and I want</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:49.720" style="s2">to take us down that path more and more</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.639" end="00:07:52.210" style="s2">tonight so one of the things that stops</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.720" end="00:07:53.410" style="s2">us from actually one realizing that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.210" end="00:07:56.139" style="s2">meaning of life is friends and feel free</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.410" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">to disagree with me on this but if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.139" end="00:07:59.380" style="s2">play with this for a second you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:01.270" style="s2">realize that we we don&#39;t always think</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.380" end="00:08:02.740" style="s2">like this you know we often make</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.270" end="00:08:04.330" style="s2">decisions at the expense of our</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.740" end="00:08:06.729" style="s2">friendships in service of other things</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.330" end="00:08:08.440" style="s2">that supposedly are more meaningful than</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.729" end="00:08:10.449" style="s2">our friendships than our relationships</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.440" end="00:08:12.310" style="s2">one of the things that keeps coming up</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.449" end="00:08:13.990" style="s2">that gets in the way of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.310" end="00:08:14.889" style="s2">friendship authentic relating is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.990" end="00:08:17.979" style="s2">something called impression management</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.889" end="00:08:19.810" style="s2">which we talked about two weeks ago and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.979" end="00:08:21.520" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna riff on this a few I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.810" end="00:08:23.229" style="s2">in in coming weeks as well and basically</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.520" end="00:08:25.000" style="s2">this is a conscious or unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.229" end="00:08:26.620" style="s2">process in which we attempt to influence</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.000" end="00:08:29.380" style="s2">the perceptions of the other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.620" end="00:08:31.210" style="s2">around us about ourselves it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.380" end="00:08:32.289" style="s2">you kind of hold back information and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.210" end="00:08:33.669" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to make yourself seem</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.289" end="00:08:35.320" style="s2">cooler than you are or you try to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.669" end="00:08:39.130" style="s2">yourself seem more powerful than you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.320" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">or whatever and it can be conscious we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.130" end="00:08:41.860" style="s2">can be morally agnostic about it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">sometimes impression management might</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.860" end="00:08:46.450" style="s2">actually be useful but unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">oftentimes it&#39;s unconscious and our</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.450" end="00:08:50.790" style="s2">impressions create this persona that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.940" end="00:08:53.829" style="s2">stand in the way of authentic relating</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.790" end="00:08:55.540" style="s2">so we&#39;ve explored in the past some ways</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.829" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">to break through this and tonight we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.540" end="00:09:00.750" style="s2">gonna explore another one and again I</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:03.160" style="s2">want to remind us of at the goal right</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.750" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2">underneath the idea of the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.160" end="00:09:07.329" style="s2">life being friends is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.589" end="00:09:09.269" style="s2">ultimately we were seeking connection or</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.329" end="00:09:10.499" style="s2">connectedness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.269" end="00:09:12.749" style="s2">I&#39;m sure many of you are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.499" end="00:09:14.759" style="s2">Bernie Brown and I love this quote in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.749" end="00:09:16.740" style="s2">order for connection to happen we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.759" end="00:09:19.619" style="s2">to allow ourselves to be seen an</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.740" end="00:09:22.410" style="s2">impression management is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.619" end="00:09:23.639" style="s2">throttling that potential to be seen</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.410" end="00:09:25.499" style="s2">when you&#39;re putting something else</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.639" end="00:09:28.350" style="s2">you&#39;re introducing your own agenda in</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.499" end="00:09:31.170" style="s2">the way of that and again this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.350" end="00:09:32.279" style="s2">necessarily bad but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.170" end="00:09:35.069" style="s2">unfortunate when it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.279" end="00:09:36.869" style="s2">unconsciously so this is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.069" end="00:09:38.129" style="s2">gonna lean into in this breakout session</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.869" end="00:09:39.779" style="s2">and if you&#39;re feeling a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.129" end="00:09:42.600" style="s2">nervous about it that&#39;s probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.779" end="00:09:44.249" style="s2">sign because this this is you know gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.600" end="00:09:47.129" style="s2">be a little bit awkward it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.249" end="00:09:49.170" style="s2">noticing game and I&#39;m going to explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.129" end="00:09:51.149" style="s2">the rules and then I&#39;m gonna demo it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.170" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">then I&#39;ll give everyone a chance to ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.149" end="00:09:55.470" style="s2">some questions so the structure is super</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:09:57.240" style="s2">super simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.470" end="00:09:58.889" style="s2">it&#39;s two people in the zoom room one</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.240" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">person is person a the others person B</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.889" end="00:10:02.610" style="s2">you can go alphabetically and person a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:04.679" style="s2">goes first and says what I noticed when</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.610" end="00:10:07.619" style="s2">I&#39;m with you is and then they fill in</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.679" end="00:10:09.509" style="s2">the blank and then person B says hearing</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.619" end="00:10:12.089" style="s2">that what I&#39;m noticing is and then they</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.509" end="00:10:14.040" style="s2">fill in the blank and you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.089" end="00:10:18.329" style="s2">forth and you do this for five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.040" end="00:10:21.179" style="s2">and the idea is that you only say things</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.329" end="00:10:23.339" style="s2">that you are noticing this creates</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.179" end="00:10:26.040" style="s2">something like a conversational</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.339" end="00:10:27.209" style="s2">meditation where I say something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.040" end="00:10:28.589" style="s2">I&#39;m noticing you say something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.209" end="00:10:30.809" style="s2">you&#39;re noticing and then we both are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.589" end="00:10:32.819" style="s2">attending to only things that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.809" end="00:10:34.799" style="s2">happening right now and that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.819" end="00:10:36.540" style="s2">peel back impression management to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.799" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">extent it&#39;s definitely still gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.540" end="00:10:39.389" style="s2">there and to some extent it should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:40.529" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re gonna meet some</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.389" end="00:10:42.929" style="s2">stranger&#39;s and you want to keep yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.529" end="00:10:44.910" style="s2">somewhat guarded but it also opens up</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.929" end="00:10:46.679" style="s2">the door to actually be seen and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.910" end="00:10:49.769" style="s2">opens up the door to relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.679" end="00:10:50.879" style="s2">other more authentically some of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.769" end="00:10:52.829" style="s2">things you can say some of the things</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.879" end="00:10:55.230" style="s2">you can notice you can notice the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.829" end="00:10:56.549" style="s2">person&#39;s physical appearance when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.230" end="00:10:58.559" style="s2">with you I noticed that you seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.549" end="00:11:00.360" style="s2">looking away a lot sensations in your</p>
