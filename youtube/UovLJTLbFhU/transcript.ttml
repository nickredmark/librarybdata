<p begin="00:00:01.220" end="00:00:07.859" style="s2">I was talking with Zack Stein just a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.150" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">moments ago about this call and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.859" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">mentioned that I felt a certain sense of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:16.650" style="s2">butterflies in my stomach and as I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:17.010" style="s2">kind of feeling what what the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.650" end="00:00:18.510" style="s2">the Musk</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.010" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">oh yes this is the feeling that I had</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.510" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">and still have for sporting event</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">perform engaging and an athletic</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:27.119" style="s2">remember like the butterflies in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:29.269" style="s2">stomach a sense of anticipation and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.119" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">nervousness but but nervous it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.269" end="00:00:34.380" style="s2">well you guys get it you get the quality</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:38.040" style="s2">of good yeah in that trepidation but</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.380" end="00:00:41.090" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of energizing anticipation</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.040" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re describing yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.090" end="00:00:45.680" style="s2">and I get that if that wasn&#39;t father</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">into sports</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.680" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">actually well both but but I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">thinking about that I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">that before the call to actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">interesting to hear you say that because</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">I had a similar feeling and you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:57.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not trepidatious but it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:00:59.940" style="s2">anticipate ory and I think it has</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.539" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">something to do with the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.940" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">conversations have already shown that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">they because they have the transmuting</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:09.210" style="s2">quality such that at the end of it we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">cannot have anticipated where we&#39;ll land</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.210" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">at the beginning and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">something about that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">about that I think that provokes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">anticipation because I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know who I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">going to be on the other end of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">call on the other side of it I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">that has something to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">anticipation mm-hmm yeah I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">something deeply aspirational about</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.280" style="s2">these conversations enough in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">you describe Chris if we the you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.280" end="00:01:36.020" style="s2">Agnes colored since we don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be and what values and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.020" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">perspectives we might come to inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:41.909" style="s2">from where we are right now we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">foresee them in an inferential manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.909" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">which I think it&#39;s one of the well one</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">of sort of the sacred elements of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">kind of practice it&#39;s an aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:55.110" style="s2">component so there&#39;s momentous that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">is a momentous occasion because it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.110" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">implies both a there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:03.899" style="s2">that will result and that result has</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">potency it as consequence and then to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.899" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">move through it also implies</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">skillfulness yeah butterflies perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">energy coming up saying get your shit in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">gear</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">it is time to play because this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">you&#39;re playing for marbles here this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:20.069" style="s2">for real this is going to happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:21.659" style="s2">going to push you and the more you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.069" end="00:02:23.189" style="s2">able to bring yourself to bear and push</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.659" end="00:02:27.060" style="s2">yourself and the others to the limit the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.189" end="00:02:29.189" style="s2">more change actually occurs so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.060" end="00:02:30.599" style="s2">what&#39;s really kind of compelling about</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.189" end="00:02:34.049" style="s2">what the way that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.599" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">them noticing is is that yes I have this</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.049" end="00:02:38.189" style="s2">anticipation in these butterflies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">come up right in the face of something</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.189" end="00:02:44.280" style="s2">in the future and I&#39;m precisely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely because I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.280" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">to anticipate right that gives the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:52.079" style="s2">character of anticipation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">just a really interesting thing about in</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.079" end="00:02:56.489" style="s2">a certain sense I think about it I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:02:58.379" style="s2">wonder if we could think I actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.489" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">wonder if we can think about the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.379" end="00:03:06.329" style="s2">of the future as a call right and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:08.849" style="s2">think yeah I think so because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.329" end="00:03:10.799" style="s2">think it&#39;s just the butterflies the a</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.849" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">ploy that we&#39;re considering undertaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.799" end="00:03:19.439" style="s2">here the great feats right I don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:22.259" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a not knowing but</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.439" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">there&#39;s also I mentioned this before for</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.259" end="00:03:27.769" style="s2">me yeah I&#39;m getting that sense that far</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">right but there&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.769" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">enables my commitment to the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:33.930" style="s2">which is I&#39;ve developed I&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:35.759" style="s2">also a sense of trust which is not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.930" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">same as knowing I&#39;m trusting in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.759" end="00:03:39.329" style="s2">process and I thought I think and Chris</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">and I were talking about this last night</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.329" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">because we&#39;re working on this chapter</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">about dialectic and I was I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:48.780" style="s2">to get at I&#39;m reading a book by Molina</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s talking about sort of the Plato</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.780" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">views dialogue it&#39;s this process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">trying to get at what what&#39;s the what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:56.459" style="s2">would call it as a grammar out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:03:58.859" style="s2">discipline discourse what do we need and</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.459" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">one of the things one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.859" end="00:04:02.430" style="s2">think we need is we need a move which</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">sort of is fundamental to rationality</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.430" end="00:04:08.219" style="s2">which is an ability to trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:10.219" style="s2">process without having a predetermined</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.219" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">prejudicial commitment to the product</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.219" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">standard stalks about this as being a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">crucial component of rationality and oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">I know when although we&#39;re not entering</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">into you know an argument towards a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:22.529" style="s2">conclusion I think we&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">inactive kind of rationality because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.529" end="00:04:25.360" style="s2">are training each other in the ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">to trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.360" end="00:04:29.979" style="s2">process and I&#39;m interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:33.400" style="s2">affords that trust what is it about what</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.979" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that makes us trust it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.400" end="00:04:36.909" style="s2">this goes back to the issue that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:38.259" style="s2">conversation we had before about our</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.909" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">vulnerability and there is there some</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.259" end="00:04:42.370" style="s2">way in which the world is vulnerable or</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:44.020" style="s2">a being is vulnerable to like is there a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.370" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">is there a is there something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.020" end="00:04:47.979" style="s2">engenders our trust in this process the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:49.150" style="s2">process is certainly has vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.979" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">to it that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.150" end="00:04:53.439" style="s2">thinking about we have to care for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:55.270" style="s2">process it&#39;s vulnerable and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.439" end="00:04:58.270" style="s2">mutual there&#39;s a mutual relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.270" end="00:05:00.159" style="s2">between my disclosing my vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.270" end="00:05:01.449" style="s2">and the processes disclosing its</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.159" end="00:05:03.129" style="s2">vulnerability I don&#39;t know about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.449" end="00:05:06.939" style="s2">world yet but at least I know that about</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.129" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">the process and then that that&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.939" end="00:05:10.449" style="s2">is one of the things that&#39;s engendering</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:14.889" style="s2">a kind of love and then that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.449" end="00:05:18.219" style="s2">engendering a kind of trust and so I the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.889" end="00:05:20.289" style="s2">butterflies for me are there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.219" end="00:05:22.509" style="s2">they&#39;re not the butterflies of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.289" end="00:05:24.759" style="s2">trepidation they&#39;re there like when</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.509" end="00:05:26.889" style="s2">Bilbo climbs above the trees and</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.759" end="00:05:28.900" style="s2">Mirkwood and he sees the butterflies</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.889" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">take flight and they give him a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.900" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">trust in the journey that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.029" style="s2">undertaken because they give him a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.110" end="00:05:36.699" style="s2">moment of love they give him a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.029" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">realization and so I&#39;m very interested</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.699" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">in about how these two come together if</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:43.240" style="s2">John is this similar I just want to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">sure because to bring in a thread that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.240" end="00:05:46.349" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.740" end="00:05:50.050" style="s2">talked about in the last conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.349" end="00:05:54.219" style="s2">when you talk when you speak of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.050" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">divine double you basically in one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.219" end="00:05:59.529" style="s2">the interesting things about the divine</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:02.500" style="s2">double is that it it it precisely isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.529" end="00:06:05.620" style="s2">what you are yet yet it&#39;s it yet is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.500" end="00:06:08.229" style="s2">granting the normativity in which you</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.620" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">are and I&#39;m working about I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.229" end="00:06:14.589" style="s2">about the is that is is it that sense as</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:18.759" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s like that sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.589" end="00:06:23.650" style="s2">should be on the horizon right that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.759" end="00:06:25.300" style="s2">that that has us um have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.650" end="00:06:26.259" style="s2">normativity that we&#39;re having in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.300" end="00:06:29.979" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.259" end="00:06:32.199" style="s2">that makes it a sense of makes it worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.979" end="00:06:34.089" style="s2">being vulnerable for right again</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.199" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">engendering that sense the vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.089" end="00:06:39.040" style="s2">as a you know as distinct from something</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:42.040" style="s2">like exposure yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.040" end="00:06:43.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a courageous um in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.040" end="00:06:46.990" style="s2">sense a willingness to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.980" end="00:06:48.580" style="s2">something known or comfortable right</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.990" end="00:06:50.890" style="s2">because something&#39;s worth it</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.580" end="00:06:53.350" style="s2">and that connect into what&#39;s just beyond</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.890" end="00:06:56.050" style="s2">the horizon and it feels to me very much</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.350" end="00:06:57.790" style="s2">what distinguishes the cadence of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.050" end="00:07:02.590" style="s2">conversation and perhaps what calls us</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.790" end="00:07:05.830" style="s2">together is that that what were that</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.590" end="00:07:08.470" style="s2">that we&#39;re constantly looking towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.830" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">what it is that&#39;s emerging in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.470" end="00:07:15.070" style="s2">conversation right as we&#39;re conversing</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:18.010" style="s2">pray as we&#39;re conversing so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.070" end="00:07:20.440" style="s2">just like we&#39;re know something and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.010" end="00:07:23.620" style="s2">record it it&#39;s more like we&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.440" end="00:07:26.410" style="s2">and that and that what we end up talking</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.620" end="00:07:29.260" style="s2">about is something that isn&#39;t produced</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.410" end="00:07:31.000" style="s2">by us but emerges and is calling to us</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.260" end="00:07:34.420" style="s2">in a way that we couldn&#39;t have known in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.000" end="00:07:38.020" style="s2">advance mm-hmm I think all of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.420" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">correct I&#39;ll try and respond as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.020" end="00:07:43.960" style="s2">as possible so other people can jump in</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:45.460" style="s2">I think that that the engendering of</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.960" end="00:07:47.080" style="s2">trust is precisely one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.460" end="00:07:51.600" style="s2">that distinguishes vulnerability from</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.080" end="00:07:53.590" style="s2">exposure and I think the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.600" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">relationship like you said we have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.590" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">the divine double that is coming the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.640" end="00:08:04.660" style="s2">the way in which we are being called</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.290" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">beyond ourselves because we&#39;re trusting</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.660" end="00:08:08.620" style="s2">in the process and what emerges from it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:11.740" style="s2">I think is if you&#39;ll allow me this term</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.620" end="00:08:13.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the stand-in for the divine double</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.740" end="00:08:15.970" style="s2">to which towards which we are aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.600" end="00:08:18.010" style="s2">it&#39;s the symbol on it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.970" end="00:08:20.110" style="s2">actually enacted symbol that joins this</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.010" end="00:08:23.560" style="s2">self to the future self that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.110" end="00:08:30.480" style="s2">be being drawn to this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.560" end="00:08:34.390" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s how III see that and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.480" end="00:08:36.430" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m also interested in the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.390" end="00:08:39.430" style="s2">I think there&#39;s both this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.430" end="00:08:41.890" style="s2">looking forward like we&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.430" end="00:08:44.590" style="s2">but there&#39;s also the retrospective we</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.890" end="00:08:46.450" style="s2">keep circling back retrospectively and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.590" end="00:08:49.390" style="s2">trying to get at what&#39;s grounding this</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.450" end="00:08:51.580" style="s2">well so we&#39;re prospecting towards the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.390" end="00:08:52.600" style="s2">emergence but we&#39;re also retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.580" end="00:08:55.300" style="s2">towards the ground</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.600" end="00:08:57.310" style="s2">what is grounding this that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.300" end="00:08:58.839" style="s2">kind of an emergent possible because you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.310" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">can really only ask about the ground</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.839" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">when you see some of its promise</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:04.029" style="s2">fulfilled in the emergence and you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:05.860" style="s2">only make sense of the emergence in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.029" end="00:09:07.420" style="s2">terms of the intelligibility of afforded</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.860" end="00:09:10.089" style="s2">by the ground so I think there&#39;s both a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.420" end="00:09:20.920" style="s2">prospective and a retrospective move</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.089" end="00:09:24.430" style="s2">that&#39;s going on also within this and as</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.920" end="00:09:26.889" style="s2">you as that settles in and I just get</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.430" end="00:09:30.250" style="s2">the whole of everything you just said it</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.889" end="00:09:32.440" style="s2">the implicit sense of vulnerability the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.250" end="00:09:38.199" style="s2">characteristic of vulnerability just</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.440" end="00:09:42.910" style="s2">makes when it occurs is a virtue of it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.199" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">right and necessary like a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.910" end="00:09:48.459" style="s2">structural component of it in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:50.410" style="s2">sense exactly exactly so what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.459" end="00:09:52.839" style="s2">to do is use the phenomenology and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.410" end="00:09:54.819" style="s2">functionality to articulate how we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.839" end="00:09:57.759" style="s2">understand vulnerability as one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.819" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">virtues that is necessary to the good</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.759" end="00:10:02.199" style="s2">practice of dialectic exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:05.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what I that&#39;s what Kris and I are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.199" end="00:10:07.870" style="s2">trying to work on right now one of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.740" end="00:10:11.380" style="s2">things I think that in terms of finding</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.870" end="00:10:13.180" style="s2">an ingress into the process itself one</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.380" end="00:10:14.620" style="s2">of the things and you and I were talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.180" end="00:10:17.579" style="s2">about this John I was thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.620" end="00:10:21.009" style="s2">more this morning actually and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.579" end="00:10:23.050" style="s2">there&#39;s something in these dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.009" end="00:10:25.720" style="s2">part of what makes these so commodious</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.050" end="00:10:28.029" style="s2">these dialogues and part of what spatial</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.720" end="00:10:29.350" style="s2">eise&#39;s the presence that the divine</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.029" end="00:10:31.899" style="s2">double presence that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.350" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">about guy there&#39;s a way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.899" end="00:10:38.410" style="s2">apt dialogo spatial eise&#39;s that presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:40.449" style="s2">it opens between the participants you</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.410" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">open a space in which the presence</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.449" end="00:10:49.470" style="s2">actually emerges and I think the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:51.030" style="s2">the that insemination has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.470" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">with the way that we treat our</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.030" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">propositions in the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:59.610" style="s2">dialogue so I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:01.110" style="s2">noticed in both of it Gaia and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.610" end="00:11:02.820" style="s2">both of you actually do this just</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.110" end="00:11:05.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter of course I&#39;ve noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.820" end="00:11:07.170" style="s2">that you treat I think this is right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.010" end="00:11:10.500" style="s2">I think this is actually I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.170" end="00:11:14.070" style="s2">a it&#39;s a profound practice that I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.500" end="00:11:16.170" style="s2">you seem to do in implicitly which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.070" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">that you treat each proposition as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.170" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">kind of micro analogue for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:25.290" style="s2">relationship exemplified by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">conversation oh this is great also so</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.290" end="00:11:33.090" style="s2">that whatever else we are discussing we</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:35.820" style="s2">are discussing the relationship right</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.090" end="00:11:38.490" style="s2">sort of like imagine that the two hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.820" end="00:11:40.830" style="s2">mutually gripping the twin logo of hands</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.490" end="00:11:45.470" style="s2">mutually gripping one another every</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.830" end="00:11:49.140" style="s2">object that they take into hand is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.470" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">beholding them as it is beholden right</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.140" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">whatever we take into hand we are also</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:57.870" style="s2">feeling we are feeling the hands that</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">are gripping the object and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.870" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">way in which each proposition as it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:05.460" style="s2">traded contains within it that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:07.110" style="s2">microcosmic presence of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.460" end="00:12:08.850" style="s2">relationship and there&#39;s an assonance</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.110" end="00:12:11.100" style="s2">between them at the different levels and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.850" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">if we treat every proposition as that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.100" end="00:12:15.030" style="s2">micro analog for the relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:17.730" style="s2">and we realize that as we&#39;re treating</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.030" end="00:12:22.140" style="s2">propositions we are treating the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.730" end="00:12:23.910" style="s2">in a sort of more digital form almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.140" end="00:12:26.730" style="s2">holographic the way you&#39;re describing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.910" end="00:12:28.080" style="s2">members yeah yeah we yeah we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.730" end="00:12:33.210" style="s2">talking about that that was beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.080" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">said by the way yeah like the way you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.210" end="00:12:41.340" style="s2">talk that was good often you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:42.660" style="s2">actually I physically painful but not in</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.340" end="00:12:47.000" style="s2">a bad way</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.660" end="00:12:47.000" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:57.850" style="s2">she were invoking and expressing and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.139" end="00:12:59.320" style="s2">carefulness with which you were binding</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.850" end="00:13:03.250" style="s2">the expressions that was able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.320" end="00:13:05.740" style="s2">actually be propositional while holding</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.250" end="00:13:08.649" style="s2">the thing that it was referring to in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.740" end="00:13:10.930" style="s2">wholeness that had tightness to it me</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.649" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">like drinking that it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.930" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">feeling like very specific body parts</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2">were actually being affected like my</p>

<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:24.940" style="s2">move around I didn&#39;t move my physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.350" end="00:13:27.010" style="s2">body to come into some kind of afford</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.940" end="00:13:28.839" style="s2">and conformance with what the hell was</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.010" end="00:13:30.100" style="s2">going on it was a very deep thing you</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.839" end="00:13:32.139" style="s2">were doing there because it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.100" end="00:13:34.810" style="s2">with like the like think about the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.139" end="00:13:35.949" style="s2">there&#39;s a relationship with oh man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.810" end="00:13:36.970" style="s2">actually related to we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.949" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">about earlier like what the hell is even</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.970" end="00:13:42.670" style="s2">going on here like the Internet and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">what&#39;s where where is this happening in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.670" end="00:13:47.350" style="s2">the very deep and profound sense there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">is the hole of all is expressing itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.350" end="00:13:52.660" style="s2">always already simultaneously and every</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:54.430" style="s2">expression that&#39;s where it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.660" end="00:13:56.500" style="s2">it is happening everywhere the whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.430" end="00:13:59.860" style="s2">everything right now is sort of like my</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.500" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">my vocal cords are vibrating in my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.860" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">muscles are moving and if I think about</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:06.490" style="s2">it that is the effect the universe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:09.029" style="s2">vocal cords are vibrating its mouth</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.490" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">muscles are moving as these words are</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.029" end="00:14:13.930" style="s2">expressing forth and there&#39;s the ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:15.730" style="s2">I&#39;m like feel that bigness feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:17.350" style="s2">wholeness and I think that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.730" end="00:14:21.940" style="s2">much what you were speaking to is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.350" end="00:14:24.730" style="s2">like that that sensing so Christmas I</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.940" end="00:14:26.110" style="s2">mean this reminds me and we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.730" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">about this a bit just reminds me of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.110" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">Spinoza Cianci Intuit Eva right that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.750" end="00:14:33.640" style="s2">get you&#39;re getting the whole in each</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:35.589" style="s2">part and the part disclosed in relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.640" end="00:14:37.449" style="s2">to the whole and so you&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.589" end="00:14:41.410" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to put these</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.449" end="00:14:44.399" style="s2">two together are you saying that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.410" end="00:14:48.670" style="s2">the retrospective prospective thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.399" end="00:14:50.829" style="s2">moves towards something like us can see</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">Intuit Eva that&#39;s a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.829" end="00:14:55.480" style="s2">divine double is presencing itself and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:56.769" style="s2">therefore engendering trust in me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.480" end="00:14:57.990" style="s2">just trying to gather it together is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.769" end="00:15:01.029" style="s2">that what you&#39;re that were you saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.990" end="00:15:02.110" style="s2">yeah I think so I think so because</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.029" end="00:15:04.779" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.110" end="00:15:06.670" style="s2">sort of gathering motion in the logos</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.779" end="00:15:07.769" style="s2">and and it looks right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.670" end="00:15:10.439" style="s2">that&#39;s right the gap</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.769" end="00:15:11.999" style="s2">motion of the logos has as you said and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.439" end="00:15:14.069" style="s2">you said this very well to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.999" end="00:15:17.160" style="s2">thinner in our earlier conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.069" end="00:15:19.679" style="s2">the the motion of the gathering logos is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.160" end="00:15:20.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t bi-directional motion that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.679" end="00:15:21.660" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:25.139" style="s2">and you were talking about that how it</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.660" end="00:15:28.889" style="s2">refits it reef it&#39;s the process but it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.139" end="00:15:31.829" style="s2">also it also recasts its aspiration yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.889" end="00:15:33.329" style="s2">yes yes yes yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.829" end="00:15:35.249" style="s2">that&#39;s right and so all of that all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.329" end="00:15:37.259" style="s2">that and I EJ you said that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.249" end="00:15:39.779" style="s2">beautifully just now Jordan that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.259" end="00:15:41.129" style="s2">that that that too and they all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.779" end="00:15:43.589" style="s2">they all in the one the one in the all</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.129" end="00:15:46.319" style="s2">idea that what&#39;s happening in these is</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.589" end="00:15:51.899" style="s2">that is that in every instance of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.319" end="00:15:55.290" style="s2">conversation that process the process is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.899" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2">reproducing itself all along this this</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.290" end="00:16:01.160" style="s2">analogic chain you know what it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:03.389" style="s2">reminds me of there&#39;s a there&#39;s a one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.160" end="00:16:07.319" style="s2">Plato&#39;s dialogues I think it&#39;s the ion</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.389" end="00:16:09.149" style="s2">he makes this analogy an analogy or this</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.319" end="00:16:10.619" style="s2">right this is this chain of analogic</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.149" end="00:16:14.069" style="s2">thinking going on here he makes this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.619" end="00:16:16.740" style="s2">analogy about the the magnetic the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.069" end="00:16:19.740" style="s2">Heraklion stone the magnetic stone that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:22.110" style="s2">attracts a link of chains and then as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.740" end="00:16:24.749" style="s2">attracts the link of chains each of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.110" end="00:16:27.509" style="s2">those change also activates its own</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.749" end="00:16:29.459" style="s2">magnetism it attracts more chains right</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.509" end="00:16:32.069" style="s2">so with this so there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.459" end="00:16:36.499" style="s2">this there&#39;s this constant espousal in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.069" end="00:16:38.309" style="s2">this this this chain of connections and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.499" end="00:16:40.470" style="s2">eventually I mean even though it</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.309" end="00:16:42.949" style="s2">originates in right the stone there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.470" end="00:16:46.019" style="s2">some sort of central dynamic the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.949" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">speciate sit self into each of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.019" end="00:16:49.019" style="s2">individual instantiations right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:55.009" style="s2">like the it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the idols</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.019" end="00:16:57.029" style="s2">rights like the putana kaiser yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.009" end="00:16:59.939" style="s2">talking about this last night the power</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:03.029" style="s2">of the i das its potency is such that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.939" end="00:17:04.529" style="s2">yes if its reproductive in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.029" end="00:17:06.630" style="s2">participatory knowing right to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.529" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">participatory know the other two motions</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.630" end="00:17:12.600" style="s2">the i das in every single instance of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:14.819" style="s2">yes so there&#39;s something like that going</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.600" end="00:17:17.100" style="s2">on that it&#39;s like a district it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.819" end="00:17:18.839" style="s2">in them it&#39;s and I wanted to use the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.100" end="00:17:20.900" style="s2">word empowering the word so tainted now</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.839" end="00:17:31.070" style="s2">but how you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:33.500" style="s2">I like boy but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.070" end="00:17:36.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of Cascade of empowerment</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.500" end="00:17:38.300" style="s2">that moves in both direction if this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.260" end="00:17:41.000" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get up maybe you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.300" end="00:17:42.830" style="s2">that sense of empowerment is the way in</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.000" end="00:17:44.780" style="s2">which like I was talking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.830" end="00:17:48.140" style="s2">way into which the world is calling me</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.780" end="00:17:49.880" style="s2">not just speaking to me it&#39;s moving me</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.140" end="00:17:51.710" style="s2">and I&#39;m not just trying to make use that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.880" end="00:17:53.809" style="s2">in a romantic emotive sense I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.710" end="00:17:56.179" style="s2">about in the sense of restructuring my</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.809" end="00:17:58.370" style="s2">agency affording my intelligibility to</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.179" end="00:18:00.020" style="s2">go forward and backward gathering and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.370" end="00:18:02.150" style="s2">gathering and resetting and refitting</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.020" end="00:18:05.750" style="s2">yes I think that&#39;s key to cries notion</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.150" end="00:18:07.929" style="s2">of harkening that it that the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.750" end="00:18:12.040" style="s2">intelligibility that are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.929" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">empower us they afford us they enable us</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.040" end="00:18:16.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of why I trust if</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:19.910" style="s2">something is giving me power and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.670" end="00:18:22.670" style="s2">giving me a path to my true or self I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.910" end="00:18:25.429" style="s2">gonna trust it I&#39;m gonna trust it deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.670" end="00:18:27.410" style="s2">even if I don&#39;t know and I can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.429" end="00:18:28.970" style="s2">into propositions what it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.410" end="00:18:30.290" style="s2">what the steps are gonna look like or</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.970" end="00:18:32.780" style="s2">what the final product is gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.290" end="00:18:36.290" style="s2">like that&#39;s why I&#39;m gonna trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.780" end="00:18:40.190" style="s2">trust being in the way the way and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.290" end="00:18:45.590" style="s2">movement of connectivity right an impact</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.190" end="00:18:47.390" style="s2">living back and forth not in not in I</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.590" end="00:18:51.230" style="s2">keep thinking of something my dad always</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.390" end="00:18:54.429" style="s2">said to me would say more I think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.230" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">the more profound it as he says you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.429" end="00:18:59.720" style="s2">well you can boil down all human</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:01.700" style="s2">suffering right down to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.720" end="00:19:05.770" style="s2">it&#39;s simply where man tries to put a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.700" end="00:19:05.770" style="s2">period where God puts a question mark</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.270" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">idolatrous power guy I&#39;m not proposing</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:20.780" style="s2">any idolatrous power I certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:22.790" style="s2">want to bring a full stop to God that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.780" end="00:19:25.700" style="s2">not in my job description anywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.790" end="00:19:27.260" style="s2">hope however mentalness that I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.700" end="00:19:31.700" style="s2">it sounds like what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.260" end="00:19:34.279" style="s2">and this is I&#39;m wondering if what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.700" end="00:19:36.109" style="s2">circling around here a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.279" end="00:19:40.690" style="s2">is in a certain sense what makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.109" end="00:19:43.759" style="s2">something like an we&#39;re addressing</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.690" end="00:19:46.309" style="s2">nihilism right in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.759" end="00:19:49.099" style="s2">right because like what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.309" end="00:19:53.239" style="s2">about is is it referring the differing</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.099" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">relationship right to where you started</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.239" end="00:19:59.149" style="s2">talking about this Chris is a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:20:03.830" style="s2">relationship to the proposition right</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.149" end="00:20:07.580" style="s2">and well I think what we&#39;re saying so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.830" end="00:20:10.639" style="s2">far what I&#39;m getting is that I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.580" end="00:20:14.389" style="s2">the fundament right in the ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.639" end="00:20:17.599" style="s2">right in the ever-evolving effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.389" end="00:20:20.749" style="s2">but there&#39;s not a thing a period that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.599" end="00:20:25.239" style="s2">can find that I can just stake a claim</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.749" end="00:20:27.559" style="s2">on but rather maybe the the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.239" end="00:20:29.809" style="s2">proposition and this is this harkens</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.559" end="00:20:31.759" style="s2">back to a conversation that that you and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.809" end="00:20:33.889" style="s2">I were having a few months ago John</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.759" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">where we were talking about well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.889" end="00:20:39.349" style="s2">what the measure of the proposition is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:42.529" style="s2">really to the degree that it it allows</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.349" end="00:20:47.989" style="s2">me to further question to further the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.529" end="00:20:51.589" style="s2">further the further reveal the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.989" end="00:20:53.749" style="s2">as a mystery hmm like that that like and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.589" end="00:20:56.509" style="s2">I think you linked it mm-hmm sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.749" end="00:21:00.049" style="s2">pragmatism or a truer sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.509" end="00:21:01.909" style="s2">pragmatism that that James was actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.049" end="00:21:05.599" style="s2">talking about this very distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.909" end="00:21:08.479" style="s2">the the pragma pragmatics that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.599" end="00:21:12.950" style="s2">pragmatism that&#39;s known so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.479" end="00:21:14.919" style="s2">really getting yeah I guess what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.950" end="00:21:19.700" style="s2">trying to get at is I&#39;m trying to get I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.919" end="00:21:21.259" style="s2">see there&#39;s a danger not in how you take</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.700" end="00:21:23.269" style="s2">it guy but there&#39;s a danger in the word</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.259" end="00:21:25.489" style="s2">ambiguity because M beauty can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.269" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">ground for equivocation it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.489" end="00:21:29.299" style="s2">ground for vagueness it can be a ground</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:32.149" style="s2">for bullshit it can be a ground for</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.299" end="00:21:34.999" style="s2">deception in misdirection and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.149" end="00:21:37.489" style="s2">think Plato was trying to bring about a</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.999" end="00:21:39.289" style="s2">resolution I mean he&#39;s very much about</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.489" end="00:21:41.119" style="s2">pursuing understanding rather than</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.289" end="00:21:42.589" style="s2">pursuing knowledge I agree with no line</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.119" end="00:21:44.929" style="s2">on that so not trying to bring the full</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.589" end="00:21:48.020" style="s2">stuff but I think what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.929" end="00:21:49.490" style="s2">do here right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.020" end="00:21:53.900" style="s2">and this is what the magic of it I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.490" end="00:21:55.970" style="s2">the word the practice that&#39;s big for us</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.900" end="00:21:57.920" style="s2">is we&#39;re trying to bring clarity right</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.970" end="00:22:00.740" style="s2">and clarification is not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.920" end="00:22:02.780" style="s2">as completeness there&#39;s almost a billion</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.740" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">thing that right you can&#39;t you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.780" end="00:22:08.030" style="s2">have them you can&#39;t have them both right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:09.560" style="s2">and so I I think part of what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.030" end="00:22:11.630" style="s2">vulnerability is is we give up on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.560" end="00:22:14.090" style="s2">completing but we nevertheless don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.630" end="00:22:16.610" style="s2">take that as any excuse for not pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.090" end="00:22:18.170" style="s2">the clarification and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.610" end="00:22:20.630" style="s2">trying to articulate that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.170" end="00:22:24.620" style="s2">trying to articulate yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.630" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">clarified something in my I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.620" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">know that there was something unclear</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:31.850" style="s2">until you clarified it yes yeah so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:33.560" style="s2">is a please Chris please no no please</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.850" end="00:22:37.400" style="s2">join glad so there&#39;s there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.560" end="00:22:39.310" style="s2">about the when I was I was feeling the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.400" end="00:22:41.930" style="s2">word that came up for me was life and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.310" end="00:22:45.110" style="s2">life is living on the razor&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.930" end="00:22:47.690" style="s2">always balancing a board movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.110" end="00:22:50.810" style="s2">between the actualized and the potential</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.690" end="00:22:52.100" style="s2">and the possible and so every move this</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.810" end="00:22:53.300" style="s2">movement of clarification because we</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.100" end="00:22:56.450" style="s2">were just there we just had it right you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.300" end="00:22:58.820" style="s2">had John expressed in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.450" end="00:23:01.270" style="s2">generated clarity clarification but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.820" end="00:23:03.320" style="s2">clarification was simultaneously a</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.270" end="00:23:05.330" style="s2">realization actualization a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.320" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">concretization of something it made</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.330" end="00:23:10.130" style="s2">something makes sense in a deeper way</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:12.170" style="s2">and an opening right and that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.130" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">what avoids this this thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.170" end="00:23:15.950" style="s2">were concerned about is that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:19.040" style="s2">movement movement is one that increases</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.950" end="00:23:21.230" style="s2">possibility and increases actuality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.040" end="00:23:26.180" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s very well said I like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.230" end="00:23:29.620" style="s2">that&#39;s very well set yes Chris what were</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.180" end="00:23:33.980" style="s2">you going to say I was yeah no no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.620" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">yeah so in all of this including what</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.980" end="00:23:38.830" style="s2">you just said Jordan there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:41.630" style="s2">there&#39;s it seems to me that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.830" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">taking shape here is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.630" end="00:23:44.600" style="s2">clarification as opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:47.750" style="s2">completeness that was good</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.600" end="00:23:50.810" style="s2">differentiation John the clarification</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.750" end="00:23:54.650" style="s2">certainly in the Socratic spirit takes</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.810" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">the form of inquiry right and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.650" end="00:23:59.660" style="s2">me think that part of what we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:01.640" style="s2">part of the spatial izing project right</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.660" end="00:24:01.850" style="s2">the dialogic specializing project that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.640" end="00:24:05.929" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.850" end="00:24:08.120" style="s2">talking about is afforded by a if I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.929" end="00:24:10.940" style="s2">retrofit your anecdote a little bit guy</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.120" end="00:24:12.260" style="s2">about your your father&#39;s little Maxim</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.940" end="00:24:15.410" style="s2">they&#39;re all those what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.260" end="00:24:19.640" style="s2">doing is replacing the period with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.410" end="00:24:21.620" style="s2">question mark as a way of opening the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.640" end="00:24:24.380" style="s2">space back up right let in in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.620" end="00:24:26.929" style="s2">the aspiring breath opens the lung full</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.380" end="00:24:30.679" style="s2">of space what we&#39;re doing but and</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.929" end="00:24:34.130" style="s2">bye-bye rebuy that&#39;s the kind of redress</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.679" end="00:24:41.870" style="s2">right that we&#39;re that we are aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.130" end="00:24:47.990" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to - we&#39;re trying to well</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.870" end="00:24:51.909" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to obviously this starts to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.990" end="00:24:54.679" style="s2">strangle conversation right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.909" end="00:24:56.900" style="s2">part of the engendering of trust the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.679" end="00:24:59.169" style="s2">espousal of trust I think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.900" end="00:25:02.150" style="s2">talking about has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.169" end="00:25:04.789" style="s2">authentication of the process of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.150" end="00:25:08.419" style="s2">as opposed to the process of assertion</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.789" end="00:25:10.730" style="s2">and so that is and that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.419" end="00:25:12.260" style="s2">that metaphoric replacement of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.730" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">period with the question mark is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.260" end="00:25:20.690" style="s2">spatial izing gesture that opens up sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:24.289" style="s2">of that the that womb-like affordance</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.690" end="00:25:29.240" style="s2">for for for more intelligibility to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.289" end="00:25:31.669" style="s2">then to then sort of lapse into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.240" end="00:25:33.860" style="s2">conversation and and then to take take</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.669" end="00:25:35.870" style="s2">shape since it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a formal</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.860" end="00:25:38.210" style="s2">change but it&#39;s a significant and formal</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.870" end="00:25:40.700" style="s2">change and I think that certainly in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.210" end="00:25:42.980" style="s2">Socratic tradition the formulation the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.700" end="00:25:49.940" style="s2">replacement of assertion with inquiry is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.980" end="00:25:51.799" style="s2">a is a formal way of of shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.940" end="00:25:54.380" style="s2">mode of conversation such that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.799" end="00:25:57.250" style="s2">becomes trusting yes such that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.380" end="00:25:57.250" style="s2">becomes progressive</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.790" end="00:26:02.410" style="s2">I want to add to that because I what</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.010" end="00:26:06.310" style="s2">that does is that shifts us off of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.410" end="00:26:08.800" style="s2">drive towards conclusion and as instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.310" end="00:26:11.350" style="s2">like the drive towards appreciation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.800" end="00:26:12.820" style="s2">allegiance says this is what you see in</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.350" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">the Socratic dialogue people come to</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.820" end="00:26:18.490" style="s2">appreciate more and more self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.980" style="s2">and the knowledge of being without</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.490" end="00:26:23.740" style="s2">having arrived at conclusions about</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.980" end="00:26:25.870" style="s2">self-knowledge and BA and then and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.740" end="00:26:27.790" style="s2">have an allegiance to the process that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.870" end="00:26:29.890" style="s2">discloses and trains them in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.790" end="00:26:31.450" style="s2">appreciation and I&#39;m using appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.890" end="00:26:33.880" style="s2">in the sense that in which you do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.450" end="00:26:35.170" style="s2">music appreciation class because this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.880" end="00:26:37.360" style="s2">the this is how you this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.170" end="00:26:40.600" style="s2">properly aspire you engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.360" end="00:26:42.730" style="s2">process of appreciation which has both</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.730" end="00:26:47.230" style="s2">us about right but it also has the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.950" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">understanding the changing of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.230" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">and salience that Plato is emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:54.130" style="s2">you can play with the other meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:26:58.750" style="s2">the term as well which is there which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.130" end="00:26:59.560" style="s2">oh in crease in value yeah yes excellent</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.070" end="00:28:37.080" style="s2">think it&#39;s very very important this is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.529" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">new kind of possibility that I mean it</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.090" end="00:29:01.380" style="s2">but it also picks up as you said on in</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.700" end="00:29:03.240" style="s2">that when Plato did something</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.380" end="00:29:04.950" style="s2">transformative to Socrates when he</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.240" end="00:29:06.690" style="s2">turned him into written dialogues so</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.950" end="00:29:08.279" style="s2">that there&#39;s a meta dialogical relation</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.690" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2">right there&#39;s a relationship between the</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:14.730" style="s2">but they&#39;re now taken up and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.840" end="00:29:17.010" style="s2">something new right there&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:29:17.010" end="00:29:22.139" style="s2">allow me to name it after you guys and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:24.389" style="s2">there&#39;s Plato&#39;s internal logic relation</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.139" end="00:29:26.820" style="s2">but that&#39;s now taken and made something</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.389" end="00:29:35.070" style="s2">even more by what right what this new</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.820" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">medium is affording us the he also you</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">know what&#39;s really interesting is one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:42.389" style="s2">the things that cuz I listen to this on</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:45.000" style="s2">on the way up to to our last dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.389" end="00:29:45.539" style="s2">with my wife in power on the way up to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.000" end="00:29:49.289" style="s2">our honeymoon</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.539" end="00:29:52.230" style="s2">and and it was I would a lot of what I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.289" end="00:29:57.389" style="s2">was listening to was like how she was</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.230" end="00:29:59.549" style="s2">hearing it and and she&#39;s I mean she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.389" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">got that you know she&#39;s married to me so</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.549" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s open to hearing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:09.940" style="s2">stuff right she&#39;s so happy I had friends</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:09.940" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.059" end="00:30:16.110" style="s2">ie you know I probably won&#39;t be woken up</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:19.070" style="s2">in the middle of the night having to</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.110" end="00:30:20.970" style="s2">listen to this stuff you know but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.070" end="00:30:24.270" style="s2">but one of the things that was really</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.970" end="00:30:28.230" style="s2">interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.270" end="00:30:30.929" style="s2">this this that she actually implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.230" end="00:30:32.910" style="s2">could not be be part of the dialogue we</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.929" end="00:30:34.590" style="s2">had to stop it at so many times and she</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.910" end="00:30:39.450" style="s2">hadn&#39;t say oh my god this is did it</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.590" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">enough and and the other thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.450" end="00:30:46.100" style="s2">was striking about it is she kept being</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:50.070" style="s2">moved by how much affinity was built</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.100" end="00:30:55.170" style="s2">between us right hmm if that was such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.070" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">such a a collaborative heart of and is</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.170" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">that at the you know and I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">experiencing the same thing as I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:03.210" style="s2">listening to it and I&#39;ve heard alike</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:05.070" style="s2">lots of comments about it yeah okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.210" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">interesting about the about the YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.070" end="00:31:11.550" style="s2">where people were just really moved in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:13.950" style="s2">to it to a in in a certain sense a and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.550" end="00:31:18.090" style="s2">ecstatic kind of affinity that is a vote</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.950" end="00:31:21.090" style="s2">through this yeah and so in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.090" end="00:31:24.300" style="s2">medium it does feel like it&#39;s were able</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.090" end="00:31:27.530" style="s2">to share something that people can find</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.300" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">themselves emotionally impacted by and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.530" end="00:31:34.620" style="s2">share with us in a way that has them</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:38.910" style="s2">spontaneously join the dialogue even</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.620" end="00:31:41.940" style="s2">though not the inner route lockers</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.910" end="00:31:44.580" style="s2">aren&#39;t present in a spatial temporal</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.940" end="00:31:46.260" style="s2">sense right in a certain way so i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.580" end="00:31:47.910" style="s2">i think that i think the transform and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.260" end="00:31:49.350" style="s2">it&#39;s funny because it I think it looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.910" end="00:31:51.750" style="s2">like they required a loop which is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.350" end="00:31:53.970" style="s2">John invoked it as yours</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.750" end="00:31:55.559" style="s2">but I think the transform is the key</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.970" end="00:31:57.480" style="s2">thing which is to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.559" end="00:32:00.150" style="s2">particular event the particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.480" end="00:32:02.190" style="s2">spatiotemporal correspondence of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.150" end="00:32:04.650" style="s2">attention and intention into something</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.190" end="00:32:08.550" style="s2">that is recorded is not the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.650" end="00:32:11.190" style="s2">thing is the oceanic capacity that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.550" end="00:32:13.140" style="s2">beginning to emerge of which this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.190" end="00:32:16.980" style="s2">both a result representation and a part</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.140" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">so to the degree to which your wife has</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.980" end="00:32:22.740" style="s2">a conversation that is akin to as of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:24.420" style="s2">same spirit of this conversation she</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.740" end="00:32:26.010" style="s2">cannot help but be embodying some</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.420" end="00:32:28.290" style="s2">portion what it was she was imbibing in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.010" end="00:32:30.120" style="s2">that conversation and whatever she</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.290" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">brings into the conversation that she is</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.120" end="00:32:35.669" style="s2">in with whoever she is with it is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:37.640" style="s2">conversation at the fabric is whole it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.669" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">is not part</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.640" end="00:32:44.549" style="s2">so so I wonder if that&#39;s a design</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:48.030" style="s2">feature of this Jordan should it be that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.549" end="00:32:50.340" style="s2">this practice is always practiced under</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.030" end="00:32:52.380" style="s2">the normativity given this new medium</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.340" end="00:32:55.020" style="s2">that we should be harkening for</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.380" end="00:32:56.820" style="s2">participation right that we that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.020" end="00:32:59.340" style="s2">carried out in such a way that those who</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.820" end="00:33:01.290" style="s2">listen are and try to use the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.340" end="00:33:03.590" style="s2">sense here they&#39;re they&#39;re called into</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.290" end="00:33:07.410" style="s2">right there they&#39;re they&#39;re called in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.590" end="00:33:08.750" style="s2">participation with it is that an</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.410" end="00:33:11.850" style="s2">implication of what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.750" end="00:33:13.620" style="s2">absolutely in fact the and that calling</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.850" end="00:33:15.780" style="s2">is this sort of it&#39;s omnipresent it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.620" end="00:33:17.400" style="s2">always there it is being able to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.780" end="00:33:20.120" style="s2">relationship with the omnipresent</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.400" end="00:33:22.350" style="s2">possibility and then to further that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.120" end="00:33:25.650" style="s2">actualization that increases the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.350" end="00:33:28.260" style="s2">possibility in a very specific sense and</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.650" end="00:33:29.850" style="s2">I think it speaks to that sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.260" end="00:33:31.620" style="s2">we were talking about in the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.850" end="00:33:34.520" style="s2">conversation which was what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.620" end="00:33:40.020" style="s2">engenders a certain kind of faith right</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.520" end="00:33:42.960" style="s2">and in that one finds oneself already in</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.020" end="00:33:46.679" style="s2">the conversation it&#39;s not a stepping</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.960" end="00:33:49.230" style="s2">back in agreeing with you actually find</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.679" end="00:33:51.419" style="s2">yourself already going oh I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.230" end="00:33:55.620" style="s2">think I didn&#39;t even realize I have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.419" end="00:33:57.900" style="s2">concerned about this but in the in on</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.620" end="00:34:01.799" style="s2">some level there is a connect there</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.900" end="00:34:04.620" style="s2">isn&#39;t this that that&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.799" end="00:34:06.419" style="s2">participatory element because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.620" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">knowing that comes from identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.419" end="00:34:10.290" style="s2">something inside of yourself as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:12.270" style="s2">to just asserting of proper position</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.290" end="00:34:14.129" style="s2">applying a skill or adopting a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.270" end="00:34:16.530" style="s2">perspective when you say I&#39;ve already</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.530" end="00:34:20.399" style="s2">time right on these dialogues I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.419" end="00:34:22.530" style="s2">already thinking along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.399" end="00:34:25.230" style="s2">there&#39;s an identification something in</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.530" end="00:34:26.669" style="s2">them identifies it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.230" end="00:34:29.010" style="s2">mean they participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.669" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">conversation because it calls worth but</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.010" end="00:34:33.530" style="s2">that that means there has to be I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:36.060" style="s2">know a sensibility of the of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.060" end="00:34:39.659" style="s2">jord the same we have to be we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.859" end="00:34:41.399" style="s2">have a sensibility to this directed</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.659" end="00:34:45.480" style="s2">towards the fact that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.399" end="00:34:47.460" style="s2">speaking we have to be speaking to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.480" end="00:34:49.710" style="s2">potential of calling forth from people</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.460" end="00:34:51.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s a midwifery like Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.710" end="00:34:53.099" style="s2">said and what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.000" end="00:34:54.750" style="s2">we have to we we have to touch people so</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.099" end="00:34:56.460" style="s2">they feel that they are conceiving</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.750" end="00:34:58.260" style="s2">they&#39;re both they&#39;re both to give birth</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.460" end="00:35:01.079" style="s2">which is a participatory metaphor right</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.260" end="00:35:03.089" style="s2">I think I like you see I&#39;m sorry I keep</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.079" end="00:35:04.410" style="s2">circling back I&#39;m trying to get at what</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.410" end="00:35:08.369" style="s2">normativity how is it working there so</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.869" end="00:35:09.780" style="s2">I&#39;m going to keep sort of redirecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.369" end="00:35:12.030" style="s2">things this way I hope you guys don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:35:31.560" end="00:35:36.930" style="s2">telling may be may be very telling of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.630" end="00:35:39.810" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about right now is I</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.930" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">was struck by what the who is with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.810" end="00:35:44.300" style="s2">interview or conversation that you had</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:47.400" style="s2">with what is her name she has the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.300" end="00:35:50.190" style="s2">quality Sevilla yeah so the looking</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.339" end="00:36:03.410" style="s2">funny these these conversations we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.069" end="00:36:05.940" style="s2">been having I I&#39;m finding myself having</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.410" end="00:36:07.589" style="s2">I don&#39;t admit men I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.940" end="00:36:10.890" style="s2">exactly how you put a bit something in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.589" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">the world of finding myself seeing my</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.890" end="00:36:18.599" style="s2">identity legitimately as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">hmm right okay the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.599" end="00:36:22.440" style="s2">like and I didn&#39;t get the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:24.089" style="s2">were like I&#39;m not a philosopher right I</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.440" end="00:36:26.359" style="s2">don&#39;t believe now that I&#39;ve had the</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.359" end="00:36:34.609" style="s2">yes I&#39;m finding myself just implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.970" end="00:36:37.800" style="s2">experiencing myself as a legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.609" end="00:36:40.310" style="s2">philosopher that&#39;s right and in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.800" end="00:36:42.930" style="s2">certain sense I&#39;m really struck by that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.310" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">um-hmm it&#39;s the realization of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.930" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">divine double mm-hmm that&#39;s what that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the realization of the divine</p>

<p begin="00:36:51.450" end="00:36:55.470" style="s2">realization of the divine double I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.460" end="00:36:58.109" style="s2">say God in yeah interesting to me about</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.470" end="00:37:00.359" style="s2">this is that is it it may speak but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.109" end="00:37:04.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like through the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.359" end="00:37:04.890" style="s2">right yes yes through the process right</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.020" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">of something</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.890" end="00:37:12.510" style="s2">that were forever like out doing our</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:14.100" style="s2">propositions right or birthing birthing</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.510" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">out of our propositions and the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.100" end="00:37:18.060" style="s2">propositions that lead to these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:21.420" style="s2">things that there&#39;s also something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.060" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">in implicitly has to do with finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.420" end="00:37:28.650" style="s2">identity right in an in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:30.660" style="s2">participatory way with each other yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.650" end="00:37:32.570" style="s2">just that really just stood out for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.660" end="00:37:36.990" style="s2">in the conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.570" end="00:37:41.550" style="s2">hermetically was revealing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.990" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">thank you for that guy mm-hmm yeah it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.030" end="00:38:01.080" style="s2">I yeah it&#39;s interesting that that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.440" end="00:38:02.370" style="s2">just sort of erupted in in a moment I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.080" end="00:38:06.930" style="s2">don&#39;t think that had occurred to me in</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.370" end="00:38:08.700" style="s2">advance of in advance of that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.930" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">realization in that moment but when I</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.700" end="00:38:14.520" style="s2">think on it now you&#39;re you&#39;re exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:17.430" style="s2">right in that it has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.520" end="00:38:20.490" style="s2">with thee it has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.430" end="00:38:23.580" style="s2">partaking of the identity of the diello</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.490" end="00:38:26.310" style="s2">ghosts and it has something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.580" end="00:38:30.630" style="s2">harkening myself in the throes of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.310" end="00:38:34.230" style="s2">identity overhearing myself as it were</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.630" end="00:38:37.560" style="s2">and what I overheard could be termed a</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.230" end="00:38:40.650" style="s2">philosopher so there&#39;s still a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.560" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">dissociation in that the identity</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.650" end="00:38:44.730" style="s2">belongs to the process it belongs not to</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:46.980" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.730" end="00:38:50.820" style="s2">it belongs to my partaking of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.980" end="00:38:53.430" style="s2">relation and it is only true in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.820" end="00:38:57.210" style="s2">context in the motioning gesture of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.430" end="00:38:59.940" style="s2">relation so when I enter into the forum</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.210" end="00:39:02.810" style="s2">with you all there&#39;s a sense in which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.940" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">feel I am possessed of the identity and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.810" end="00:39:07.470" style="s2">now the possession of that identity</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.420" style="s2">lingers beyond the conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.470" end="00:39:11.880" style="s2">what use would the conversation be if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.420" end="00:39:13.650" style="s2">did not linger after the fact right if</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.880" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">we didn&#39;t introduct it and it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.650" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">live on within us but it is something I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:21.770" style="s2">hear and not speak if</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">makes any sense right it is it is beast</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.770" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">spoken but I don&#39;t find myself speaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">it I find myself overhearing it you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:32.819" style="s2">it&#39;s funny and I bring something to mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:35.010" style="s2">I was thinking about earlier which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.819" end="00:39:36.690" style="s2">that guy when you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.010" end="00:39:40.700" style="s2">experience of sitting in your car with</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.690" end="00:39:44.550" style="s2">your wife and listening to our dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.700" end="00:39:46.470" style="s2">through your wife let you know it makes</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.550" end="00:39:48.839" style="s2">me think of that like that that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.470" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">of a little instance of a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.839" end="00:39:52.079" style="s2">that happens constantly which I find</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:54.569" style="s2">really interesting which is I think an</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.079" end="00:39:56.579" style="s2">example of what we&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.569" end="00:39:58.349" style="s2">know when you know you you sit down</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.579" end="00:40:00.300" style="s2">you perhaps you sit down and you watch</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.349" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">something maybe it&#39;s like something on</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.300" end="00:40:04.800" style="s2">TV or a film or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.250" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">you have a certain impression of it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:09.960" style="s2">has a certain impact on you and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:12.000" style="s2">sit down with in company with not just</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.960" end="00:40:15.900" style="s2">any company but you sit down with like</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:17.670" style="s2">close familiars intimates and that that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.900" end="00:40:19.740" style="s2">the second time you watch whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.670" end="00:40:21.660" style="s2">you&#39;re watching you&#39;re not you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.740" end="00:40:24.060" style="s2">listening and watching through the ears</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:25.980" style="s2">of the relationship espoused by the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.060" end="00:40:27.869" style="s2">company or in you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.980" end="00:40:30.089" style="s2">listening as an individual you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.869" end="00:40:32.880" style="s2">listening with the ear of the group and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.089" end="00:40:36.690" style="s2">so when people when individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.880" end="00:40:38.730" style="s2">affiliated by this by this this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.690" end="00:40:42.329" style="s2">distributed conversation in which they</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.730" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">partake and they&#39;re internalizing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.329" end="00:40:46.530" style="s2">conversation and then participatory</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:48.300" style="s2">knowing it I think what&#39;s also happening</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.530" end="00:40:50.339" style="s2">is that they become they they start</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.300" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">knowing through the dynamic and so they</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.339" end="00:40:55.410" style="s2">listen through it a hear through it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:59.609" style="s2">their understanding is understood</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.410" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">through it right so now when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.609" end="00:41:02.849" style="s2">when Tareq when I&#39;m becoming</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.849" end="00:41:09.450" style="s2">matter there&#39;s a sense now in which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.800" end="00:41:11.190" style="s2">I&#39;m my might I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m listening to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.450" end="00:41:14.599" style="s2">through the ear of perhaps the four of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.190" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">us or perhaps other combinations of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.599" end="00:41:21.569" style="s2">intimate dialogic partners right because</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.849" style="s2">it becomes it becomes an it becomes like</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.569" end="00:41:26.040" style="s2">an epistemic apparatus right like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.849" end="00:41:28.890" style="s2">prosthesis that&#39;s now affixed around you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.040" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">by which you know through you through</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.890" end="00:41:32.250" style="s2">which you speak right and so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:36.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a it&#39;s physical</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.250" end="00:41:36.440" style="s2">thing of that relationship yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.830" end="00:41:41.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a city transparency shift it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.140" end="00:41:44.100" style="s2">the perineum dwelling right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.880" end="00:41:45.570" style="s2">that&#39;s cool that&#39;s right that&#39;s you and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.100" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">I but as you and I discussed John what</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.570" end="00:41:48.660" style="s2">happens is that it settles like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.580" style="s2">transparency and opacity the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.660" end="00:41:52.740" style="s2">cross-fading of the transparency opacity</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.580" end="00:41:54.570" style="s2">results into a translucency right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.740" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">yes very much very much right right so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.570" end="00:41:58.860" style="s2">the translucency yeah in that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.780" style="s2">serum is the phenomena is the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.860" end="00:42:02.250" style="s2">phenomenology phenomenology the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.780" end="00:42:03.630" style="s2">is are translucent phenomenology because</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.250" end="00:42:06.000" style="s2">we see it and see-through and we know</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.630" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">and nobody&#39;s so let&#39;s put a background</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.000" end="00:42:10.620" style="s2">to the people because there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:12.090" style="s2">we&#39;re both seeing the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.620" end="00:42:14.040" style="s2">dialogue but we&#39;re also seeing through</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.090" end="00:42:15.300" style="s2">the people that&#39;s right exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.040" end="00:42:16.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a trend there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.300" end="00:42:18.420" style="s2">scene trans activity to Praetorian oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.740" end="00:42:20.550" style="s2">yeah yeah we&#39;re seeing through them in</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.420" end="00:42:22.350" style="s2">the way you&#39;re describing but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.550" end="00:42:23.820" style="s2">seeing them and appreciating them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.350" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">hearing them so there&#39;s a friends and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.820" end="00:42:26.490" style="s2">lucency</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:27.390" style="s2">and that&#39;s how they&#39;re becoming symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.490" end="00:42:29.580" style="s2">to us iconic</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.390" end="00:42:33.050" style="s2">the religious sense an icon right yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.580" end="00:42:36.120" style="s2">yes yes there&#39;s like a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.050" end="00:42:38.310" style="s2">continuity between us and and in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.120" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">beholden persons right and so then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.310" end="00:42:43.050" style="s2">yeah and that continuity that symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:44.610" style="s2">continuity is then the entity that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.050" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">perceiving right that&#39;s why you and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.610" end="00:42:47.880" style="s2">John have talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">relationship being a meta analogic</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.880" end="00:42:53.520" style="s2">entity right a symbol that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">symbols because it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.620" end="00:43:02.820" style="s2">I realize this then so when you were</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.900" end="00:43:05.100" style="s2">when you&#39;re over here and listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.820" end="00:43:06.390" style="s2">word over when you&#39;re over here and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.100" end="00:43:10.680" style="s2">yourself as a philosopher are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.390" end="00:43:12.210" style="s2">overhearing through that group that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.680" end="00:43:14.190" style="s2">group being that you&#39;re describing are</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.210" end="00:43:16.500" style="s2">you like you basically overhearing</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.190" end="00:43:21.450" style="s2">through the dynamic of a biologic</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.500" end="00:43:22.950" style="s2">process and the people yes exactly which</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.450" end="00:43:24.780" style="s2">also makes it confirming right</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.950" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">authenticated right which also means</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.780" end="00:43:28.770" style="s2">that are possible right it also means</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s more plausible because it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.770" end="00:43:36.090" style="s2">convergent it has a convergence of noose</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:37.500" style="s2">right also also it&#39;s going to be more</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.090" end="00:43:39.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not only going to be more plausible</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.500" end="00:43:41.730" style="s2">that the two things are going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.330" end="00:43:45.300" style="s2">stereoscopically fused my trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.730" end="00:43:46.050" style="s2">process in my trust in the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.300" end="00:43:48.120" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.050" end="00:43:50.070" style="s2">are going to mutually afford and</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.120" end="00:43:52.650" style="s2">reinforce each other right because those</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.070" end="00:43:55.020" style="s2">right notice how you qualified they have</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.650" end="00:43:57.480" style="s2">to be the familiar intimates for you yes</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.320" end="00:44:12.030" style="s2">process that&#39;s right hmm that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.630" end="00:44:14.010" style="s2">cool that&#39;s right that&#39;s right and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.030" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">what happens to is that is that trust in</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.010" end="00:44:21.630" style="s2">the relation also espouses trust in its</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:26.100" style="s2">participants right because the they may</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.630" end="00:44:28.920" style="s2">partake please that&#39;s right yeah it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:44:28.920" end="00:44:37.490" style="s2">of rest which is really really cool in</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.230" end="00:44:42.890" style="s2">understanding what is just transpired I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.490" end="00:44:51.960" style="s2">find myself I find my I find my</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.890" end="00:44:54.030" style="s2">understanding unbuttoned and what what</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.960" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">it took for me to understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.030" end="00:44:57.960" style="s2">were saying was what was understanding</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:00.780" style="s2">as it was happening and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.960" end="00:45:03.450" style="s2">sense of nakedness at the end of it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.780" end="00:45:05.970" style="s2">like a nakedness that felt almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.450" end="00:45:09.930" style="s2">like you unbutton my gaze all the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.970" end="00:45:12.150" style="s2">down and it stood out and went I like</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.930" end="00:45:16.530" style="s2">this this is intense right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.150" end="00:45:18.090" style="s2">this revealing sense of it which is so</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.530" end="00:45:21.120" style="s2">which is so evocative of the Hermetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.090" end="00:45:31.850" style="s2">arrows what you just described and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.120" end="00:45:31.850" style="s2">and it&#39;s aspirational quality guy merci</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.090" end="00:45:37.800" style="s2">sorry what did you say Jordan I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.700" end="00:45:41.360" style="s2">hear you what did you say just call out</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.800" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">for mercy yeah that&#39;s it there was uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.360" end="00:45:44.760" style="s2">that was that was dope</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">that was amazing there&#39;s some really</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.760" end="00:45:51.690" style="s2">amazing stuff going on there I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:54.420" style="s2">that what I would okay okay so check</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.690" end="00:45:56.280" style="s2">this out vulnerability so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.420" end="00:45:59.930" style="s2">about now how to play how to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.280" end="00:46:04.110" style="s2">participatory in this collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.930" end="00:46:06.090" style="s2">coming together into a group or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.110" end="00:46:07.950" style="s2">relationality that has an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.090" end="00:46:11.130" style="s2">capacity to be participatory in and of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.950" end="00:46:13.290" style="s2">itself and to participate in that and to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.130" end="00:46:15.930" style="s2">receive and to give and to receive and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.290" end="00:46:19.220" style="s2">to give so vulnerability now becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.930" end="00:46:21.570" style="s2">entry point into receptivity and into</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.220" end="00:46:23.490" style="s2">sensitivity in reception and then also</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.570" end="00:46:26.930" style="s2">and there&#39;s the other side of that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.490" end="00:46:30.180" style="s2">in the the the capacity and the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.930" end="00:46:32.910" style="s2">carefulness in expression so that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.180" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">sensitivity in the receptivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.910" end="00:46:37.350" style="s2">others are well met right you were know</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:39.350" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting in they you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.350" end="00:46:41.880" style="s2">actually giving something that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.350" end="00:46:44.430" style="s2">opening up and allowing that receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.880" end="00:46:46.980" style="s2">to find itself to become more capable of</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.430" end="00:46:48.390" style="s2">becoming it&#39;s more nuanced and subtle</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.980" end="00:46:50.580" style="s2">sensing capacity so that it can even</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.390" end="00:46:52.350" style="s2">grow more deeply in richer in its</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.580" end="00:46:54.450" style="s2">ability to give more to what is</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.350" end="00:46:57.270" style="s2">happening and transpiring in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.450" end="00:46:59.580" style="s2">conspiracy to inspire right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.270" end="00:47:01.560" style="s2">something along the lines of that like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.580" end="00:47:03.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a deepening and enriching of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.560" end="00:47:04.830" style="s2">that that feeling of the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.120" end="00:47:08.010" style="s2">begins with the invocation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.830" end="00:47:10.950" style="s2">vulnerability to me it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.010" end="00:47:14.750" style="s2">becoming very fluid you said you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.950" end="00:47:16.980" style="s2">into you become almost like poly</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.750" end="00:47:18.930" style="s2">polymorphic here yourself has to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.980" end="00:47:20.970" style="s2">actually unfold and unfurl in the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.930" end="00:47:24.630" style="s2">that you&#39;ve used balland like vision</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.970" end="00:47:28.350" style="s2">insight you become synesthetic and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.630" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">and oh portions of yourself like unfurl</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.350" end="00:47:32.370" style="s2">into this new thing because you have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:33.690" style="s2">flow into a shape that is not your shape</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.370" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">you have to be sensitive to the shape</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.690" end="00:47:38.940" style="s2">that you&#39;re is this your firm your</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:41.220" style="s2">particular shape that is conforming to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.940" end="00:47:42.600" style="s2">the possibility of what is available in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.220" end="00:47:44.100" style="s2">this particular container and as you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.600" end="00:47:45.930" style="s2">become more and more there it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.100" end="00:47:48.510" style="s2">more and more real and more and more</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.010" end="00:48:36.260" style="s2">totally totally I think that was I think</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.650" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">and and he went on to do a lot of good a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.609" end="00:49:15.380" style="s2">lot of good retrospection we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:17.420" style="s2">a lot of what&#39;s the grounding and how is</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.380" end="00:49:19.280" style="s2">it affording the intelligibility but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.420" end="00:49:21.290" style="s2">want to come back to something that guy</p>

<p begin="00:49:21.290" end="00:49:25.040" style="s2">also taps on another dimension of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:26.690" style="s2">vulnerability and Trust which is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.040" end="00:49:28.250" style="s2">confrontation with nihilism you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.690" end="00:49:31.430" style="s2">mentioned that guy you explicitly named</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.250" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">it as that and we and part of our</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.430" end="00:49:35.630" style="s2">responsibility as Jordan so well</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.680" end="00:49:39.410" style="s2">articulated it to the people who might</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.630" end="00:49:41.210" style="s2">be listening right and and and to and to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.410" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">speak so that they can find harkening</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.210" end="00:49:45.470" style="s2">and what we&#39;re saying is to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:47.869" style="s2">many people are coming to these</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.470" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">dialogues precisely because of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.869" end="00:49:52.310" style="s2">meeting crisis or the confrontation with</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:55.430" style="s2">nihilism and experience of disconnection</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.310" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">absurdity etc and I think if you guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.430" end="00:49:59.570" style="s2">are willing and I&#39;m not trying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.780" style="s2">suggesting I&#39;m requesting could we could</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.570" end="00:50:07.970" style="s2">we come back around to that that theme</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.780" end="00:50:09.260" style="s2">like what in what way do we see this go</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.970" end="00:50:11.270" style="s2">and let&#39;s try and bring it out and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.260" end="00:50:13.970" style="s2">dialogue but of the way crystal aptly</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.270" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">described it create the over the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.970" end="00:50:19.849" style="s2">overseer through which weakens from</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:21.500" style="s2">which we can see and hear ourselves at</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.849" end="00:50:26.750" style="s2">the I guess it&#39;s the over here as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.500" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">but what is it about this practice that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.750" end="00:50:30.230" style="s2">can be responsive right I&#39;m not looking</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:31.790" style="s2">for it we&#39;re not looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.230" end="00:50:33.140" style="s2">conclusive argument against nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.790" end="00:50:35.990" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.140" end="00:50:39.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s doable for reasons I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.990" end="00:50:42.470" style="s2">articulated elsewhere but how is this a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.700" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">response and I&#39;m using my words very</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.470" end="00:50:45.170" style="s2">carefully and I want to pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:47.869" style="s2">three meanings that Jordan assigned to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.170" end="00:50:50.570" style="s2">this word that make that a response that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.869" end="00:50:53.240" style="s2">people can appreciate our response to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.570" end="00:50:56.450" style="s2">nihilism that people can appreciate how</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.240" end="00:50:59.000" style="s2">is what we&#39;re doing a response that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.450" end="00:51:00.890" style="s2">people can appreciate yeah that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.000" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">I&#39;d like to ask now I&#39;d like to ask that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.890" end="00:51:06.560" style="s2">the logos that is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:08.950" style="s2">engendered between us you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.560" end="00:51:11.900" style="s2">the things that strikes strikes me is um</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.950" end="00:51:14.119" style="s2">you know I think an underpinning or an</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.900" end="00:51:16.700" style="s2">undercurrent of this conversation is and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.119" end="00:51:19.190" style="s2">one level were we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.700" end="00:51:20.630" style="s2">dialogue and dialogue owes and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.190" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">development of this and we&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.630" end="00:51:25.790" style="s2">ourselves what is what is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:29.180" style="s2">that&#39;s participating in what calls it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.790" end="00:51:31.070" style="s2">into participation like what moves</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.180" end="00:51:33.170" style="s2">towards it what moves away from it all</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.070" end="00:51:35.990" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s also a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.170" end="00:51:40.310" style="s2">can we can we can look at the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.990" end="00:51:43.339" style="s2">as a way of being situated in life in</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.310" end="00:51:46.520" style="s2">the world they think that&#39;s why when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.339" end="00:51:50.330" style="s2">said in the in the last dialogue when</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.520" end="00:51:53.390" style="s2">you said that that that you retorted</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.330" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">with the clicker or that question of God</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.390" end="00:51:58.460" style="s2">Chris&#39;s is does this mean that what</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:01.490" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that the world is</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.460" end="00:52:03.410" style="s2">vulnerable and that&#39;s that that was the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.490" end="00:52:06.650" style="s2">cut that seemed to be like I&#39;m like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.410" end="00:52:08.510" style="s2">summarizing culminating opening point in</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.650" end="00:52:11.869" style="s2">that dialogue work like we&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.510" end="00:52:14.900" style="s2">of you know blown away and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.869" end="00:52:18.170" style="s2">about if that question actually points</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.900" end="00:52:20.510" style="s2">to a response to nihilism writing</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.170" end="00:52:25.990" style="s2">president because if we can experience</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.510" end="00:52:28.220" style="s2">right in some way the world being an</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.990" end="00:52:29.570" style="s2">animate responsiveness and of</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.220" end="00:52:31.670" style="s2">vulnerability yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.570" end="00:52:34.730" style="s2">then I don&#39;t have like then then I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.670" end="00:52:39.650" style="s2">have the experience of living meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.730" end="00:52:40.250" style="s2">right honest that that that is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.650" end="00:52:42.680" style="s2">that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.250" end="00:52:46.250" style="s2">that people are really wanting and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.680" end="00:52:49.970" style="s2">what is missing right in people&#39;s daily</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.250" end="00:52:51.650" style="s2">lives right is this sense of that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.970" end="00:52:53.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t when they look out at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.650" end="00:52:56.140" style="s2">shopping mall and the different the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.720" end="00:52:58.730" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t have any sense to it right</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.140" end="00:53:04.550" style="s2">that they can experience they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.730" end="00:53:07.099" style="s2">it and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.550" end="00:53:10.010" style="s2">good yeah it&#39;s kind of leaving with that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.099" end="00:53:11.840" style="s2">but I just I&#39;m not gonna I just wanna</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">this is just to make sure I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.840" end="00:53:16.849" style="s2">understood so part of what you seem to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:20.450" style="s2">be saying is people are drawn to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.849" end="00:53:22.820" style="s2">this process the DIA logos the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.450" end="00:53:26.420" style="s2">that engenders the DIA logos because</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.820" end="00:53:29.060" style="s2">they are they get they see an</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.420" end="00:53:30.980" style="s2">exemplification of an aspect of being</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.060" end="00:53:33.940" style="s2">let&#39;s say I&#39;ll try to use a word very</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.980" end="00:53:36.530" style="s2">comprehensively here that espouses</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.940" end="00:53:40.090" style="s2">vulnerability that espouses receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.530" end="00:53:43.960" style="s2">and that allows for that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.090" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">connectedness right touching ness</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.960" end="00:53:49.490" style="s2">contact intimacy with the world that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.660" style="s2">people are hungry for in the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.490" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">crisis did I understand you correctly</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.660" end="00:53:57.140" style="s2">yes yes in a certain sense I my</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:54:00.109" style="s2">understanding a part of the nihilism is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.140" end="00:54:05.869" style="s2">so intricately like we&#39;re you know this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.109" end="00:54:08.300" style="s2">the the scientific horizon has people</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.869" end="00:54:10.040" style="s2">kind of pre reflectively just look at it</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.300" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">and sees it as not something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.040" end="00:54:17.150" style="s2">vulnerable or responsive us or feels us</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:20.359" style="s2">but that it&#39;s inert matter that we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.150" end="00:54:22.520" style="s2">act upon and it&#39;ll go on with us or</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.359" end="00:54:24.560" style="s2">without us and that&#39;s a lot less worth</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.520" end="00:54:36.320" style="s2">so I mean I mean nihilism is really</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.560" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">complicated right about it but that but</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.320" end="00:54:41.570" style="s2">but III think that there could be a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:46.190" style="s2">and I think its inherent in what draws</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.570" end="00:54:48.320" style="s2">us to converse and notice it is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.190" end="00:54:50.690" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way in which this can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.320" end="00:54:53.960" style="s2">this could be seen as a like a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.690" end="00:54:55.730" style="s2">right of a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.960" end="00:54:59.660" style="s2">symbol to relate with the universe per</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.730" end="00:55:02.780" style="s2">se right in a living way right in</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.660" end="00:55:05.750" style="s2">everything so it&#39;s it&#39;s is it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.750" end="00:55:12.109" style="s2">a way of being and their and their and</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.869" end="00:55:13.609" style="s2">their response to the meaning crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.109" end="00:55:15.560" style="s2">always going to be a way of being as</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.609" end="00:55:17.960" style="s2">opposed to a proposition a set of</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.560" end="00:55:19.580" style="s2">propositions is that is that a fair yes</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.960" end="00:55:22.369" style="s2">yeah okay well here we look Chris has to</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.580" end="00:55:24.349" style="s2">say because he&#39;s been no no it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.369" end="00:55:26.990" style="s2">it&#39;s no it&#39;s good it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.349" end="00:55:29.210" style="s2">so I guy you connecting these two things</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.990" end="00:55:31.369" style="s2">together the vulnerability the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.210" end="00:55:33.500" style="s2">the world&#39;s vulnerability and nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.369" end="00:55:37.070" style="s2">is is like what an insight that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.500" end="00:55:39.080" style="s2">because one formulation one for one</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.070" end="00:55:40.580" style="s2">possible formulation of the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.080" end="00:55:43.849" style="s2">nihilism is that the body of the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.580" end="00:55:45.530" style="s2">is barren right that it is inaccessible</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.849" end="00:55:47.869" style="s2">to us that it&#39;s closed that it is no</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.530" end="00:55:50.109" style="s2">longer suggestible or impressionable and</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.869" end="00:55:52.430" style="s2">that means that there is it is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.109" end="00:55:55.790" style="s2">fertilized Abul and so I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.430" end="00:55:57.470" style="s2">the one of the one of the projects any</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.790" end="00:56:00.619" style="s2">response to the main crisis has to find</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.470" end="00:56:02.869" style="s2">a way to refer to lies the world and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.619" end="00:56:04.430" style="s2">then and then even and all of your</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.869" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">language guy once again like there</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.430" end="00:56:09.980" style="s2">there&#39;s this embodied vernacular of Eros</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:12.200" style="s2">emerging and and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.980" end="00:56:14.599" style="s2">vulnerability the and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.200" end="00:56:16.700" style="s2">phenomenological suggestibility and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.599" end="00:56:19.369" style="s2">process of symbolizing the world is</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.700" end="00:56:21.320" style="s2">something approximating this dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.369" end="00:56:24.710" style="s2">project like that what we&#39;re aiming to</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.320" end="00:56:28.270" style="s2">do is what we&#39;re aiming to do is</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.710" end="00:56:30.500" style="s2">mutually be fertilized with the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.270" end="00:56:31.970" style="s2">because if the proud if one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.500" end="00:56:33.830" style="s2">problems of nihilism is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.970" end="00:56:35.810" style="s2">disinterested in the world we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.830" end="00:56:39.230" style="s2">disinterested because it doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.810" end="00:56:41.480" style="s2">avail potential within itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.230" end="00:56:44.150" style="s2">opaque to us right going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.480" end="00:56:46.970" style="s2">transparency opacity issue the world has</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.150" end="00:56:49.970" style="s2">an opacity right it&#39;s commits just</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.970" end="00:56:53.240" style="s2">perennially obfuscated right barred from</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.970" end="00:56:55.190" style="s2">entry and so then I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.240" end="00:56:56.750" style="s2">projects this died of the symbolizing</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.190" end="00:56:58.940" style="s2">nature of the dialogic project is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.750" end="00:57:02.030" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to gain access to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.940" end="00:57:08.230" style="s2">phenomenological texture in behind that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.030" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">opaque edifice that is otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.230" end="00:57:12.550" style="s2">none of our none of our are sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:14.380" style="s2">naturalistic probative implements who</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.550" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">can gain us access to something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.380" end="00:57:19.900" style="s2">requires a symbolic process like the dia</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:22.150" style="s2">logos so going back to the the your</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.900" end="00:57:27.850" style="s2">question John about you know what can</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.150" end="00:57:29.950" style="s2">this offer to to if not if certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.850" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">have not inoculated against nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.950" end="00:57:36.550" style="s2">then at least a countervail the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:39.460" style="s2">pathology in nihilism is to become</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.550" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">interested in the world again we have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.460" end="00:57:48.010" style="s2">trust in the potential of the world of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:50.590" style="s2">the world transforming as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.010" end="00:57:52.270" style="s2">of our practice so we were talking in</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.590" end="00:57:53.650" style="s2">the beginning of this conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.270" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">were talking about we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.650" end="00:57:57.460" style="s2">the butterflies and how part of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:57:59.050" style="s2">butterflies the butterflies have to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.460" end="00:58:03.010" style="s2">with the fact that the world that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.050" end="00:58:05.800" style="s2">entering into is phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.010" end="00:58:07.210" style="s2">altered from the world that we subsisted</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.800" end="00:58:09.640" style="s2">in prior to entering into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.210" end="00:58:13.180" style="s2">conversation so one way of regaining</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.640" end="00:58:15.190" style="s2">interest in the world is a trust in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.180" end="00:58:17.770" style="s2">potential that the world can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.190" end="00:58:21.460" style="s2">transform to our touch and that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.770" end="00:58:25.420" style="s2">dialogic process offers because it</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.460" end="00:58:27.370" style="s2">exemplifies it offers such a trust right</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.420" end="00:58:30.280" style="s2">the trust and the transformative process</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.370" end="00:58:31.840" style="s2">becomes a trust in the potential for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.280" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">world to be phenomenological eerie</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.840" end="00:58:40.300" style="s2">textured and that is the trust and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:44.340" style="s2">is that amounts to perhaps a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.300" end="00:58:47.740" style="s2">become ly interested in it well that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.340" end="00:58:49.750" style="s2">interests to be within right right and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.740" end="00:58:54.820" style="s2">dwell it yeah yeah yeah and Welling and</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.750" end="00:58:57.130" style="s2">so i but so it sounds like and you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.820" end="00:58:59.410" style="s2">know I&#39;ve sort of been sort of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.130" end="00:59:02.260" style="s2">get this to work so there&#39;s another shot</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.410" end="00:59:05.350" style="s2">at it it sounds like there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.260" end="00:59:08.920" style="s2">analog in the symbolic sense right</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.350" end="00:59:10.870" style="s2">between dialogue that dialogue that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.920" end="00:59:13.510" style="s2">can have between people and the an agog</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.870" end="00:59:15.970" style="s2">a we can have with the world because in</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.510" end="00:59:18.340" style="s2">the an agog a we can get that reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.970" end="00:59:19.320" style="s2">opening that engenders love right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.340" end="00:59:21.090" style="s2">right we</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.320" end="00:59:24.570" style="s2">a sense of the responsiveness of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.090" end="00:59:26.520" style="s2">world because as I shape myself right</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.570" end="00:59:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s another analogy</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.520" end="00:59:29.970" style="s2">is like the biological analogy of nice</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.320" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">construction the animal is shaping the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.970" end="00:59:32.970" style="s2">environment which is shaping the animal</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.470" end="00:59:34.230" style="s2">which shaping the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.970" end="00:59:37.910" style="s2">there&#39;s in the idea of niche</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.230" end="00:59:41.610" style="s2">construction in biology and an acog a in</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.910" end="00:59:44.130" style="s2">in Plato you get you get that you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.610" end="00:59:49.460" style="s2">that coupled responsiveness right</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.130" end="00:59:51.390" style="s2">the that and you get a sense of that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.460" end="00:59:52.440" style="s2">have to be really careful about your</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.390" end="00:59:53.700" style="s2">language here because it can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.440" end="00:59:55.830" style="s2">misunderstood but there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.700" end="00:59:58.020" style="s2">which the world at least the way the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.830" end="01:00:00.300" style="s2">world is disclosing itself to you is it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.020" end="01:00:01.530" style="s2">is it makes the world me in that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.300" end="01:00:03.390" style="s2">disclosure the world is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.530" end="01:00:04.530" style="s2">self-transcending as well as you are</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.390" end="01:00:06.390" style="s2">self-transcending there&#39;s a mutual</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.530" end="01:00:08.250" style="s2">opening of you in the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.390" end="01:00:11.610" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s that there&#39;s that kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.250" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">of aliveness and responsiveness it so it</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.610" end="01:00:17.400" style="s2">sounds like there&#39;s a deep affinity</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:19.950" style="s2">analogy between the sensibility</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.400" end="01:00:21.630" style="s2">transcendence between people and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.950" end="01:00:23.910" style="s2">the a negau gate between people in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.630" end="01:00:25.860" style="s2">world that&#39;s actually being afforded is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.910" end="01:00:26.790" style="s2">practice and so if people engage in and</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.860" end="01:00:29.490" style="s2">this is what you see in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.790" end="01:00:32.730" style="s2">tradition if they engage in right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.490" end="01:00:35.370" style="s2">interpersonal practice right right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.730" end="01:00:37.080" style="s2">sensibility transcendence they also they</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.370" end="01:00:39.990" style="s2">also were practicing the an agog a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.080" end="01:00:42.150" style="s2">ontological e and the two who were seen</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.990" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">as completely inter penetrating and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.150" end="01:00:50.490" style="s2">inter fording each other right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:52.410" style="s2">the two of the 2000s yeah that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.490" end="01:00:54.120" style="s2">social though opposite us and the vow of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.410" end="01:00:56.910" style="s2">the ontological mystery of the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.120" end="01:00:59.100" style="s2">converge and the symbol on right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.910" end="01:01:01.380" style="s2">what like that&#39;s white right excellent</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.100" end="01:01:03.180" style="s2">Oh beautifully said oh wow that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.380" end="01:01:06.030" style="s2">great that was really good that was</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.180" end="01:01:07.290" style="s2">really good there&#39;s a there&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.030" end="01:01:08.790" style="s2">where one of the things that struck me</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.290" end="01:01:12.050" style="s2">the last conversation we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.790" end="01:01:15.540" style="s2">this well as well is a there&#39;s a horizon</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.050" end="01:01:19.350" style="s2">that I think is you were responsive to</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.540" end="01:01:21.150" style="s2">John which by the way I always</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.350" end="01:01:27.360" style="s2">appreciate your horizons that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.150" end="01:01:29.430" style="s2">respond to whatever never been</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.360" end="01:01:31.630" style="s2">complimented that way ever before I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.430" end="01:01:35.859" style="s2">also glad that I have friends</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.630" end="01:01:42.150" style="s2">thank you there&#39;s the compliment about</p>

<p begin="01:01:42.150" end="01:01:50.140" style="s2">the you got really had a response or a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.809" end="01:01:53.289" style="s2">relief or an exuberant in the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.140" end="01:01:56.680" style="s2">that oh that the world could be now</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.289" end="01:01:58.900" style="s2">without having to personify it yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.680" end="01:02:00.759" style="s2">there&#39;s exactly yes but I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:02:00.759" end="01:02:04.869" style="s2">think is within that&#39;s an excitement I</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.829" end="01:02:06.309" style="s2">want to kind of just unconcealed what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.869" end="01:02:08.170" style="s2">important about that because something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.309" end="01:02:09.819" style="s2">important about that yeah and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.170" end="01:02:11.979" style="s2">impregnating this conversation with some</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.819" end="01:02:13.479" style="s2">wonderful conversations I&#39;ve been having</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.979" end="01:02:16.660" style="s2">with Paul van der clay and especially</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.479" end="01:02:18.309" style="s2">with JP more so and Mary Cohen we just</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.660" end="01:02:20.380" style="s2">did this we just released it I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.309" end="01:02:22.390" style="s2">yesterday a three-way discussion between</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.380" end="01:02:25.690" style="s2">us cuz I was talking about the contrast</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.390" end="01:02:27.099" style="s2">between theism non-theism and and I what</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.690" end="01:02:28.539" style="s2">you just said was something that I was</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.099" end="01:02:32.470" style="s2">groping towards in that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.539" end="01:02:34.089" style="s2">which is I was trying to say that I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.470" end="01:02:36.249" style="s2">to get to a position where I can address</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.089" end="01:02:38.680" style="s2">the world as a dow without addressing it</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.249" end="01:02:40.329" style="s2">as without personifying it right and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.680" end="01:02:43.210" style="s2">then then and that that that this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.329" end="01:02:45.460" style="s2">this is the gold that needs to be mined</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.210" end="01:02:47.079" style="s2">out of non-theism that we can get to a</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.460" end="01:02:48.609" style="s2">place where we&#39;re deeply if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.079" end="01:02:51.400" style="s2">me to verb it because it should be verbs</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.609" end="01:02:53.849" style="s2">where we&#39;re vowing the world but there</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.400" end="01:02:56.380" style="s2">is no person here and that&#39;s I think how</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.849" end="01:02:59.289" style="s2">non-theism could be understood to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.380" end="01:03:01.569" style="s2">representing sacredness and so that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.289" end="01:03:04.269" style="s2">something that I&#39;m because what the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.569" end="01:03:06.670" style="s2">concern I have right it is right that</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.269" end="01:03:08.259" style="s2">when we not that we should drop this</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.670" end="01:03:10.239" style="s2">thread because I think that this thread</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.259" end="01:03:12.969" style="s2">is wonderful its Golden Fleece threat</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.239" end="01:03:15.430" style="s2">right but as we start talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.969" end="01:03:15.880" style="s2">vow as Chris is appropriately doing by</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.430" end="01:03:17.349" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.880" end="01:03:19.029" style="s2">right and we start talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.349" end="01:03:20.710" style="s2">responsibility of the world there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.029" end="01:03:23.019" style="s2">tendency to move to where it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.710" end="01:03:25.089" style="s2">an aunt of theological theism and then I</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.019" end="01:03:27.819" style="s2">you know and then Heidegger and Vick and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.089" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">Stein and all of the people that have</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.819" end="01:03:32.890" style="s2">helped me so much come up in my mind and</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:34.900" style="s2">say what are you doing don&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.890" end="01:03:36.880" style="s2">into andö theology that&#39;s how we got</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.900" end="01:03:39.279" style="s2">into nihilism in the first place so</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.880" end="01:03:41.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the horizon that&#39;s behind me and</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.279" end="01:03:43.390" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s and I&#39;m literally</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.380" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">participating in recent conversations</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.390" end="01:03:47.290" style="s2">about what you just saw</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.280" end="01:03:49.990" style="s2">stutely put your finger on how can we</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.290" end="01:03:52.330" style="s2">though without without without there</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.990" end="01:03:58.120" style="s2">being a metaphysical person that we are</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.330" end="01:04:00.490" style="s2">addressing hmm yeah yeah how do we avoid</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.120" end="01:04:02.680" style="s2">craving images and how do we avoid right</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.490" end="01:04:04.900" style="s2">I take very deeply and I talked about</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.680" end="01:04:06.820" style="s2">this in my recent episode on the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.900" end="01:04:09.130" style="s2">crisis I take very deeply Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.820" end="01:04:11.740" style="s2">critique of Anto theology as being a</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.130" end="01:04:15.730" style="s2">fundamental grammar for nihilism right</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.740" end="01:04:18.850" style="s2">and so I part of the Getty Jordan is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.730" end="01:04:21.400" style="s2">not go back into the grammar that gets</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.850" end="01:04:23.770" style="s2">us into nihilism if we try to disclose</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.400" end="01:04:26.230" style="s2">the phenomenology of what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.770" end="01:04:28.300" style="s2">dialectic India logos and it leads us</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.230" end="01:04:29.650" style="s2">back into Ando theology I I want to step</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.300" end="01:04:33.400" style="s2">out of it because that to me is just</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.650" end="01:04:36.460" style="s2">that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve lost the game in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.400" end="01:04:38.770" style="s2">mind and then and you you raised</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.460" end="01:04:39.910" style="s2">something earlier that reminded me of</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.770" end="01:04:41.950" style="s2">something that hasn&#39;t been part of this</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.910" end="01:04:44.050" style="s2">conversation but it connects to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.950" end="01:04:45.310" style="s2">meaning crisis from the other direction</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.050" end="01:04:49.210" style="s2">the direction that I spend most of my</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.310" end="01:04:51.490" style="s2">time in sinistra construction yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.210" end="01:04:54.790" style="s2">and one of the challenges for that one</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.490" end="01:04:57.880" style="s2">of the the risks of niche construction</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.790" end="01:05:04.000" style="s2">is that the organism is quite good at</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.880" end="01:05:07.060" style="s2">niche construction yes I becomes hyper</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.000" end="01:05:09.460" style="s2">fragile yeah it becomes it&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.060" end="01:05:12.580" style="s2">control the changing of its context so</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.460" end="01:05:16.090" style="s2">that it itself can fit to its context to</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.580" end="01:05:18.550" style="s2">a very high level but when reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.090" end="01:05:20.710" style="s2">finally breaks that control and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.550" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">context changes the organism is now</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.710" end="01:05:25.300" style="s2">hyper fragile and it&#39;s this is but</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:27.340" style="s2">Jordan that&#39;s exactly heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.300" end="01:05:29.980" style="s2">critique of Anto theology exactly it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.340" end="01:05:31.960" style="s2">like a mob yeah yeah it&#39;s comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.980" end="01:05:33.970" style="s2">niche construction that became</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.960" end="01:05:36.790" style="s2">indispensable and then when reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.970" end="01:05:38.980" style="s2">moved beyond it right if it revealed</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.790" end="01:05:42.100" style="s2">itself for all of its monolithic</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.980" end="01:05:44.770" style="s2">momentum it revealed itself as hyper</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.100" end="01:05:46.510" style="s2">fragile and that&#39;s that&#39;s heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.770" end="01:05:49.810" style="s2">argument for the emergence of nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.510" end="01:05:52.150" style="s2">so so we humans are our move are moving</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.810" end="01:05:54.850" style="s2">now very quickly into a phase where our</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.150" end="01:05:58.930" style="s2">capacity for niche construction must</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.850" end="01:06:02.410" style="s2">achieve a enduring</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.930" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">escape from that trap yes yes are now</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.410" end="01:06:05.559" style="s2">fully responsible for the world in which</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:08.530" style="s2">we live</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.559" end="01:06:11.079" style="s2">I dropped the ball if we get captured by</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.530" end="01:06:13.869" style="s2">this construct that will shatter in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.079" end="01:06:16.059" style="s2">way then we bring the whole of the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.869" end="01:06:18.550" style="s2">with us at the biological lid level</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.059" end="01:06:21.130" style="s2">right so our meaning crisis is both</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.550" end="01:06:23.020" style="s2">sides of the word meaning it is both the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.130" end="01:06:25.420" style="s2">sense and feeling of meaning that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.020" end="01:06:29.020" style="s2">have and it is in fact it be means the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.420" end="01:06:31.900" style="s2">actual words well it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.020" end="01:06:34.990" style="s2">simultaneously and both must be resolved</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.900" end="01:06:37.119" style="s2">and both can be resolved which creates</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.990" end="01:06:38.650" style="s2">the gift right that&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.119" end="01:06:40.660" style="s2">everybody&#39;s been talking about is in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.650" end="01:06:43.480" style="s2">inquiry into this question now for</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.660" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">10,000 years is that when we are able to</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.480" end="01:06:47.740" style="s2">achieve a level of skillfulness in</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:49.000" style="s2">navigating this inquiry the inquiry that</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.740" end="01:06:51.760" style="s2">we&#39;re entering into this question of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.000" end="01:06:54.069" style="s2">game bait we then also achieved the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.760" end="01:06:56.740" style="s2">level of skillfulness to be responsible</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.069" end="01:06:58.750" style="s2">for niche construction in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.740" end="01:07:00.369" style="s2">enduring we take responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.750" end="01:07:03.630" style="s2">world that takes responsibility for us</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.369" end="01:07:06.099" style="s2">and we are no longer on the path of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.630" end="01:07:08.200" style="s2">potentially running into a running off</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.099" end="01:07:09.730" style="s2">ground into extinction that has always</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.200" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">faced us it always pays to every</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.730" end="01:07:13.450" style="s2">organism we&#39;re in a different game yes</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:14.920" style="s2">this goes right to the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.450" end="01:07:16.720" style="s2">conversation Jordan you and I had about</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.920" end="01:07:18.819" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion mmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.720" end="01:07:21.130" style="s2">this is this is exactly the problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.819" end="01:07:23.859" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to address with it with</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.130" end="01:07:25.540" style="s2">that um thank you for doing that I think</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.859" end="01:07:26.740" style="s2">that that the way you just drew</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.540" end="01:07:29.230" style="s2">everything together I think that was</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.740" end="01:07:30.670" style="s2">blowing I I think that what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.230" end="01:07:33.010" style="s2">in response to that which I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.670" end="01:07:35.349" style="s2">is it&#39;s just an implication is the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.010" end="01:07:37.960" style="s2">issue I had was on Toronto theology is</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.349" end="01:07:40.780" style="s2">it Those to the world&#39;s so much that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.960" end="01:07:42.880" style="s2">vulnerability of the world is lost and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.780" end="01:07:48.250" style="s2">it becomes it becomes right this</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:49.329" style="s2">freezing right just locking down and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.250" end="01:07:50.770" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.329" end="01:07:52.180" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s critique because once we get</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.770" end="01:07:55.480" style="s2">the world once we get our ontology</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.180" end="01:07:57.490" style="s2">frozen by Anto theology and as you said</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.480" end="01:08:00.190" style="s2">and then though the world as if always</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.490" end="01:08:02.589" style="s2">will reality goes beyond that then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.190" end="01:08:04.569" style="s2">lose touch with the world nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.589" end="01:08:08.200" style="s2">because our touch is frozed it has been</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.569" end="01:08:10.390" style="s2">numbed by that framework so what the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.200" end="01:08:11.410" style="s2">question I have okay is like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.390" end="01:08:13.270" style="s2">things that caught my</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.410" end="01:08:17.770" style="s2">tension was I think in the in just the</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.270" end="01:08:21.150" style="s2">way that I think John you put it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.770" end="01:08:25.210" style="s2">while our niches become so context</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.150" end="01:08:28.690" style="s2">fitted for the over we&#39;re fitting such</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.210" end="01:08:34.000" style="s2">that the reality when reality shifts it</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.690" end="01:08:37.900" style="s2">becomes highly brittle yeah in its over</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.000" end="01:08:39.850" style="s2">fit in this what is what what is it</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.900" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">related to if it&#39;s not related to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.850" end="01:08:44.830" style="s2">reality right there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:46.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.830" end="01:08:49.690" style="s2">if kind of that&#39;s inherently a little</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.810" end="01:08:53.259" style="s2">bit what we&#39;re talking about is mmm like</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.690" end="01:08:56.589" style="s2">if there&#39;s a reality that can overflow</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.259" end="01:08:59.560" style="s2">it and it become brittle what exactly is</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.589" end="01:09:03.160" style="s2">it related to in it&#39;s over Fitness that</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.560" end="01:09:05.650" style="s2">isn&#39;t reality and how does it I just got</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.160" end="01:09:08.819" style="s2">I was struck by that the presuppositions</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.650" end="01:09:12.100" style="s2">of that that statement that&#39;s telling</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.819" end="01:09:14.350" style="s2">well I mean in the original metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.100" end="01:09:16.480" style="s2">that Jordan invoked of course the it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.350" end="01:09:18.540" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a particular environment</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.480" end="01:09:21.310" style="s2">and the world has multiple environments</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.540" end="01:09:24.100" style="s2">and so I think you could extend that</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.310" end="01:09:27.370" style="s2">analogy the world has sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.100" end="01:09:29.500" style="s2">aspects that that that our relevance</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.370" end="01:09:31.750" style="s2">realization machinery can couple to we</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.500" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">ask sexualized the world but if we you</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.750" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">if we lose the translucency of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:41.020" style="s2">aspectual &#39;ti right and and we we it</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:43.150" style="s2">becomes a no pig veneer that is now</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.020" end="01:09:45.670" style="s2">stuck to the world and hardens the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.150" end="01:09:47.770" style="s2">and then ultimately when if the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.670" end="01:09:49.449" style="s2">slips away behind it right we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.770" end="01:09:52.179" style="s2">touch with the world now which is</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.449" end="01:09:54.850" style="s2">touching this surface that we&#39;ve made so</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.179" end="01:09:56.530" style="s2">I think just like I&#39;m trying to build on</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.850" end="01:09:58.360" style="s2">joins analogy right just like you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.530" end="01:10:00.820" style="s2">like here&#39;s a jungle environment but the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.360" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">problem is you know then the african</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.820" end="01:10:04.719" style="s2">rift opens up and it becomes savanna and</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:06.370" style="s2">now you&#39;re screwed because you&#39;ve over</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.719" end="01:10:08.230" style="s2">fitted through a jungle and the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.370" end="01:10:10.690" style="s2">world has moved on and introduced this</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.230" end="01:10:12.310" style="s2">new kind of environment right and so if</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.690" end="01:10:14.980" style="s2">you set up this kind of particular</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.310" end="01:10:17.530" style="s2">metaphysics but Heidegger called on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.980" end="01:10:19.090" style="s2">theology right you fitted you to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.530" end="01:10:21.340" style="s2">particular way in which reality could be</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.090" end="01:10:24.400" style="s2">our sexualized but reality is going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.340" end="01:10:24.790" style="s2">move on it&#39;s going to move on and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.400" end="01:10:26.920" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.790" end="01:10:27.940" style="s2">lose touch that&#39;s how that&#39;s how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.920" end="01:10:32.410" style="s2">trying to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.940" end="01:10:34.390" style="s2">did that help a guy the way the way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.410" end="01:10:36.370" style="s2">talked about it is the the thing is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.390" end="01:10:37.540" style="s2">past yeah the thing that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.370" end="01:10:41.170" style="s2">about is the past</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.540" end="01:10:43.510" style="s2">which is to say that the past embodies</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.170" end="01:10:46.210" style="s2">itself in a it&#39;s that period that your</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.510" end="01:10:49.120" style="s2">father warned you about right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.210" end="01:10:51.220" style="s2">that which has been endeavoring to make</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.120" end="01:10:54.550" style="s2">that which is and that which shall be</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.220" end="01:10:56.410" style="s2">nothing more than what it was does it</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.550" end="01:10:58.270" style="s2">make sense so this is this is actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.410" end="01:11:01.140" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking about this translucency</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.270" end="01:11:04.360" style="s2">right like let&#39;s say is like Oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.140" end="01:11:06.580" style="s2">something get becomes fitted right and</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.360" end="01:11:09.280" style="s2">then becomes over fitted it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.580" end="01:11:11.740" style="s2">opaque to the reality so there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:14.530" style="s2">translucency that gets it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.740" end="01:11:16.990" style="s2">relationship with it updates it makes it</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.530" end="01:11:18.760" style="s2">flexible look what your hands are to it</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.990" end="01:11:21.160" style="s2">this sounds like what happens in</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.760" end="01:11:22.030" style="s2">intimacy right cuz it&#39;s like exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.160" end="01:11:24.730" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.030" end="01:11:26.770" style="s2">it also I&#39;m it&#39;s kind of hearkening to I</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.730" end="01:11:28.600" style="s2">think the the thing I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.770" end="01:11:30.520" style="s2">about - a good way of looking and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.600" end="01:11:32.230" style="s2">highlighting what may be happening in</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.520" end="01:11:35.020" style="s2">this in these dialogues that make them</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.230" end="01:11:39.010" style="s2">shine forth in the way that they write</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.020" end="01:11:41.950" style="s2">is is this distinction between idle talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.010" end="01:11:44.710" style="s2">and authentic speech right it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.950" end="01:11:47.650" style="s2">this this way in where I think idle talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.710" end="01:11:51.940" style="s2">is has that quality of I&#39;m saying what</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.650" end="01:11:55.450" style="s2">I&#39;m saying so as to keep something in</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.940" end="01:11:57.490" style="s2">existence that was right and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.450" end="01:12:00.490" style="s2">like the way that the interpretations of</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.490" end="01:12:02.290" style="s2">the culture carry forth right through</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.490" end="01:12:04.870" style="s2">all of our thoughts and like its</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.290" end="01:12:08.290" style="s2">inertial its inertial yeah and it&#39;s eye</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.870" end="01:12:09.730" style="s2">to idol in both senses - yeah I just</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.290" end="01:12:10.810" style="s2">want to pick up on that motion that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.730" end="01:12:12.700" style="s2">were doing guy because I think the</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.810" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">gesture was important and I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.700" end="01:12:16.480" style="s2">to get this that not only do you lose</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.430" style="s2">touch with the world when you become</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.480" end="01:12:20.470" style="s2">numb you lose touch with yourself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.430" end="01:12:22.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a bi-directional numbing</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.470" end="01:12:25.420" style="s2">that&#39;s happening that&#39;s what nihilism is</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.510" end="01:12:28.450" style="s2">that it&#39;s that the numbing of the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.420" end="01:12:30.670" style="s2">is also it&#39;s interjected as a numbing to</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.450" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">oneself and that&#39;s when it particularly</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.670" end="01:12:34.570" style="s2">fights us that&#39;s when it really really</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:36.460" style="s2">bites us and that&#39;s why I think the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.570" end="01:12:38.619" style="s2">invocation of intimacy is exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.460" end="01:12:43.540" style="s2">right thing to say there yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.619" end="01:12:45.520" style="s2">yeah in that in that yeah in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.540" end="01:12:48.099" style="s2">of and this is why it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.520" end="01:12:49.630" style="s2">I think because and this is where where</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.099" end="01:12:51.010" style="s2">it starts I want to just bring in some</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.630" end="01:12:52.179" style="s2">parallels to some other things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.010" end="01:12:55.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talked to walk to but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.179" end="01:12:58.929" style="s2">been you know intercooling right which</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.239" end="01:13:00.760" style="s2">in many ways just kind of highlights and</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.929" end="01:13:02.949" style="s2">puts constraints on this particular</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.760" end="01:13:06.190" style="s2">thing that happens in relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.949" end="01:13:11.020" style="s2">as has been pointed out that even though</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.190" end="01:13:13.449" style="s2">it&#39;s explicitly a secular practice yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.020" end="01:13:15.369" style="s2">and talking about it using all of these</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.449" end="01:13:17.139" style="s2">terms is religious languages yeah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.369" end="01:13:19.869" style="s2">noted that too so much</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.139" end="01:13:22.570" style="s2">ya know interested that brings back the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.869" end="01:13:25.630" style="s2">thing and I still I mean and we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.570" end="01:13:27.820" style="s2">some good stuff around it so but I still</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.630" end="01:13:30.040" style="s2">find it pressing on me how did we know</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.820" end="01:13:31.420" style="s2">the world without personify it we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.040" end="01:13:33.580" style="s2">talked about why we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.420" end="01:13:36.550" style="s2">personify it but how do we vow it how do</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.580" end="01:13:41.830" style="s2">we get the intimacy genuine I thou</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.550" end="01:13:46.480" style="s2">intimacy without bringing back all of</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.830" end="01:13:48.369" style="s2">the risks of the Anto theology that over</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.480" end="01:13:52.690" style="s2">fitted us in a particular way to our</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.369" end="01:13:54.760" style="s2">historicity it saw that as a cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.690" end="01:13:56.920" style="s2">cosmic teleology so we over fitted to</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.760" end="01:13:58.630" style="s2">our historicity in a particular way now</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.920" end="01:14:01.630" style="s2">as Jordan has pointed out we&#39;re in a new</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.630" end="01:14:03.699" style="s2">stage of history and in a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.630" end="01:14:06.489" style="s2">way and we no longer no longer fits we</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.699" end="01:14:08.980" style="s2">got to how do we read out without</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.489" end="01:14:12.540" style="s2">bringing all of that game a back without</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.980" end="01:14:16.540" style="s2">bringing all that old code back that</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.540" end="01:14:19.449" style="s2">really really brought people to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.540" end="01:14:21.730" style="s2">precipice of nihilism mhm mhm yeah my</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.449" end="01:14:24.310" style="s2">mindful of in my own life the the</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.730" end="01:14:28.150" style="s2">experience of the recurrence of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.310" end="01:14:29.710" style="s2">simplicity and the sort of very simple</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.150" end="01:14:31.330" style="s2">practicality that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.710" end="01:14:33.880" style="s2">grounding so you said it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.330" end="01:14:35.800" style="s2">of being it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a story</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.880" end="01:14:37.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not an ideology it&#39;s not a theology</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.800" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">and of those kinds of things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.330" end="01:14:42.040" style="s2">way of being and in the context of a way</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.239" end="01:14:43.900" style="s2">of being what was coming up for me was a</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.040" end="01:14:46.810" style="s2">conversation I had was having yesterday</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.900" end="01:14:48.280" style="s2">which has to do with a habit that I have</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.810" end="01:14:51.960" style="s2">that my wife has and that I imagine</p>

<p begin="01:16:48.180" end="01:16:51.930" style="s2">brings you right back to Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.740" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">pursuit of virtue because that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.930" end="01:16:56.460" style="s2">where Socrates is presumably virtue in</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:58.260" style="s2">the dialogues is exactly that training</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.460" end="01:17:00.930" style="s2">those habits that you just mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.260" end="01:17:03.090" style="s2">right Jordan that&#39;s exactly why the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.930" end="01:17:05.250" style="s2">dialogues always circle around a virtue</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.090" end="01:17:05.730" style="s2">because ultimately it comes down to a</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.250" end="01:17:08.010" style="s2">verb</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.730" end="01:17:09.510" style="s2">Jewess way of being that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.010" end="01:17:11.730" style="s2">exact with it that&#39;s what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.510" end="01:17:13.410" style="s2">trained in the dialogue as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.730" end="01:17:15.510" style="s2">particular conclusion to an argument</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.410" end="01:17:18.780" style="s2">that&#39;s why the dialogues will often end</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.510" end="01:17:20.730" style="s2">in a propositional aporia but people</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.780" end="01:17:23.930" style="s2">want to spend more time with Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.730" end="01:17:26.730" style="s2">that&#39;s how a couple of the dialogues in</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.930" end="01:17:28.830" style="s2">the interlocutors who you know know</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.730" end="01:17:29.760" style="s2">agreement about courage or friendship</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.830" end="01:17:31.170" style="s2">has it been arrived at</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.760" end="01:17:32.820" style="s2">but the interlocutors say I want my</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.170" end="01:17:35.160" style="s2">son&#39;s to come and spend more time with</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.820" end="01:17:37.380" style="s2">you Socrates because the dialogue itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.160" end="01:17:39.450" style="s2">is training the habit it&#39;s training the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.380" end="01:17:42.739" style="s2">virtue that you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.450" end="01:17:45.630" style="s2">ability to to be that the virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.739" end="01:17:48.420" style="s2">receptive responsiveness the virtues of</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.630" end="01:17:51.690" style="s2">sensibility transcendence and an agog a</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.420" end="01:17:53.730" style="s2">yes like and and and it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.690" end="01:17:56.850" style="s2">important about a virtue is it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.730" end="01:17:59.280" style="s2">of being that inseminates the very most</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.850" end="01:18:01.560" style="s2">prosaic aspects of our life you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.280" end="01:18:04.680" style="s2">really honest when you&#39;re honest with</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.560" end="01:18:06.720" style="s2">your partner and right there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.680" end="01:18:10.680" style="s2">of conflict about some issue that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.720" end="01:18:13.650" style="s2">honesty really tells courage and courage</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.680" end="01:18:15.930" style="s2">like I did there&#39;s one I think the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.650" end="01:18:19.140" style="s2">Aristotle who talks about that like the</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.930" end="01:18:23.730" style="s2">virtue that that pre that all other</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.140" end="01:18:26.310" style="s2">virtues form like our enactment over in</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.730" end="01:18:27.390" style="s2">some sense is courage but also the thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.310" end="01:18:29.720" style="s2">about this thing that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.390" end="01:18:32.520" style="s2">about and I think with with with</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.720" end="01:18:34.290" style="s2">intimacy right there&#39;s I just want to</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.520" end="01:18:37.410" style="s2">bring in work something out here because</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.290" end="01:18:39.630" style="s2">there may be this we&#39;re talking about so</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.410" end="01:18:41.100" style="s2">like in systems family Systems Theory</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.630" end="01:18:42.540" style="s2">right they they have a really</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.100" end="01:18:45.090" style="s2">interesting way of talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.540" end="01:18:49.890" style="s2">intimacy where they&#39;re where they say</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.090" end="01:18:51.510" style="s2">that there is a an intimacy is is a I</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.890" end="01:18:55.020" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they said it&#39;s a function</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.510" end="01:18:56.970" style="s2">but it&#39;s in virtue of your ability like</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.020" end="01:18:58.260" style="s2">how you become intimate is directly</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.970" end="01:19:02.100" style="s2">proportionate to your ability to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.260" end="01:19:03.600" style="s2">tolerate anxiety mmm I and in and in</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.100" end="01:19:06.480" style="s2">what they talk about and this is how</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.600" end="01:19:09.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve made sense of this is is in</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.480" end="01:19:13.219" style="s2">intimacy right like you get to this you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.690" end="01:19:15.870" style="s2">get to this core existential like</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.219" end="01:19:18.390" style="s2">paradoxical drives that we have as human</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.870" end="01:19:19.739" style="s2">beings right on one level it&#39;s like I am</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.390" end="01:19:22.550" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.739" end="01:19:23.850" style="s2">I wanna like merge with the environment</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.550" end="01:19:26.969" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.850" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">I want belonging but only forever and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.969" end="01:19:30.960" style="s2">guaranteed right on every sense of my</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:33.989" style="s2">being at the same time I want to stand</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.960" end="01:19:36.450" style="s2">out in my cosmic that&#39;s right an</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.989" end="01:19:39.870" style="s2">intimacy usually has this element of</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.450" end="01:19:41.790" style="s2">risk it&#39;s like when when all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.870" end="01:19:45.120" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay I don&#39;t let your I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.790" end="01:19:48.840" style="s2">like your cooking right that&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.120" end="01:19:51.120" style="s2">right but if I but if I say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.840" end="01:19:53.489" style="s2">afraid I&#39;m gonna upset you and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.120" end="01:19:55.890" style="s2">gonna divorce me but if I don&#39;t say it</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.489" end="01:19:58.440" style="s2">then I&#39;m like not being honest about who</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.890" end="01:20:00.840" style="s2">I really am and so there&#39;s this paradox</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.440" end="01:20:04.800" style="s2">right in this tension and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.840" end="01:20:08.070" style="s2">have any ability to walk in that anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.800" end="01:20:10.950" style="s2">anxiety and in once like say your truth</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.070" end="01:20:14.219" style="s2">right and risk all of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.950" end="01:20:16.020" style="s2">right um then that intimacy won&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.219" end="01:20:18.180" style="s2">and they say that there&#39;s one of three</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.020" end="01:20:19.800" style="s2">ways that you move away from anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.180" end="01:20:22.620" style="s2">right there&#39;s one that you just</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.800" end="01:20:24.480" style="s2">addressed which is dissociation right</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.620" end="01:20:27.450" style="s2">like I hope you&#39;re enjoying dinner</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.480" end="01:20:33.390" style="s2">because I&#39;m I&#39;m on the floor I&#39;m on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.450" end="01:20:36.360" style="s2">ceiling like the other one is is to to</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.390" end="01:20:39.000" style="s2">submit which is like oh yeah I like your</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.360" end="01:20:41.550" style="s2">cooking and it and will do whatever you</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.000" end="01:20:43.170" style="s2">want to do and just not even not even</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.550" end="01:20:45.210" style="s2">address it I don&#39;t like it so I</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.170" end="01:20:46.530" style="s2">disappear I submit and the other and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.210" end="01:20:48.780" style="s2">other way that they talk about is</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.530" end="01:20:50.520" style="s2">through dominating well I&#39;ll just take</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.780" end="01:20:52.350" style="s2">control of the situation I won&#39;t ask you</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.520" end="01:20:54.060" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and I&#39;ll just move and</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.350" end="01:20:57.030" style="s2">all of those ways their ways of moving</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.060" end="01:20:59.760" style="s2">away from anxiety there are other other</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.030" end="01:21:02.520" style="s2">ones is like or you stay and you grow</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.760" end="01:21:04.290" style="s2">mmm that&#39;s the way of love that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:25:08.310" end="01:25:15.600" style="s2">think that it&#39;s also maybe highlighting</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.710" end="01:25:17.130" style="s2">the very locus in place right that what</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.600" end="01:25:19.469" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about is the vulnerability</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.130" end="01:25:21.449" style="s2">of the world in the I though the world</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.469" end="01:25:24.960" style="s2">is something to do with the nearness of</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.449" end="01:25:26.699" style="s2">it right yeah there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.960" end="01:25:28.590" style="s2">where the world on one level is really</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.699" end="01:25:30.840" style="s2">out there it&#39;s the most out there about</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.590" end="01:25:34.469" style="s2">there but but it&#39;s it&#39;s also the thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.840" end="01:25:37.350" style="s2">that&#39;s like so near it it conceals</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.469" end="01:25:40.440" style="s2">itself and its nearness it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.350" end="01:25:41.969" style="s2">is an intimacy with the world it seems</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.440" end="01:25:44.219" style="s2">to me in that we</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.969" end="01:25:48.119" style="s2">can lose track of the world it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.219" end="01:25:51.030" style="s2">close to us it both determined us right</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.119" end="01:25:54.210" style="s2">there&#39;s it there is an intimacy that I</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.030" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">perhaps we can recognize and unconcealed</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.210" end="01:26:02.039" style="s2">right maybe our nihilism numbs us to</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:03.599" style="s2">that relation that we can actually we</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.039" end="01:26:07.800" style="s2">can get in touch with what we are</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.599" end="01:26:10.170" style="s2">already pre - we are that which is the</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.800" end="01:26:12.210" style="s2">intouch nosov it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.170" end="01:26:13.619" style="s2">through something there yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.210" end="01:26:15.119" style="s2">draw you out on this I want to reduce</p>

<p begin="01:26:16.829" end="01:26:21.659" style="s2">I understand I think I understand I mean</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.349" end="01:26:22.739" style="s2">it&#39;s I think I get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.659" end="01:26:24.300" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s talking about when he talks</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.739" end="01:26:26.099" style="s2">about the nearness but you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.300" end="01:26:27.599" style="s2">thing that I don&#39;t see at least it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:26:27.599" end="01:26:33.210" style="s2">connection to the vulnerability and also</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.639" end="01:26:34.590" style="s2">to the Dowling and I get a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.210" end="01:26:37.739" style="s2">there&#39;s something there it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.590" end="01:26:39.329" style="s2">to me yet but so I want like maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.739" end="01:26:40.979" style="s2">want the rest of us to engage and help</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.329" end="01:26:42.929" style="s2">you with it I want to draw that out more</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.979" end="01:26:45.150" style="s2">because there&#39;s something there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.929" end="01:26:48.269" style="s2">something about there&#39;s a hidden</p>

<p begin="01:27:35.010" end="01:27:38.940" style="s2">wonder in this amazing way that actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.050" end="01:27:40.079" style="s2">points to this he&#39;s like he&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.940" end="01:27:42.719" style="s2">great I&#39;ve been thinking about ever</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.079" end="01:27:44.489" style="s2">since like wonder is when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.719" end="01:27:46.829" style="s2">room that you&#39;ve been in your whole life</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.489" end="01:27:50.880" style="s2">and then you lean back on the wall and</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.829" end="01:27:53.810" style="s2">you realize there was a door there</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.880" end="01:27:57.300" style="s2">and wonder is that experience of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.810" end="01:28:00.030" style="s2">recognizing right that there&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.300" end="01:28:01.590" style="s2">door to a whole nother world and that it</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.030" end="01:28:05.190" style="s2">was there the whole time and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.590" end="01:28:07.920" style="s2">somehow it was concealed to you but it</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.190" end="01:28:11.370" style="s2">was there and that experience of where</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.920" end="01:28:14.940" style="s2">the ground opens up in that ground on</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.370" end="01:28:17.610" style="s2">some sense was closer in tears closer to</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.940" end="01:28:19.500" style="s2">than yourself another another example of</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.610" end="01:28:23.070" style="s2">that is that is the movie The Sixth</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.500" end="01:28:25.320" style="s2">Sense right yeah ed the whole time</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.070" end="01:28:27.210" style="s2">no one knows that but no and then right</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.320" end="01:28:29.880" style="s2">at the end out of the corner of his eye</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.210" end="01:28:33.930" style="s2">he realizes and everyone else realizes</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.880" end="01:28:35.760" style="s2">oh my god he&#39;s dead and then and then it</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.930" end="01:28:38.610" style="s2">goes back to the very beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.760" end="01:28:40.680" style="s2">movie and all the scenes go one by one</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.610" end="01:28:45.150" style="s2">and you realize oh my god and it was</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.680" end="01:28:46.740" style="s2">obvious for full time so like also I get</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.150" end="01:28:47.970" style="s2">so let me try and piece this because I</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.740" end="01:28:48.450" style="s2">want to do this step by step because in</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.970" end="01:28:49.980" style="s2">this book</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.450" end="01:28:52.290" style="s2">ok so I get the nearness because it was</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.980" end="01:28:55.620" style="s2">her sense it was always there because</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.290" end="01:28:57.660" style="s2">what&#39;s changing it is not sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.620" end="01:28:59.100" style="s2">antic entity what&#39;s changing is its</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.660" end="01:29:01.920" style="s2">significance or relevance for you I get</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.100" end="01:29:04.380" style="s2">not so and I get so it was always there</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.920" end="01:29:07.260" style="s2">and then in the insight you also get the</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.380" end="01:29:08.880" style="s2">responsiveness that this speaks a kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.260" end="01:29:10.260" style="s2">of intimacy so that I&#39;m trying to piece</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.880" end="01:29:12.150" style="s2">this together phenomenologically I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.260" end="01:29:14.430" style="s2">got that always their nests which gives</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.150" end="01:29:16.460" style="s2">me nearness I got the responsiveness</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.430" end="01:29:19.410" style="s2">which gives me a kind of intimacy a</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.460" end="01:29:21.210" style="s2">mutual affording right and then that</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.410" end="01:29:23.220" style="s2">maybe brings the vowing is that what</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.210" end="01:29:24.960" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s not how it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.220" end="01:29:28.500" style="s2">together maybe that&#39;s how it&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.960" end="01:29:29.670" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like this sense of of this</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.500" end="01:29:31.440" style="s2">is what anything that I&#39;ve noticed with</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.670" end="01:29:33.060" style="s2">woods circling people and getting like</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.440" end="01:29:37.140" style="s2">when people have this experience of like</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.060" end="01:29:40.590" style="s2">feeling deeply seen like it&#39;s found a</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.140" end="01:29:42.420" style="s2">sense of intimacy right is almost when</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.590" end="01:29:44.340" style="s2">they have it you realize like oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.420" end="01:29:46.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve been like deprived there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.340" end="01:29:47.820" style="s2">experience of like I&#39;ve been deprived of</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.140" end="01:29:50.790" style="s2">this my whole life I didn&#39;t even know to</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.820" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">look for it usually has this way in</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.790" end="01:29:59.970" style="s2">where somebody gets like oh my god you</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:30:02.720" style="s2">so care about this like they they kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.970" end="01:30:04.490" style="s2">of perceived this inherit</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.720" end="01:30:07.280" style="s2">that the person has been grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.490" end="01:30:09.520" style="s2">and that it that there&#39;s a being right</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.280" end="01:30:13.970" style="s2">under there that&#39;s so deeply embedded</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.520" end="01:30:15.860" style="s2">and cares for it that they&#39;re in fact</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.970" end="01:30:17.840" style="s2">they are downstream from it and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.860" end="01:30:19.730" style="s2">someone kind of gets it and brings it in</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.840" end="01:30:22.160" style="s2">language and they&#39;re like oh my god no</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.730" end="01:30:24.380" style="s2">one&#39;s ever seen me before and they</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.160" end="01:30:27.530" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen themselves before but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.380" end="01:30:29.690" style="s2">fundamentally true like so that I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.530" end="01:30:33.890" style="s2">maybe one of the things that what gets</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.690" end="01:30:37.220" style="s2">numbed right in with the lack of the eye</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.890" end="01:30:39.110" style="s2">though right what gets numb is has</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.220" end="01:30:40.970" style="s2">something to do maybe with what tilaka</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.110" end="01:30:44.300" style="s2">stopped talking about in the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.970" end="01:30:50.180" style="s2">concern like there&#39;s there are already</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.300" end="01:30:53.900" style="s2">always our world is very much</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.180" end="01:30:55.300" style="s2">constituted by our concern right no so</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.900" end="01:30:58.100" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s to put ontological</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.300" end="01:30:59.930" style="s2">intimacy actually so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.100" end="01:31:02.620" style="s2">platonic recollection or the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.930" end="01:31:05.570" style="s2">sati there&#39;s a deep remembering right I</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.620" end="01:31:06.650" style="s2">get that but sorry I didn&#39;t I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.570" end="01:31:08.570" style="s2">trying to criminalize I get that I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.650" end="01:31:12.650" style="s2">that&#39;s really important what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.570" end="01:31:14.660" style="s2">to get at is like in the so in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.650" end="01:31:17.750" style="s2">dialogue I can I can I can felt that</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.660" end="01:31:20.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen yes in the an agog a can I</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.750" end="01:31:23.030" style="s2">come to feel that I&#39;m seen because</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.630" end="01:31:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s how the world is dowing I get its</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.030" end="01:31:29.810" style="s2">intimacy I get its nearness right I get</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.240" end="01:31:34.130" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s right those two come</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.810" end="01:31:36.170" style="s2">together but I&#39;m trying I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.130" end="01:31:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s something more is needed for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.170" end="01:31:40.910" style="s2">vowing right and it&#39;s something like in</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.000" end="01:31:42.740" style="s2">the an agog a its responsiveness to me</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.910" end="01:31:44.510" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want to attribute caring</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.740" end="01:31:46.190" style="s2">because that&#39;s the wrong thing that&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.510" end="01:31:48.980" style="s2">personify the world that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.190" end="01:31:51.890" style="s2">trying to get up we might end up in our</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.980" end="01:31:53.360" style="s2">pouria here I&#39;m not sure but if it is</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.890" end="01:31:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a really pregnant and good one</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.360" end="01:31:58.820" style="s2">oh it&#39;s really good I think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.280" end="01:32:05.330" style="s2">really good I I think it has something</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.820" end="01:32:08.540" style="s2">to do with being had or being known by</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.330" end="01:32:11.060" style="s2">the world yeah well yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.540" end="01:32:14.480" style="s2">yeah but I and I so yes I&#39;m gonna veer</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.060" end="01:32:15.890" style="s2">into the personifying dangers here but</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.480" end="01:32:16.430" style="s2">then maybe we can find a way out again</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.890" end="01:32:17.720" style="s2">because I</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.430" end="01:32:23.200" style="s2">think this has something to do with it I</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.720" end="01:32:26.690" style="s2">think it&#39;s important that something</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.200" end="01:32:30.550" style="s2">happens to us sometimes in a throes of</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.690" end="01:32:36.290" style="s2">dialogue with our familiars such that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.550" end="01:32:42.460" style="s2">realize ourselves known from without or</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.290" end="01:32:47.780" style="s2">had from without and a way that suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.460" end="01:32:53.410" style="s2">erupts in gratitude and I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.780" end="01:32:56.900" style="s2">gratitude as a disposition unconcealed</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.410" end="01:33:02.750" style="s2">the way ontologically in which we are</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.900" end="01:33:06.980" style="s2">had and situated beyond ourselves egoic</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.750" end="01:33:08.840" style="s2">lee i had this experience once of this</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.980" end="01:33:11.420" style="s2">now again this is all personified but</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.840" end="01:33:14.210" style="s2">let&#39;s see where perhaps we can strike</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.420" end="01:33:17.270" style="s2">out from it I had this experience once</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.210" end="01:33:23.510" style="s2">which was just a bizarre and profound</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.270" end="01:33:28.340" style="s2">experience of watching a video of my my</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.510" end="01:33:31.760" style="s2">my baptism as a kid and I&#39;m an infant in</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.340" end="01:33:37.010" style="s2">this video and the entire cast of my</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.760" end="01:33:39.350" style="s2">family everyone is present in that video</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.010" end="01:33:40.490" style="s2">you know much much much younger than</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.350" end="01:33:44.210" style="s2">they were at the time I saw the video</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.490" end="01:33:46.910" style="s2">which is just a bizarre vortex of an</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.210" end="01:33:51.350" style="s2">experience right to see yourself present</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.910" end="01:33:53.690" style="s2">at the center of a proceeding of which</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.350" end="01:33:56.300" style="s2">you do not partake in any conscious or</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.690" end="01:33:59.690" style="s2">egoic manner but that is that by which</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.300" end="01:34:02.750" style="s2">you are constituted hmm it is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.690" end="01:34:06.020" style="s2">the ultimate symbol of a gothic poesis</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.750" end="01:34:07.850" style="s2">right yes this would one ritual is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.020" end="01:34:10.340" style="s2">ultimate symbol of a gap poesis that is</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.850" end="01:34:12.620" style="s2">of course its sacramental function but</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.340" end="01:34:15.470" style="s2">there was something in that experience</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.620" end="01:34:17.450" style="s2">and gratitude is the way in because</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.470" end="01:34:20.690" style="s2">gratitude is the revelation of being</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.450" end="01:34:24.370" style="s2">constituted by forces from without in</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.690" end="01:34:27.440" style="s2">some sense there was something in that</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.370" end="01:34:30.310" style="s2">experience of being so beholden and</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.440" end="01:34:30.310" style="s2">being so known</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.320" end="01:34:37.740" style="s2">now symbolically it&#39;s by family by</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.260" end="01:34:40.410" style="s2">persons but if I were to use that merely</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.740" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">as a symbolic proxy there is a way in</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.410" end="01:34:47.040" style="s2">which we are had and constituted and</p>

<p begin="01:34:47.040" end="01:34:52.650" style="s2">part of our conversation had and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.770" end="01:34:56.910" style="s2">empowered by the world from without that</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.650" end="01:35:01.650" style="s2">we can realize intermittently in moments</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.910" end="01:35:07.860" style="s2">of intercourse discourse that manifests</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.650" end="01:35:15.210" style="s2">as gratitude but that I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.860" end="01:35:20.640" style="s2">also open up the the revelation that our</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.210" end="01:35:23.040" style="s2">Constitution is grounded beyond us such</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.640" end="01:35:26.340" style="s2">that it is infinitely and recursively</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.040" end="01:35:28.980" style="s2">realizable in any given moment right</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.340" end="01:35:31.110" style="s2">that Who I am right and this is again</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.980" end="01:35:32.790" style="s2">hard Kubas goes back to the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.110" end="01:35:34.860" style="s2">divine double right or or I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.790" end="01:35:37.020" style="s2">Tillich extended that to be right the</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.860" end="01:35:39.060" style="s2">God beyond God which I think was his way</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.020" end="01:35:40.230" style="s2">of trying to solve the beyond to a</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.060" end="01:35:42.090" style="s2">theological problem that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.230" end="01:35:44.010" style="s2">describing right if it&#39;s always beyond</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.090" end="01:35:48.380" style="s2">if it&#39;s always Beyond and the calcifying</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.010" end="01:35:51.930" style="s2">effect of idolatry is is is is is</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.380" end="01:35:54.060" style="s2">diminished at least if not obviated up</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.930" end="01:35:55.410" style="s2">right so so there&#39;s something about so</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.060" end="01:35:56.970" style="s2">anyway where am I going with all of this</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.410" end="01:35:59.130" style="s2">there was something about the experience</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.970" end="01:36:01.380" style="s2">of being so constituted and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.130" end="01:36:02.700" style="s2">realization of being constituted being</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.380" end="01:36:05.630" style="s2">had by the world</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.700" end="01:36:08.160" style="s2">at any given moment in time that has</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.630" end="01:36:09.720" style="s2">something to do with it and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.160" end="01:36:14.310" style="s2">humiliating and I mean in the original</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.720" end="01:36:17.250" style="s2">sense it&#39;s humbling that somehow I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.310" end="01:36:20.040" style="s2">for me a way in it&#39;s somehow a feeling</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.250" end="01:36:21.750" style="s2">of it&#39;s a way in it&#39;s a way it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.040" end="01:36:23.250" style="s2">know that in what it&#39;s called thinking</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.750" end="01:36:28.020" style="s2">that Heidegger tries to ground thinking</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.250" end="01:36:29.580" style="s2">and thinking he tries to say that if we</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.020" end="01:36:31.890" style="s2">can&#39;t ultimately get back to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.580" end="01:36:33.510" style="s2">thanking we can&#39;t think deeply because</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.890" end="01:36:35.580" style="s2">the thinking is ultimately grounded in</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.510" end="01:36:37.320" style="s2">the thinking Mary Cohen said something</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.580" end="01:36:38.550" style="s2">similar to me which she said well</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.320" end="01:36:40.050" style="s2">because I&#39;ve asked the question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.550" end="01:36:42.360" style="s2">saying what is it in your phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.050" end="01:36:43.440" style="s2">that calls you towards a personification</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.360" end="01:36:45.449" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.440" end="01:36:47.250" style="s2">the sacred and and she and because I</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.449" end="01:36:48.960" style="s2">said you know I&#39;ve had these mystical</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.250" end="01:36:51.930" style="s2">experiences and wisdom and self</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.960" end="01:36:53.070" style="s2">transcendence and she said and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.930" end="01:36:54.360" style="s2">had a chance to respond her about that</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.070" end="01:36:55.739" style="s2">cuz in our three-way dialogue we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.360" end="01:36:58.219" style="s2">get to it but she said to me she said</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.739" end="01:36:59.670" style="s2">well I think one of the for the deep</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.219" end="01:37:03.140" style="s2">phenomenological things we need to</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.670" end="01:37:05.610" style="s2">address is gratitude and that gratitude</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.140" end="01:37:08.100" style="s2">puts us into the being mode and puts us</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.610" end="01:37:09.360" style="s2">into a relationship I have a practice</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.100" end="01:37:13.380" style="s2">every day is in the Oakland atonic</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.360" end="01:37:15.750" style="s2">practice where I think that I think the</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.380" end="01:37:17.430" style="s2">physical aspects of being because as I</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.750" end="01:37:19.469" style="s2">say I do not make them I emerge from</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.430" end="01:37:20.940" style="s2">them to participate in them I think the</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.469" end="01:37:23.460" style="s2">intelligible aspects because I do not</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.940" end="01:37:27.150" style="s2">make them I emerge them from them right</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.460" end="01:37:31.190" style="s2">I think the vital aspects that and so I</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.150" end="01:37:33.870" style="s2">that I think all these aspects because I</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.190" end="01:37:36.030" style="s2">they are ultimately presupposed by me</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.870" end="01:37:40.020" style="s2">they are the grammar that makes the</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.030" end="01:37:42.770" style="s2">trans gentle and so so I&#39;m always I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.020" end="01:37:45.540" style="s2">always expressing gratitude towards them</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.770" end="01:37:48.239" style="s2">because as I say in my little ritual I</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.540" end="01:37:50.489" style="s2">emerge and I actually say to put it to</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.239" end="01:37:52.590" style="s2">bring it all the way around I say I am</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.489" end="01:37:55.020" style="s2">grateful like for the intelligible</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.590" end="01:37:59.100" style="s2">because I did not make it I emerge from</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.020" end="01:38:01.530" style="s2">it to participate and trust in it and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.100" end="01:38:04.410" style="s2">that so the gratitude and the trusting</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.530" end="01:38:07.440" style="s2">and all of that stuff come together yes</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.410" end="01:38:10.020" style="s2">so I&#39;m just I&#39;m just wondering go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.440" end="01:38:11.489" style="s2">go ahead just speaking of thinking I</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.020" end="01:38:14.130" style="s2">just realized we&#39;ve been going for about</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.489" end="01:38:22.500" style="s2">hour and 45 minutes and I asked what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.130" end="01:38:24.600" style="s2">officially late for a meeting - I just I</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.500" end="01:38:27.860" style="s2">just wanted to say that like this is I</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.600" end="01:38:30.090" style="s2">love the place that this this is</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.860" end="01:38:32.910" style="s2">completing in its unfinished nests</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.090" end="01:38:37.290" style="s2">because I I can just tell this is part</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.910" end="01:38:39.449" style="s2">of this is that just like just like as</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.290" end="01:38:42.030" style="s2">Bateson would say the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.449" end="01:38:44.969" style="s2">a blockbuster movie and an artful movie</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.030" end="01:38:48.060" style="s2">is a blockbuster movie like crescendo</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.969" end="01:38:49.739" style="s2">you know like peak crescendo climax you</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.060" end="01:38:52.050" style="s2">walk in one way you go through that you</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.739" end="01:38:55.469" style="s2">walk out exactly the same an artful</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.050" end="01:38:56.730" style="s2">movie is one in which it it arrives as</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.469" end="01:38:59.520" style="s2">tensions that</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.730" end="01:39:01.590" style="s2">never fully complete and that you walk</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.520" end="01:39:04.500" style="s2">in one way and you walk out with these</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.590" end="01:39:07.530" style="s2">existential there&#39;s not a lot to call</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.500" end="01:39:10.140" style="s2">tensions that you you work out in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.530" end="01:39:12.060" style="s2">enactment of your life and I literally</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.140" end="01:39:13.680" style="s2">this is I could just tell this</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.060" end="01:39:15.840" style="s2">distinction in this question that we&#39;re</p>
