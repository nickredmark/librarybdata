<p begin="00:00:02.580" end="00:00:08.970" style="s2">studies primarily sort of a mix of</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.620" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">specializing in Buddhist studies and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:14.670" style="s2">Islamic studies obviously my talk with</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:16.440" style="s2">John was much more on the the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.670" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">side of things focusing in on on</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.440" end="00:00:23.539" style="s2">nishitani but yeah I&#39;d connected with</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:27.029" style="s2">John a couple months back when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.539" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">organized a discussion between him and</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.029" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">Tom Cheetham who does does work on Enric</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">or bong so more on the Islamic side of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">things there and we&#39;d also had a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:42.590" style="s2">bit of talk over email about nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">as at the time I was I was leading a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.590" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">discussion group through Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:51.660" style="s2">Tunney&#39;s religion and nothingness so</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:54.690" style="s2">yeah I wants John started up his his</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:56.910" style="s2">voices with Reiki series I figured I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.690" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">would reach out to him and see if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.910" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">could dig into this text considering it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">was such an impactful one for for both</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">of us so yeah I discuss inflate really</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">well I&#39;m really happy with with how it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">went as I mean just the the materials</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">relating to new sheet Ani online</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">especially in video form right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">very very specialized stuff like like</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">add students giving giving various</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:28.860" style="s2">papers on like a Descartes and new sheet</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">on ease thought and how his</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.860" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">interpretation it&#39;s really covered by</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">Heidegger or something so very</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">high-level stuff that someone like just</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:41.000" style="s2">just getting into the text would would</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:44.729" style="s2">feel quite lost trying to bring to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.000" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">tackle so yeah the the discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.729" end="00:01:50.820" style="s2">John we really kind of followed the arc</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">of the the text really not not very</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.820" end="00:01:55.369" style="s2">intentionally it just kind of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">happened that way which was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.369" end="00:02:01.790" style="s2">so yeah it was it was really exciting to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">sort of cover these these different</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.790" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">concepts and at least be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">introduce them to an audience so they</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">can dip their feet in a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">see if they might want to explore deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:15.830" style="s2">with some of this kyoto school</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:15.830" style="s2">Southie</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:20.470" style="s2">let me ask you what what you know John</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.970" end="00:02:24.210" style="s2">is called it&#39;s one of the three most</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.470" end="00:02:27.700" style="s2">influential books you know what makes a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.210" end="00:02:30.700" style="s2">philosophy book that powerful like what</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.700" end="00:02:36.850" style="s2">is it about this book that that you both</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.700" end="00:02:40.540" style="s2">Revere so much I think just speaking for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.850" end="00:02:44.500" style="s2">myself it&#39;s it&#39;s how he&#39;s able to like</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.540" end="00:02:49.480" style="s2">weave together different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.500" end="00:02:53.140" style="s2">discourse so excellently I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.480" end="00:02:56.230" style="s2">certainly a history of philosophy texts</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.140" end="00:02:58.570" style="s2">in some important ways and that ego goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.230" end="00:03:02.530" style="s2">through various philosophical figures</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.570" end="00:03:05.530" style="s2">and levels critiques and shows how</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.530" end="00:03:09.130" style="s2">interpretations have sort of built on</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.530" end="00:03:12.820" style="s2">top of one another but it&#39;s always also</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.130" end="00:03:15.640" style="s2">at the same time through that speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.820" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">very pertinently to to an existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.640" end="00:03:23.080" style="s2">level of our own experience and some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:26.230" style="s2">these fundamentals that we hit up</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.080" end="00:03:29.410" style="s2">against in life and and so it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.230" end="00:03:32.440" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a paradox in that like my</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.410" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">own students if you want to call down as</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:37.000" style="s2">we were going through this text we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">constantly wondering like what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.000" end="00:03:42.100" style="s2">the like pertinence of this what&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">the practical value and I saw that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.100" end="00:03:48.040" style="s2">some of the YouTube comments as well but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:51.450" style="s2">somehow even though it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.040" end="00:03:55.420" style="s2">this so abstract level there really is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.450" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">it really speaks to some of the core and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.420" end="00:04:04.600" style="s2">the depths of human experience and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:07.810" style="s2">it reads it reads like a meditation in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.600" end="00:04:11.350" style="s2">you know in a deep sense and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.810" end="00:04:14.019" style="s2">sometimes as like a Zen Cohen and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.350" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">how he&#39;s able to to weave all those</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.019" end="00:04:20.169" style="s2">levels together and and state something</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">profound and historical about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.169" end="00:04:25.180" style="s2">developments in philosophy while also</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:28.539" style="s2">like speaking like to you and in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.180" end="00:04:30.249" style="s2">own deepest being is is is really really</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.539" end="00:04:31.719" style="s2">something unique a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.249" end="00:04:33.540" style="s2">have been found in other philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.719" end="00:04:35.340" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.540" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">right so when I was one more</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.340" end="00:04:40.680" style="s2">introductory question then I&#39;ll pass it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">to two others but you talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.680" end="00:04:46.500" style="s2">nihilism and the hill of tea in the talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">can you just give us a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.500" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">nihilism and Elodie</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:59.990" style="s2">yeah the the easiest way to perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.620" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">conceptualize these things ahilla D</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.990" end="00:05:07.010" style="s2">especially is is just like the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:09.470" style="s2">finite aspect of things the that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.010" end="00:05:12.020" style="s2">of like death and decay that is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.470" end="00:05:14.390" style="s2">always comes along with the the being</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.020" end="00:05:17.060" style="s2">the existence the the substance of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.390" end="00:05:21.530" style="s2">thing so I mean you can&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.060" end="00:05:24.620" style="s2">object that also won&#39;t be falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.530" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">and in in some sense as it as it moves</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.620" end="00:05:32.360" style="s2">through time so ility really just refers</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:37.580" style="s2">to this pervasive aspect of experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.360" end="00:05:39.560" style="s2">that an existence that everything is has</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.580" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">it at its at its ground there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.560" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">not you can&#39;t find something that is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">in some way connected to this ahilla T</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:55.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like the as as death is to life</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:59.960" style="s2">Hilla T is to being and so so nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.790" end="00:06:04.910" style="s2">is really just the personal</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.960" end="00:06:08.030" style="s2">psychological standpoint of really being</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.910" end="00:06:10.460" style="s2">existentially aware of the this field of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.030" end="00:06:15.170" style="s2">ahilla T and being sort of caught and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.460" end="00:06:17.660" style="s2">it&#39;s in its grasp so to speak and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.170" end="00:06:19.550" style="s2">of a lot of the time we hear about we</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.660" end="00:06:22.130" style="s2">hear people refer to nihilism and sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.550" end="00:06:23.720" style="s2">of a derogatory or negative you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.130" end="00:06:26.770" style="s2">negative way you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:29.380" style="s2">intrinsically negative</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:32.260" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a great question for</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.380" end="00:06:35.200" style="s2">nishitani it is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.260" end="00:06:39.670" style="s2">intrinsically negative in that it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.200" end="00:06:45.330" style="s2">just an aspect of existence like like</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.670" end="00:06:48.610" style="s2">being itself is but the the human being</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.330" end="00:06:54.070" style="s2">staying stuck on the standpoint of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.610" end="00:06:56.620" style="s2">nihility and nihilism that is a limiting</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.070" end="00:07:00.010" style="s2">situation and and one which comes with</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.620" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">with negatives so the progression</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.010" end="00:07:06.100" style="s2">through this this nihilism this field of</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:08.910" style="s2">nihility is is something that that ought</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.100" end="00:07:11.770" style="s2">to be undertaken so that we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.910" end="00:07:15.510" style="s2">integrated standpoint of Shunyata our</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.770" end="00:07:19.630" style="s2">emptiness where ahilla tea and being</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.510" end="00:07:23.080" style="s2">codependence and co-existence are really</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.630" end="00:07:28.600" style="s2">really allowed to come forth both within</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.080" end="00:07:32.350" style="s2">our own viewpoint but also through that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.600" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">like ontological e in the world as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.350" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">this - twofold term of realization that</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you apprehend</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:43.720" style="s2">personally but it also becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:46.290" style="s2">actualized in in the world there as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.720" end="00:07:46.290" style="s2">have pretended</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">all right well thanks so let me turn it</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.970" end="00:07:54.849" style="s2">to two questions so who so I ask people</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:57.639" style="s2">to you know just I think it went well</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.849" end="00:07:59.889" style="s2">with with John&#39;s talk so you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.639" end="00:08:01.810" style="s2">sort of first come first serve and if</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.889" end="00:08:03.819" style="s2">you hear someone talking you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.810" end="00:08:04.990" style="s2">let them go first I think we have a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.819" end="00:08:08.199" style="s2">enough people that everyone should have</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.990" end="00:08:11.080" style="s2">have time to ask ask their question so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.199" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">so go ahead who has it who has something</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.080" end="00:08:13.470" style="s2">to ask</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.470" end="00:08:21.310" style="s2">don&#39;t be afraid well I guess I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.650" end="00:08:22.750" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.310" end="00:08:25.450" style="s2">I actually wrote out this question and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.750" end="00:08:31.450" style="s2">then if you saw it early or not but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.450" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">is why does nishitani I understand his</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.450" end="00:08:36.070" style="s2">criticism of Aristotle and substance and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.430" end="00:08:37.570" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of agree with it but my</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.070" end="00:08:41.380" style="s2">question is why is he going off to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.570" end="00:08:43.930" style="s2">Aristotle and not say Parmenides is he</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.380" end="00:08:45.820" style="s2">getting I think Heidegger made more</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.930" end="00:08:48.090" style="s2">religious a move and I&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.820" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">the mission to get it from Heidegger or</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.090" end="00:08:53.110" style="s2">is there something else behind it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.110" end="00:09:00.310" style="s2">hey I would be inclined to say yes that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:03.610" style="s2">this is a as a Haida garyun influence in</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.310" end="00:09:06.370" style="s2">his thinking here yeah it is the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:10.450" style="s2">same with his reading of Descartes is</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.370" end="00:09:13.500" style="s2">definitely indebted to Heidegger in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.450" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">terms of why he makes that specific move</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.500" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">that is the good question</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:22.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I know enough about</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:27.370" style="s2">Parmenides to give a particularly robust</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.690" end="00:09:31.630" style="s2">answer my my intuition is is perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.370" end="00:09:37.240" style="s2">just that Aristotle&#39;s such a such a big</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.630" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">named thinker and so many so much of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.240" end="00:09:42.940" style="s2">Western philosophy really directly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:47.260" style="s2">indirectly goes back to Aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.940" end="00:09:50.680" style="s2">has built off of Aristotle and so even</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.260" end="00:09:52.840" style="s2">if he might not be the like pinnacle of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.680" end="00:09:56.890" style="s2">substance thinking and in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.840" end="00:10:01.480" style="s2">Parmenides might be he his impact with</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.890" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">that style of philosophizing has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.480" end="00:10:10.450" style="s2">very pervasive and so the decision to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:14.230" style="s2">go towards Aristotelian ism I think has</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.450" end="00:10:16.900" style="s2">more to do with trying to speak to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.230" end="00:10:19.330" style="s2">of the very foundations of Western</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.900" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">philosophical thinking rather than</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.330" end="00:10:27.940" style="s2">trying to tackle this idea of substance</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:30.700" style="s2">and perhaps its most mature form if that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.940" end="00:10:31.270" style="s2">if that makes sense because he weaves in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.700" end="00:10:35.560" style="s2">a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.270" end="00:10:38.110" style="s2">ideas from different thinkers especially</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.560" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">in terms of like nihilism melody or</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.110" end="00:10:45.310" style="s2">nothingness he he goes over Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:49.450" style="s2">Heidegger Sartre all in in quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.310" end="00:10:53.260" style="s2">of detail and so really really what he</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.450" end="00:10:54.910" style="s2">is trying to do is look at the the arc</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.260" end="00:10:58.350" style="s2">and the development of Western</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.910" end="00:11:02.380" style="s2">philosophical thinking and and critique</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.350" end="00:11:06.780" style="s2">where things haven&#39;t haven&#39;t lived up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.380" end="00:11:09.580" style="s2">his vision of emptiness or Shunyata and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.780" end="00:11:13.780" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s one of the really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.580" end="00:11:17.380" style="s2">foundational figures in in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.780" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">arc that he&#39;s looking at okay thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.380" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">the answer I might as a candidate</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:24.160" style="s2">explanation just offer the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:28.150" style="s2">don&#39;t really have much of Perlman ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.160" end="00:11:29.950" style="s2">left right you know so people we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.150" end="00:11:32.770" style="s2">fragments but you know they say he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.950" end="00:11:34.210" style="s2">the first MIT position hmm I think one</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.770" end="00:11:37.390" style="s2">of the books at Vevey ki recommended</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.210" end="00:11:41.140" style="s2">even you know what it&#39;s at Erik Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.390" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2">book on metaphysics explicitly you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.140" end="00:11:45.790" style="s2">it makes that claim for example yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:47.530" style="s2">well the one question that I would have</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.790" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">been in that regard I mean we do have</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.530" end="00:11:53.980" style="s2">good records of Plato for example and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">can you speak to how Plato would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.980" end="00:11:56.920" style="s2">different from Aristotle in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.380" style="s2">substance is that something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.920" end="00:12:03.100" style="s2">familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.380" end="00:12:07.810" style="s2">yeah I&#39;d say nishitani is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.100" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">more aligned with Plato than Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.810" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2">philosophically the the Platonic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">form or I das even though it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.400" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">still a more of a being notion of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">constitutes the identity of a thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not as materialized in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:34.690" style="s2">the same way that that Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:37.900" style="s2">substance vision is materialized might</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.690" end="00:12:40.990" style="s2">not be quite the right word for this but</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.900" end="00:12:42.820" style="s2">well it sounds to me like you&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.990" end="00:12:44.990" style="s2">referring to the differences in realism</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.820" end="00:12:46.640" style="s2">because latronnik realism you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.990" end="00:12:49.430" style="s2">it was the generator was not the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.640" end="00:12:51.770" style="s2">particular yes it was the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.430" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">well I kind of got like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.770" end="00:12:56.060" style="s2">hint from the way that you inve key were</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:12:58.250" style="s2">talking to each other about Misha Tony&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.060" end="00:13:00.050" style="s2">emphasis on the individual because it</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.250" end="00:13:03.980" style="s2">sounds like there&#39;s a similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.050" end="00:13:05.720" style="s2">tension going on there yeah yeah just</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.980" end="00:13:07.459" style="s2">can I ask you that though for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.720" end="00:13:09.050" style="s2">benefit of everyone can can you like</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.459" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">define some of these terms as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.050" end="00:13:11.990" style="s2">going through them just very briefly so</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:14.330" style="s2">everybody can sort of be on the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.990" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">page with where you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.330" end="00:13:21.380" style="s2">great yeah so the the big term to keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:24.230" style="s2">in mind here with nishitani is that of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.380" end="00:13:28.420" style="s2">Shunyata it&#39;s a Sanskrit term that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.230" end="00:13:31.250" style="s2">most oftenly translated as emptiness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.420" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really at the the core of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.250" end="00:13:39.050" style="s2">his his philosophy here so this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:41.510" style="s2">Shunyata and then in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.050" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">Platonic philosophy that we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.510" end="00:13:47.720" style="s2">getting into now we have the notion of I</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:50.270" style="s2">das or or forms as if that is often</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.720" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">translated and ver Vicki talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.270" end="00:13:56.029" style="s2">this a couple times in his meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">crisis series but yeah this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.029" end="00:14:00.850" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:06.010" style="s2">a world of forms</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.850" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a metaphysical reality where the</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.010" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">sort of ideal essence of a thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:20.990" style="s2">is realized so like you have the I das</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:23.630" style="s2">of chair in this world of forms that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.990" end="00:14:26.930" style="s2">sort of the the archetype of chair Ness</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.630" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">so to speak and so in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.930" end="00:14:34.670" style="s2">philosophy of Plato compared to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:37.720" style="s2">Aristotle you you have a I mean a more</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.670" end="00:14:40.450" style="s2">hierarchical vision of reality versus</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.720" end="00:14:44.690" style="s2">considering things more in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.450" end="00:14:48.470" style="s2">material particulars and a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.690" end="00:14:52.040" style="s2">defined not so much in terms of its its</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.470" end="00:14:55.779" style="s2">own substance or like materiality but</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.040" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">more in in relation to this more</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:10.430" style="s2">of a form of an eye dose so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.250" end="00:15:15.380" style="s2">nishitani x&#39; critique aristotle just he</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:17.690" style="s2">he locates the the being of things much</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.380" end="00:15:23.450" style="s2">more in this in this materiality much</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.690" end="00:15:28.760" style="s2">more in this particular ality in a way</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.450" end="00:15:32.270" style="s2">that that takes us away from meeting</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.760" end="00:15:34.970" style="s2">things on on their own home ground so to</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.270" end="00:15:37.460" style="s2">speak in nishitani x&#39; language there</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.970" end="00:15:41.630" style="s2">where as the Platonic conception here</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.460" end="00:15:44.710" style="s2">has a little bit more of of that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.630" end="00:15:44.710" style="s2">ability left in it</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.139" end="00:15:51.810" style="s2">great think does anyone else have</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.350" end="00:16:12.430" style="s2">okay well I&#39;ll throw another one so</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:15.220" style="s2">certainly you know what</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.430" end="00:16:18.670" style="s2">what does meaningless mean so as</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:21.820" style="s2">conscious intelligent beings it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.670" end="00:16:24.580" style="s2">me that what we&#39;re sort of we have we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.820" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">meaning generating by our by our nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.580" end="00:16:29.020" style="s2">now maybe not universal meaning in terms</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.020" end="00:16:34.030" style="s2">having meaning but it it seems that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:36.520" style="s2">always should have meaning if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.030" end="00:16:41.320" style="s2">understanding each other for if we have</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.750" end="00:19:48.190" style="s2">meaning to come in to its its real</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.110" end="00:19:51.580" style="s2">essence and it&#39;s it&#39;s not an essence</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.580" end="00:19:57.130" style="s2">meaninglessness but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:20:01.240" end="00:20:05.740" style="s2">more like a practical example that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.450" end="00:20:08.020" style="s2">take the example of the grandfather</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.740" end="00:20:09.400" style="s2">Diane like you know you have this life</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.020" end="00:20:10.930" style="s2">with this grandfather I mean you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.400" end="00:20:12.310" style="s2">your moments you&#39;ve had your</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.930" end="00:20:14.740" style="s2">relationship so obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.310" end="00:20:17.950" style="s2">meaning there but okay so so he dies</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.740" end="00:20:21.400" style="s2">what are the thoughts that represent</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.950" end="00:20:25.930" style="s2">what you&#39;ve just described mm-hmm so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.400" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">death itself would be a sub sub specie</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.930" end="00:20:31.450" style="s2">of nihility it&#39;s a kind of nobility the</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:34.149" style="s2">the being of this person has been</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.450" end="00:20:35.829" style="s2">nullified by this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.149" end="00:20:40.989" style="s2">experience of death their life is</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.829" end="00:20:45.999" style="s2">nullified so I mean that has a lot a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.989" end="00:20:48.449" style="s2">of consequences in terms of how we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.999" end="00:20:52.209" style="s2">able to psychologically and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.449" end="00:20:56.739" style="s2">existentially relate because we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.209" end="00:21:00.809" style="s2">much in this in this mindset of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.739" end="00:21:05.949" style="s2">being fully dependent on on on being or</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.809" end="00:21:08.979" style="s2">substance so it I mean just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.949" end="00:21:13.359" style="s2">how a grief would would naturally</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.979" end="00:21:18.429" style="s2">proceed perhaps you would have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.359" end="00:21:20.499" style="s2">of deep regrets that you weren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.429" end="00:21:24.219" style="s2">express something or weren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.499" end="00:21:28.329" style="s2">have fully taken advantage of of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.219" end="00:21:31.149" style="s2">relationship or that you never were able</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.329" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">to realize a certain project you had</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.149" end="00:21:38.099" style="s2">together or something so these these</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:40.689" style="s2">meanings there seemed to be nullified</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.099" end="00:21:44.949" style="s2">through the death because this being</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.689" end="00:21:48.099" style="s2">aspect that we had banked all of all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.949" end="00:21:51.129" style="s2">our meaning on has vanished through</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.099" end="00:21:55.209" style="s2">through death there and so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.129" end="00:21:59.229" style="s2">a very natural response because of our</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.209" end="00:22:03.189" style="s2">our situation of having being and this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.229" end="00:22:05.979" style="s2">this field of consciousness be really</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.189" end="00:22:09.609" style="s2">the dynamic that that we have in terms</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.979" end="00:22:12.729" style="s2">of how we how we construct meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.609" end="00:22:17.649" style="s2">how we cultivate meaning so then then</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.729" end="00:22:22.569" style="s2">finally getting to Juniata we enter into</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.649" end="00:22:25.629" style="s2">a standpoint where it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.569" end="00:22:27.519" style="s2">incredibly hard to explain and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.629" end="00:22:29.619" style="s2">this is this is what a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.519" end="00:22:31.779" style="s2">would probably criticize nishitani for</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.619" end="00:22:37.049" style="s2">in terms of like what&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.779" end="00:22:39.789" style="s2">practical value of this conversion so I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.049" end="00:22:44.429" style="s2">I&#39;m not positive that I&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.789" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">quite do it justice ad-libbing here but</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.429" end="00:22:50.590" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:55.539" style="s2">you are able to recognize that any any</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.590" end="00:22:58.350" style="s2">moment that you did have an any meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.539" end="00:23:02.770" style="s2">that did arise</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.350" end="00:23:07.120" style="s2">it was already like a rising from the</p>

<p begin="00:23:07.120" end="00:23:14.309" style="s2">colored by this this meaninglessness yet</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.650" end="00:23:16.930" style="s2">it was actually the meaninglessness that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.309" end="00:23:20.890" style="s2">allowed these meanings to arise in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.930" end="00:23:23.470" style="s2">first place it was the fact that your</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.890" end="00:23:27.820" style="s2">grandfather was this particular finite</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.470" end="00:23:30.700" style="s2">limited person that and and also the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.820" end="00:23:34.210" style="s2">fact that you were also this particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.700" end="00:23:39.790" style="s2">finite limited person who was able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.210" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">enter into relationship at all and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.790" end="00:23:48.790" style="s2">connect at all that I mean those those</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:53.110" style="s2">meanings are in a sense more robust than</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.790" end="00:23:57.880" style="s2">than any nihility could could undermine</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.110" end="00:24:02.760" style="s2">they did exist they will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.880" end="00:24:05.559" style="s2">exist and there in us in a sense almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.760" end="00:24:08.340" style="s2">indestructible like once you once you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.559" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">get to a perspective that that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.340" end="00:24:17.530" style="s2">integrates the two of being and an</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:21.179" style="s2">agility and are able to see how the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.530" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">meaning is is really this codependent</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.179" end="00:24:26.860" style="s2">arising from from the both of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:30.130" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s when you&#39;re able to shift</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.860" end="00:24:33.610" style="s2">to this this deep sense of of gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.130" end="00:24:38.410" style="s2">for for the grandfather and for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.610" end="00:24:44.260" style="s2">relationship and be able to meet that on</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.260" end="00:24:50.679" style="s2">it anyway in in terms of like your field</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.590" end="00:24:53.830" style="s2">of cognition in like terms of evaluating</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.679" end="00:24:56.290" style="s2">it on to the extent that it brought you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.830" end="00:24:58.570" style="s2">pleasure or evaluating it on the extent</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:06.550" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.820" end="00:25:09.540" style="s2">complicated dynamic there and nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.550" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">himself does not get into a single</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.540" end="00:25:17.410" style="s2">concrete example of this sort in his</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:20.050" style="s2">whole nearly 300 page text here so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.410" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">I mean you really have to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.050" end="00:25:23.400" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:27.270" style="s2">and try and figure out some of these</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.730" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">thought about value and meaning of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.760" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">finite life is we tend to think sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.830" end="00:25:39.540" style="s2">in economic terms the more rare</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:43.860" style="s2">something is the more valuable we tend</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.540" end="00:25:45.810" style="s2">to to ascribe it so having a finite life</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.860" end="00:25:48.180" style="s2">makes each moment that much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.810" end="00:25:53.310" style="s2">valuable if if we had an infinite life</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.180" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">each moment would be you know relatively</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.310" end="00:26:00.300" style="s2">less valuable in in that right sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">along the lines that nishitani is</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.300" end="00:26:05.340" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.050" end="00:26:20.510" style="s2">and that&#39;s why he attacks things on</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.140" end="00:26:23.280" style="s2">these terms of de cartes cogito or</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.510" end="00:26:27.030" style="s2">Aristotelian notions of substance or</p>

<p begin="00:27:06.030" end="00:27:10.560" style="s2">absolutely and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.970" end="00:27:14.520" style="s2">difficult to explain</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.560" end="00:27:18.990" style="s2">mmm-hmm you know I find Jeff Foster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.520" end="00:27:21.990" style="s2">book an extraordinary absence wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.990" end="00:27:24.920" style="s2">for a beginner looking into what a non</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.990" end="00:27:27.780" style="s2">dual perspective might be he has</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.920" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">narrative where he&#39;s describing his own</p>

<p begin="00:27:33.780" end="00:27:39.090" style="s2">door he hears something knocking he goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.510" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">over he&#39;s right there he opens the door</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.090" end="00:27:42.670" style="s2">he&#39;s in that mom</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.120" end="00:27:45.250" style="s2">what happens and then he switches this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.670" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">year you know so he really that book I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.250" end="00:27:51.550" style="s2">like a lot and you know these concepts</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:54.010" style="s2">that are true you know perhaps you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.550" end="00:27:55.840" style="s2">some work cut out for you because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.010" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">need to be able to explain these to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.840" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">people even at a sixth grade level</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:28:04.870" style="s2">because it is true yeah but to have</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:10.450" style="s2">concrete examples you know it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.870" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">me that and I haven&#39;t read him I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.450" end="00:28:14.620" style="s2">want to read the other three books you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:19.420" style="s2">guys or John did suggest we read first</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.620" end="00:28:23.590" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering that book I did the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.420" end="00:28:24.970" style="s2">self overcoming nihilism that is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.590" end="00:28:29.290" style="s2">easier book to read</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.970" end="00:28:33.040" style="s2">I have not tackled that one so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.290" end="00:28:36.250" style="s2">comment with any sort of authority just</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.040" end="00:28:40.660" style="s2">just scanning over it it seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.250" end="00:28:45.820" style="s2">bit more of a philosophical treatise and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.660" end="00:28:48.310" style="s2">not not quite this this deeply infused</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.820" end="00:28:51.430" style="s2">existential word that religion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.310" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">nothingness is but I&#39;m sure it covers</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.430" end="00:28:59.620" style="s2">some of the same ideas especially as as</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:29:03.610" style="s2">relating to Tannehill &#39;ti and you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.620" end="00:29:06.970" style="s2">if we all think about it we&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.610" end="00:29:10.060" style="s2">experience you speak of you know where</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.970" end="00:29:13.060" style="s2">we feel like the ground of being pulled</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.060" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">out from under it and and we have that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.060" end="00:29:18.580" style="s2">loss but it&#39;s a scary feeling</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.690" end="00:29:20.260" style="s2">nothingness is sort of scary but then</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.580" end="00:29:23.470" style="s2">you pick yourself up and you start</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.260" end="00:29:24.910" style="s2">deciding what has meaning again how you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.470" end="00:29:27.790" style="s2">can look at your life in a different</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.910" end="00:29:29.770" style="s2">perspective so you go to that you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.790" end="00:29:32.140" style="s2">jump off the cliff and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.770" end="00:29:33.850" style="s2">where you can land and you don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.140" end="00:29:35.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a bottom down there or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.850" end="00:29:40.600" style="s2">but yeah but you get to a point I know</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.830" end="00:29:44.620" style="s2">in my own times of that that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.600" end="00:29:49.570" style="s2">take that jump and that was the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.620" end="00:29:54.840" style="s2">that I had corn you I think about minute</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.570" end="00:29:59.289" style="s2">26 you and John were speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.840" end="00:30:02.590" style="s2">absurdity and meaninglessness and how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.289" end="00:30:06.340" style="s2">have to you know actually embrace that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.590" end="00:30:09.700" style="s2">to go any farther we have to experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.340" end="00:30:11.649" style="s2">the whole oneness of existence which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.700" end="00:30:13.899" style="s2">the nothingness and the incredible</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.649" end="00:30:15.960" style="s2">somethingness and you know John gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.899" end="00:30:18.669" style="s2">talking about the session as&#39; and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.960" end="00:30:20.890" style="s2">Cygnus and all this stuff and I get what</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.669" end="00:30:22.779" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about but anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.890" end="00:30:25.240" style="s2">wondered you know because you&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.779" end="00:30:29.409" style="s2">this exploration for a while if you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.240" end="00:30:32.440" style="s2">any personal experience with it is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.409" end="00:30:34.779" style="s2">existential process you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.440" end="00:30:35.720" style="s2">surrender I mean our ego does not want</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.779" end="00:30:37.350" style="s2">to let go</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.720" end="00:30:41.090" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.350" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.090" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">one one important point I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">especially bringing in this this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:50.669" style="s2">language of absurdity that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:54.990" style="s2">particularly relevant to the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.669" end="00:30:58.139" style="s2">century existentialist yeah he initially</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.990" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">Thani levels a pretty extensive critique</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.139" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">against Sartre and I think it&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:07.950" style="s2">2:00 and and his existentialism he says</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:11.340" style="s2">he he gets a lot of things right in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.950" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">terms of the encounter with nihilism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.340" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">the hill adiy and how this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:21.000" style="s2">the the ground for a freedom in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:25.289" style="s2">to make meaning but his critique is</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.000" end="00:31:29.000" style="s2">really that Sartre is still really</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.289" end="00:31:32.669" style="s2">operating on this Cartesian field of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.000" end="00:31:35.940" style="s2">cogito so it&#39;s it&#39;s always still related</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.669" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">back to the self for the self that these</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.940" end="00:31:43.080" style="s2">meanings are that come out of absurd</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">absurd ISM and so what nishitani really</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.080" end="00:31:50.009" style="s2">wants instead is is to show that even</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:53.190" style="s2">even the self itself it has an ahilla t</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.009" end="00:31:57.029" style="s2">as its as its ground and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.190" end="00:32:00.149" style="s2">taken as any kind of fundamental center</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.029" end="00:32:03.990" style="s2">any more than these things in the in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.149" end="00:32:08.669" style="s2">way not there yeah not there we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.990" end="00:32:11.220" style="s2">created this concept we have right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.669" end="00:32:14.039" style="s2">and as a very zen buddhist thinker and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.220" end="00:32:17.669" style="s2">he&#39;s drawing on the tradition there of</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.039" end="00:32:20.100" style="s2">no self and in Buddhism and but his</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.669" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">exploration of it is is very novel in</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.100" end="00:32:25.379" style="s2">terms of how he weaves in so much of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">Western philosophical thought and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.379" end="00:32:31.590" style="s2">integrates that he&#39;s not just rehashing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:35.490" style="s2">some some Buddhist talking points or</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.590" end="00:32:38.759" style="s2">metaphysics in this domain he really is</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.490" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">doing something quite quite unique</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.759" end="00:32:44.970" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s one of his sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">explanations is that the self as the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.970" end="00:32:50.129" style="s2">self as we take it is is always like</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.159" end="00:32:51.299" style="s2">bound up within itself and it bases its</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.129" end="00:32:54.330" style="s2">value on it</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.299" end="00:32:57.330" style="s2">self and so this this sort of self</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.330" end="00:33:02.519" style="s2">enclosure of the self is is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.330" end="00:33:05.789" style="s2">one of the major sort of points of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.519" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">nihility arising because we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.789" end="00:33:12.600" style="s2">this integrated flow with the world and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:14.999" style="s2">instead always binding ourselves up</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.600" end="00:33:17.850" style="s2">within ourselves and trying to base our</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.999" end="00:33:21.779" style="s2">ourself and our life on this this finite</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.850" end="00:33:24.480" style="s2">thing that we&#39;ve somehow taken as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.779" end="00:33:28.049" style="s2">fundamental that that&#39;s really where a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.480" end="00:33:32.460" style="s2">lot of this dynamic of ahilla t is able</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.049" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">to to come out from since since if we if</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.460" end="00:33:38.700" style="s2">we had this this much more non-dual kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:40.799" style="s2">of a basis for things i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.700" end="00:33:43.289" style="s2">it&#39;s there you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.799" end="00:33:47.159" style="s2">is is going through its its phases and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.289" end="00:33:50.369" style="s2">and and marching forth and that&#39;s sort</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.280" end="00:35:41.990" style="s2">non-dual field and in many ways it felt</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.370" end="00:35:44.270" style="s2">like well quite quite accurately exiting</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.990" end="00:35:48.230" style="s2">the world of substance and instead kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.270" end="00:35:50.510" style="s2">of entering almost this context this web</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.830" end="00:36:03.070" style="s2">and when I had it it was kind of hoisted</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.260" end="00:36:06.890" style="s2">on me it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t right through</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.890" end="00:36:16.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting rate I found that a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.769" end="00:36:18.319" style="s2">incredibly transformative experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.190" end="00:36:22.850" style="s2">this was quite a long time ago probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.319" end="00:36:28.820" style="s2">when I was 23 or so</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.850" end="00:36:31.430" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is I I had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.820" end="00:36:34.090" style="s2">later date had another rather intense</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.430" end="00:36:37.400" style="s2">experience where it felt like I was</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.400" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">suddenly there was almost a a</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:47.510" style="s2">realization that the peak of non-duality</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:53.300" style="s2">is two in some sent consent to duality</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.510" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s choosing which almost allowed</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.240" end="00:37:13.610" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering so I kind of have two</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.120" end="00:37:16.190" style="s2">questions here one is that part of I</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.610" end="00:37:19.580" style="s2">might also add that brought me back to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.190" end="00:37:24.740" style="s2">more Western religious perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.580" end="00:37:28.460" style="s2">and kind of kicked me out of the perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.740" end="00:37:31.460" style="s2">wrongly on on my end stated goal of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.460" end="00:37:36.230" style="s2">Eastern philosophies it might have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.460" end="00:37:39.230" style="s2">a lack of understanding but is that part</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.230" end="00:37:41.960" style="s2">of nishitani x&#39; work in that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.230" end="00:37:46.760" style="s2">kind of not so much entering into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:49.940" style="s2">non-dual field as a type of we might say</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.570" end="00:38:00.170" style="s2">you guys hinted towards his very deep</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.900" end="00:38:19.700" style="s2">yeah your your intuition is is totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:21.799" style="s2">spot-on here in terms of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:25.369" style="s2">project nishitani is doing and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.799" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">of experience that he&#39;s really hinting</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.369" end="00:38:32.869" style="s2">at one of the unique languages he uses</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:34.520" style="s2">to describe this stuff is is the far</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.869" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">side and the near side and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.520" end="00:38:39.319" style="s2">related to like imminence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:43.460" style="s2">transcendence and so on the on the field</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.319" end="00:38:45.619" style="s2">of Juniata it&#39;s this final goal which I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.460" end="00:38:48.230" style="s2">mean speaking of it as a goal is already</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.619" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">framing it in this field of cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.230" end="00:38:53.900" style="s2">we&#39;re already off but right we can we</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">can do that too hint and in the right</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.900" end="00:39:00.380" style="s2">right direction here but the the field</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:03.619" style="s2">of Shunyata he describes as the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.380" end="00:39:06.619" style="s2">near side so it&#39;s it&#39;s the more of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.619" end="00:39:10.849" style="s2">near side to ourselves than the self</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.619" end="00:39:13.069" style="s2">itself so when we are in our selves and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.849" end="00:39:16.579" style="s2">bound up in ourselves as we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.069" end="00:39:19.369" style="s2">describing in some way were were</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.579" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">divorced from ourselves because we have</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:27.950" style="s2">world Nexus as he he would call it or</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.279" end="00:39:32.329" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve kind of bound up our design</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.950" end="00:39:34.460" style="s2">or our being there in ourselves and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.329" end="00:39:37.579" style="s2">on the field of nihility it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.460" end="00:39:40.760" style="s2">this great equalizer where everything is</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.579" end="00:39:43.730" style="s2">like turned into a big question mark so</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.760" end="00:39:48.770" style="s2">to speak the the everything&#39;s being is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.730" end="00:39:51.230" style="s2">is is on this shaky ground of nihility</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.770" end="00:39:54.109" style="s2">so that&#39;s this like far side where</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.230" end="00:39:57.170" style="s2">everything has sort of been alienated in</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.109" end="00:39:59.779" style="s2">a sense and so what happens on the field</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.170" end="00:40:02.569" style="s2">of Shunyata and what would happen in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.779" end="00:40:05.809" style="s2">experience you described is is returning</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.569" end="00:40:09.109" style="s2">to the absolute near side like via the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.809" end="00:40:11.630" style="s2">far side we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone 360 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.109" end="00:40:14.809" style="s2">here around around the circle and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.630" end="00:40:19.670" style="s2">returned back to where we were but in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.809" end="00:40:23.029" style="s2">in a more expansive sense so well right</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.670" end="00:40:25.790" style="s2">you definitely see people who have an</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.029" end="00:40:29.000" style="s2">intuition of non-duality or some</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.790" end="00:40:31.100" style="s2">thing as being like very like</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.000" end="00:40:34.280" style="s2">transcendence focused and very like</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.100" end="00:40:36.590" style="s2">Gnostic or ascetic of like trying to to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.280" end="00:40:39.830" style="s2">deny particulars and leave the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.590" end="00:40:42.350" style="s2">behind and such and nishitani really</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.830" end="00:40:47.150" style="s2">really rejects that kind of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.350" end="00:40:51.050" style="s2">I&#39;m rightfully so I think because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.150" end="00:40:54.500" style="s2">gives no recourse for for like actually</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.670" end="00:41:07.430" style="s2">of this world Nexus as much as we are or</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.360" end="00:41:11.780" style="s2">the external world is as well so in in</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.780" end="00:41:18.920" style="s2">the way he he goes about this is he</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.680" end="00:41:23.180" style="s2">creates a non duality through particular</p>

<p begin="00:42:39.980" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">regurgitate that response that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.770" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">yeah Nishi tony would really see issue</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:51.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s as a perhaps as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">escape that naive escapism exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.660" end="00:42:57.810" style="s2">exactly when when you&#39;re when you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">that on that sort of path you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.810" end="00:43:03.480" style="s2">still in this field of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:06.060" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to to relate all other</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.480" end="00:43:09.810" style="s2">external things to this Tilos of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.060" end="00:43:13.740" style="s2">non-duality rather than meeting them as</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.810" end="00:43:17.460" style="s2">they are on their home ground okay so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.740" end="00:43:20.510" style="s2">and he still uses Juniata to describe</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.460" end="00:43:24.140" style="s2">that state which I also find interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.510" end="00:43:27.810" style="s2">just because again in my own experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.140" end="00:43:30.210" style="s2">it was kind of upon this realization of</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.810" end="00:43:32.010" style="s2">the motion through the non-dual back</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.210" end="00:43:34.950" style="s2">into the duel</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.010" end="00:43:38.340" style="s2">I might even describe it as a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.950" end="00:43:40.680" style="s2">of that that void that is the the ground</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.340" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">of being mixed with the fact of being</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.680" end="00:43:47.160" style="s2">itself that I saw kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:49.920" style="s2">re-emergence of the Godhead although he</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.160" end="00:43:54.260" style="s2">frames it in the Shunyata would it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.920" end="00:43:57.690" style="s2">perhaps be accurate to say that we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.260" end="00:44:00.860" style="s2">erroring in those depictions on either</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.690" end="00:44:00.860" style="s2">side of a paradox</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.740" end="00:44:09.930" style="s2">yeah I think so I I mean Juniata and its</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.760" end="00:44:14.859" style="s2">standpoint is is inherently a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.930" end="00:44:18.220" style="s2">paradoxical place to be where the</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.859" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">opposites are always mutually dependent</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.220" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">and and mutually self arising another</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.430" style="s2">important point in in terms of some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:30.520" style="s2">the language you just brought up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.430" end="00:44:33.330" style="s2">Godhead is that nishitani draws pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.520" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">extensively on meister eckhart and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.330" end="00:44:37.750" style="s2">employs the term god had a explicitly a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.700" end="00:44:41.820" style="s2">number of times</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.750" end="00:44:44.020" style="s2">Oh interesting yeah he sees Eckhart&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.820" end="00:44:50.099" style="s2">utilization of this term and how he</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.020" end="00:44:53.020" style="s2">explores it as probably the closest that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.099" end="00:44:55.810" style="s2">Western Christian thinking has has</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.020" end="00:44:58.920" style="s2">gotten to the standpoint of of emptiness</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.810" end="00:45:01.960" style="s2">in terms of its various theological</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:05.349" style="s2">manifestations so right yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.960" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">Eckhart even talks I think pretty</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.349" end="00:45:11.109" style="s2">explicitly in some of the quotations and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:13.390" style="s2">yutani employees about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.109" end="00:45:16.540" style="s2">nothingness of the Godhead or or how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.390" end="00:45:19.480" style="s2">become nothing in the Godhead and right</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.540" end="00:45:24.099" style="s2">like the self realizes the Godhead and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.480" end="00:45:25.750" style="s2">in these various ways that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.099" end="00:45:27.609" style="s2">because I&#39;ve often kind of tried to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.750" end="00:45:30.550" style="s2">create or I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m creating</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.609" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">describe a convergent point between</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.550" end="00:45:37.180" style="s2">Buddhism and Christianity in that in</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:40.420" style="s2">some sense the goal of emptying the self</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.180" end="00:45:43.980" style="s2">is is required within the West</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.420" end="00:45:47.530" style="s2">well the Christian tradition such that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.980" end="00:45:49.720" style="s2">right yeah you have to empty it all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.530" end="00:45:52.060" style="s2">way in order for it to be filled and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.720" end="00:45:55.660" style="s2">perhaps the paradox is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.060" end="00:45:58.990" style="s2">filling right right right yeah no that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.660" end="00:46:01.300" style="s2">that speaks really profoundly to to some</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.990" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">of what Nietzsche Tawny&#39;s outlining here</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.300" end="00:46:07.960" style="s2">and I mean he&#39;s right there with you in</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:10.330" style="s2">terms of analyzing Western religion</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.960" end="00:46:13.529" style="s2">along those lines as well he he goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.330" end="00:46:17.410" style="s2">back to the Greek term connotes</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.529" end="00:46:21.670" style="s2">to describe the emptying of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.410" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">self-will of Jesus specifically like on</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.670" end="00:46:29.799" style="s2">like through his life and devotion to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:32.229" style="s2">God and how in the emptying it does have</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.799" end="00:46:34.900" style="s2">this fullness that comes out I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.229" end="00:46:38.999" style="s2">was via the emptying of this self will</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.900" end="00:46:42.239" style="s2">of Christ that his he was able to embody</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.999" end="00:46:45.749" style="s2">divinity fully right right in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.239" end="00:46:49.719" style="s2">Western consciousness so yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.749" end="00:46:53.249" style="s2">connects that as well to as like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.719" end="00:46:56.190" style="s2">ground for the idea of agape as this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.249" end="00:47:01.569" style="s2">non-discriminating non differentiating</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.190" end="00:47:04.930" style="s2">lovingness outpouring is also really</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.569" end="00:47:09.369" style="s2">grounded in this this idea of self</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.930" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">emptying interesting very cool thank you</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.369" end="00:47:14.559" style="s2">very much that clarified a lot of points</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:16.209" style="s2">that I was great thanks for thanks for</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.559" end="00:47:18.430" style="s2">sharing your experience super</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.209" end="00:47:21.130" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.430" end="00:47:25.900" style="s2">Hey any other questions and yeah when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.130" end="00:47:28.150" style="s2">get my dope on that a little bit I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.900" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">got a quote here just to contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.150" end="00:47:33.099" style="s2">it this is an entry on differential</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:37.299" style="s2">ontology and that stands in contrast to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.099" end="00:47:40.450" style="s2">essentialism which so essentialism</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.299" end="00:47:45.400" style="s2">substantial ism I do you know how they</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.450" end="00:47:49.329" style="s2">they linked it here essentialism and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:51.039" style="s2">substantial ism in in nishitani no no in</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.329" end="00:47:52.569" style="s2">Western history so I mean like Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.039" end="00:47:54.220" style="s2">he didn&#39;t really make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.569" end="00:47:55.990" style="s2">between substance and essence they were</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.220" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">pretty much synonymous as for engagement</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.990" end="00:48:02.619" style="s2">right okay so I just wanted to get that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:04.720" style="s2">so this is a quotes about yield to lose</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.619" end="00:48:06.609" style="s2">as a differential intelligence and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.720" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">will connected in a second okay so as</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.609" end="00:48:12.099" style="s2">early as 1954 they lose stress the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:14.410" style="s2">urgency for an ontology of pure</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.099" end="00:48:17.619" style="s2">difference one that does not rely upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.410" end="00:48:19.480" style="s2">the notion of negation because negation</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.619" end="00:48:22.059" style="s2">is merely different pushed to its</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.480" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">uttermost limit and on how did your pure</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.059" end="00:48:27.039" style="s2">difference means an attempt to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:29.829" style="s2">difference as pure relation rather than</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.039" end="00:48:31.180" style="s2">as not you know I was wondering well</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.829" end="00:48:33.579" style="s2">attaches and some of the stuff that Nick</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.180" end="00:48:37.380" style="s2">said but I was also wondering do you</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.579" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">connect that up with indras net at all</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:41.799" style="s2">mm-hmm-hmm great question</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.490" end="00:48:43.569" style="s2">I got a run for a bathroom break real</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.799" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">quick but I&#39;ll come back to your</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.569" end="00:48:47.740" style="s2">question in just a moment here what</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.539" style="s2">you&#39;re Jared tonight so we&#39;re coming up</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.740" end="00:48:51.039" style="s2">to an hour I want to be respectful of</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.539" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">your time are you are you okay to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.039" end="00:48:59.410" style="s2">continue or what is is free for today so</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:49:03.190" style="s2">I&#39;m happy to continue on here for quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.410" end="00:49:06.869" style="s2">some time so oh great all right oh great</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.190" end="00:49:06.869" style="s2">take a take a break</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:14.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s also been a good discussion</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.690" end="00:49:16.559" style="s2">yeah go ahead and Brett did you by any</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.039" end="00:49:18.539" style="s2">chance manage to figure out how we might</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.559" end="00:49:21.539" style="s2">go about recording on here I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.539" end="00:49:24.890" style="s2">looked into that I did not but Tyler did</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.539" end="00:49:28.440" style="s2">so we&#39;re giving it a shot and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.890" end="00:49:31.309" style="s2">hopefully you know it&#39;ll work and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.440" end="00:49:34.230" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure out the best way to host it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.309" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">glad to hear it yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.230" end="00:49:37.740" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s good yeah yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:42.539" style="s2">that&#39;s a good feature we should try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.740" end="00:49:44.569" style="s2">record all these discussions and and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.539" end="00:49:49.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we post them to YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.569" end="00:49:50.279" style="s2">or just load them up on I don&#39;t know one</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.170" end="00:49:52.279" style="s2">of the file-sharing sites probably</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.279" end="00:49:57.539" style="s2">YouTube&#39;s probably a good way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.279" end="00:49:59.309" style="s2">yeah and and and everybody can record</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.539" end="00:50:01.829" style="s2">their do their own recording too just to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.309" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">be to be clear you know you know there</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.829" end="00:50:05.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be the official</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:09.380" style="s2">recording in the recording permitted</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.400" end="00:50:09.380" style="s2">channels anyone can record go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:21.569" style="s2">very cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.760" end="00:50:30.410" style="s2">like wait no Jared but maybe still afk</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.930" end="00:50:33.220" style="s2">he just stepped away for for a short</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.410" end="00:50:33.220" style="s2">second but he&#39;s coming back</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:37.279" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.660" end="00:50:43.700" style="s2">but it yeah it&#39;s been a good discussion</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.279" end="00:50:46.549" style="s2">and and yeah and don&#39;t be shy about guys</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.700" end="00:50:48.740" style="s2">about you know about asking questions</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.549" end="00:50:51.109" style="s2">and you know any any and all questions</p>

<p begin="00:51:07.730" end="00:51:12.849" style="s2">know all questions are welcome</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.840" end="00:51:14.540" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.820" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that they said that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.380" end="00:51:58.500" style="s2">nishitani doesn&#39;t focus on the practical</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.450" end="00:52:00.609" style="s2">and and I find you know that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.500" end="00:52:01.990" style="s2">can be an issue where we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.609" end="00:52:04.420" style="s2">these philosophical discussions which</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.990" end="00:52:08.130" style="s2">stay a very sort of high level and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.420" end="00:52:10.869" style="s2">even sometimes poetic and very just very</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.130" end="00:52:13.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t like to use what fuzzy but</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.869" end="00:52:15.700" style="s2">almost fuzzy concepts that when we say</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.390" end="00:52:18.810" style="s2">okay but how do we apply this in real</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.700" end="00:52:21.310" style="s2">life become yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.810" end="00:52:23.230" style="s2">sometimes aren&#39;t quite as crystallizable</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.310" end="00:52:25.480" style="s2">and that that&#39;s something I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.230" end="00:52:27.310" style="s2">especially here we should be focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.480" end="00:52:28.660" style="s2">I mean in terms of if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.310" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">about the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.660" end="00:52:35.770" style="s2">if we can&#39;t translate these things into</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:37.000" style="s2">practical lived experience then then</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.770" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna be in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.000" end="00:52:43.710" style="s2">that there&#39;s got to be some some part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.400" end="00:52:43.710" style="s2">our focus I think Jared Jarrett&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.940" end="00:52:49.580" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.650" end="00:52:52.849" style="s2">you</p>

<p begin="00:52:52.849" end="00:53:01.549" style="s2">hello all right could you read that to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.999" end="00:53:04.059" style="s2">lose our quote about to lose again just</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.549" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">so I&#39;m on the right track with that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.059" end="00:53:10.299" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.640" end="00:53:12.430" style="s2">as early as 1954 Daluz stressed the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.299" end="00:53:14.410" style="s2">urgency for an ontology of pure</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.430" end="00:53:17.049" style="s2">difference one that does not rely upon</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.410" end="00:53:18.880" style="s2">the notion of negation because negation</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.049" end="00:53:20.769" style="s2">is merely difference pushed to its</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.880" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">outermost limit so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.769" end="00:53:25.450" style="s2">connection between well negation and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:27.010" style="s2">nihilism life right on an ontology of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.450" end="00:53:29.829" style="s2">pure difference means an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.010" end="00:53:31.930" style="s2">think difference as pure relation rather</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.829" end="00:53:34.180" style="s2">than is not and that&#39;s the connection in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.930" end="00:53:37.089" style="s2">that I would draw two in designate yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.180" end="00:53:39.099" style="s2">yeah and if you could justify not could</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.089" end="00:53:41.950" style="s2">you define ontology for everyone too</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.099" end="00:53:45.369" style="s2">while you&#39;re that&#39;s basically the study</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.950" end="00:53:48.010" style="s2">of being aware the original Greek word</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.369" end="00:53:50.279" style="s2">was on toss for thing so the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.010" end="00:53:53.230" style="s2">would be here between being and nothing</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.279" end="00:53:56.079" style="s2">mm-hmm so the ontology but nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.230" end="00:53:59.529" style="s2">says that both being and ahilla t are</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.079" end="00:54:01.269" style="s2">real so it gets a bit dicey because the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.529" end="00:54:03.460" style="s2">the generally the oncologist to it would</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.269" end="00:54:05.230" style="s2">use the the more Western notion of real</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.460" end="00:54:09.069" style="s2">which initial time he doesn&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.230" end="00:54:12.009" style="s2">right yeah I think that works really</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.069" end="00:54:15.819" style="s2">well with with nishitani z&#39; framework</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.009" end="00:54:18.339" style="s2">here definitely the idea of negation as</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.819" end="00:54:20.710" style="s2">a sort of a parallel to Tannehill OT</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.339" end="00:54:23.950" style="s2">here that it it sort of chopped things</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.710" end="00:54:26.049" style="s2">off like fully in a way that is not what</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.950" end="00:54:29.619" style="s2">we were looking for as a final</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.049" end="00:54:33.869" style="s2">standpoint and then also yeah the idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.619" end="00:54:38.049" style="s2">of a relational ontology is is is</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.869" end="00:54:40.569" style="s2">definitely huge in that I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.049" end="00:54:44.700" style="s2">nishitani might mention indras net once</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.569" end="00:54:47.890" style="s2">or twice explicitly but he certainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.700" end="00:54:50.769" style="s2">describes something very similar to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.890" end="00:54:55.170" style="s2">multiple times especially when he talks</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.769" end="00:54:59.710" style="s2">about the slave and master dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.170" end="00:55:02.680" style="s2">between all things so let&#39;s say your</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.710" end="00:55:05.740" style="s2">radio is the master of all things in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.680" end="00:55:08.440" style="s2">universe but at the same time your radio</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.740" end="00:55:10.329" style="s2">is also slave to all other things so</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.440" end="00:55:14.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this deeply interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.329" end="00:55:19.740" style="s2">thing where the being of one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.170" end="00:55:22.260" style="s2">always very interdependent on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.740" end="00:55:25.380" style="s2">and of all other things and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.260" end="00:55:30.690" style="s2">nothingness and emptiness that that that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.380" end="00:55:32.190" style="s2">dynamic is able to arise out of well the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.690" end="00:55:34.530" style="s2">way that I&#39;m looking at it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.190" end="00:55:36.780" style="s2">see it seems to me like indras net is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.530" end="00:55:39.660" style="s2">expression of relativity taken to its</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.780" end="00:55:42.690" style="s2">apotheosis known is an expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.660" end="00:55:44.760" style="s2">relation as such rather than emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.690" end="00:55:46.320" style="s2">the absolute where yeah the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.760" end="00:55:48.869" style="s2">would be like the self contained thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.320" end="00:55:51.360" style="s2">the thing that is the thing in itself so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.869" end="00:55:54.270" style="s2">that that&#39;s just like a I guess what I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.360" end="00:56:00.330" style="s2">was trying to get at is is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.270" end="00:56:03.450" style="s2">Mahela T or Shunyata like relativity in</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.330" end="00:56:06.510" style="s2">that sense not not without necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.450" end="00:56:10.369" style="s2">the pejorative notion that waste that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.510" end="00:56:10.369" style="s2">the waste has towards relativism as such</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.220" end="00:56:14.220" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.309" end="00:56:27.529" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I&#39;d say things</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.599" end="00:56:29.390" style="s2">things definitely aren&#39;t relativized in</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.529" end="00:56:34.299" style="s2">in what you were saying is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.390" end="00:56:40.670" style="s2">pejorative notion but I things are also</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.299" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">not purely relational in in like the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.670" end="00:56:48.259" style="s2">sense that you can only ever define the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:51.019" style="s2">the essence of a of a thing in its in</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.259" end="00:56:55.989" style="s2">its relationships initially definitely</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.019" end="00:56:59.569" style="s2">sees the dependence there and and how</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.989" end="00:57:02.710" style="s2">the thing in itself on its own home</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.569" end="00:57:05.829" style="s2">ground is is a relationally</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.710" end="00:57:10.569" style="s2">interconnected thing in this world Nexus</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.829" end="00:57:14.809" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think he does away with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.569" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">sense of in true individuality of of</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.809" end="00:57:24.319" style="s2">things as well I don&#39;t think he is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:28.130" style="s2">involved in what Hartmann and the triple</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.319" end="00:57:32.440" style="s2">o people call over mining where you will</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.130" end="00:57:35.539" style="s2">reduce a thing to its its relationality</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.440" end="00:57:39.289" style="s2">one of the important Japanese terms that</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.539" end="00:57:42.589" style="s2">nishitani employed is koto which means</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.289" end="00:57:48.200" style="s2">like the meaning of a thing or the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.589" end="00:57:51.970" style="s2">essence of a thing and it it really does</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.200" end="00:57:57.380" style="s2">impart this sense of genuine</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.980" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the emptiness aspect of the fire</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.680" end="01:00:03.980" style="s2">is is identified with this idea of koto</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:06.230" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s not the the fire Ness of</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.980" end="01:00:11.470" style="s2">the fire but it&#39;s the non fairness of</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.230" end="01:00:14.870" style="s2">the fire that that imbues it with this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.470" end="01:00:17.300" style="s2">individuality in a sense so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.870" end="01:00:21.800" style="s2">that&#39;s where it departs from from this</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.300" end="01:00:24.350" style="s2">thinking of substance okay so if i</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.800" end="01:00:26.870" style="s2">understand correctly the fire the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.350" end="01:00:28.190" style="s2">part of the fire that doesn&#39;t burn is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.870" end="01:00:32.010" style="s2">some sense unobservable</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.190" end="01:00:36.010" style="s2">but it&#39;s there is that right</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.010" end="01:00:41.230" style="s2">definitely yeah unobservable in in its</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.010" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">own sense but I mean we also do see a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.230" end="01:00:47.260" style="s2">fire burning and not burning itself</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:51.700" style="s2">similar to how if we poured water into</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.260" end="01:00:56.500" style="s2">water we wouldn&#39;t see the though or we</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.700" end="01:01:00.460" style="s2">would wait we wouldn&#39;t see the water get</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.500" end="01:01:03.600" style="s2">wet oh I can&#39;t see space but I can</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.460" end="01:01:04.780" style="s2">obviously see space you know right</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.600" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.780" end="01:01:13.210" style="s2">perhaps the most direct and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:18.070" style="s2">apprehensible version of this is the eye</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.210" end="01:01:21.370" style="s2">which sees but does not see itself being</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.070" end="01:01:25.060" style="s2">being the nature of sight vision and our</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.370" end="01:01:28.750" style="s2">eyes so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.060" end="01:01:34.170" style="s2">complicated dynamic nishitani would say</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.750" end="01:01:38.620" style="s2">that you don&#39;t really hit at the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.170" end="01:01:44.680" style="s2">non-burning of fire if you&#39;re staying on</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.620" end="01:01:46.950" style="s2">this this field of coquito and looking</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.680" end="01:01:51.310" style="s2">at things only through this being</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.950" end="01:01:54.100" style="s2">substance sense but that on the field of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.310" end="01:01:57.820" style="s2">Juniata this this aspect of things would</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.100" end="01:02:01.600" style="s2">would would become clear in your</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.820" end="01:02:04.980" style="s2">existential approach and also in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.600" end="01:02:07.140" style="s2">like ontological reality</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.980" end="01:02:10.099" style="s2">okay thanks add-ons another question</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.140" end="01:02:10.099" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.810" end="01:02:18.090" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.730" end="01:02:20.330" style="s2">anyone else here with something together</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.090" end="01:02:23.640" style="s2">but another one I just don&#39;t a jumpin</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.330" end="01:02:26.280" style="s2">Tyler question while you were away as</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.640" end="01:02:29.160" style="s2">well that may be an interesting one if</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.280" end="01:02:33.420" style="s2">he&#39;s still around to ask it hmm yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.160" end="01:02:34.109" style="s2">would definitely take that he may he may</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.420" end="01:02:36.450" style="s2">have stepped away</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.109" end="01:02:39.750" style="s2">Karima you had you had a question right</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.450" end="01:02:42.450" style="s2">yeah I do I just you know wanted to let</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.750" end="01:02:46.590" style="s2">other people that haven&#39;t spoken have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.450" end="01:02:50.359" style="s2">chance but I&#39;m wondering you know how</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.590" end="01:02:52.920" style="s2">things happened very synchronistically</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.359" end="01:02:55.710" style="s2">sometimes we notice sometimes we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.920" end="01:02:59.670" style="s2">sometimes later we notice anyways about</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.710" end="01:03:05.760" style="s2">20 minutes before I got on this call I</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.670" end="01:03:08.369" style="s2">had texted someone and you know together</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.760" end="01:03:12.090" style="s2">when we used the G word we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.369" end="01:03:15.630" style="s2">talking about the equally you know 500</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.090" end="01:03:18.570" style="s2">other names you can use for that but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.630" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">said I&#39;ve been thinking about how to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.570" end="01:03:25.530" style="s2">know I am doing God&#39;s will which is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:28.500" style="s2">sacred adventure I do realize the will</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.530" end="01:03:31.740" style="s2">of God penetrating all substance and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.500" end="01:03:33.930" style="s2">nature and that it can at least be</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.740" end="01:03:41.070" style="s2">reduced to the common denominator of</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.930" end="01:03:44.100" style="s2">love life and light and then I said do I</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.070" end="01:03:47.640" style="s2">dare to think this very moment is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.100" end="01:03:50.490" style="s2">will of God coming alive in me minute by</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.640" end="01:03:54.650" style="s2">minute when I simply do the next step</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.490" end="01:03:59.640" style="s2">before me with integrity and love and</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.650" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">when you two are talking about how this</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.640" end="01:04:07.770" style="s2">adventure of being human we discover the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:11.820" style="s2">the eminent of that which is all and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.770" end="01:04:14.640" style="s2">transcendence into that which is all you</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.820" end="01:04:16.890" style="s2">know the idea is we still continue to</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.640" end="01:04:19.619" style="s2">wash dishes and help our neighbors they</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.890" end="01:04:22.200" style="s2">need groceries so how do we merge the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.619" end="01:04:26.609" style="s2">absolute and the relative is this whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.200" end="01:04:27.810" style="s2">game but does nishitani speak of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.609" end="01:04:30.570" style="s2">will like who</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.810" end="01:04:34.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll is it you know we can we can kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.570" end="01:04:36.120" style="s2">of tell by the effects in our life you</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.560" end="01:04:39.630" style="s2">know what if we pay attention to our</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.120" end="01:04:43.560" style="s2">intentions and our actions so we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.630" end="01:04:46.050" style="s2">relate to it&#39;s maybe a different or</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.560" end="01:04:51.750" style="s2">better or you know a nicely infused</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.050" end="01:04:55.440" style="s2">aspect of will but does he speak of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.750" end="01:04:58.290" style="s2">at all in his writing yeah he tackles</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.440" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">will a lot especially in the last</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.290" end="01:05:05.550" style="s2">chapter of Juniata and history when he</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:07.440" style="s2">analyzes how so many different theories</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.550" end="01:05:09.660" style="s2">of history or standpoints towards</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.440" end="01:05:11.820" style="s2">history have have been based in this</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.660" end="01:05:15.240" style="s2">idea of will whether it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.820" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">traditional theistic conception of God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.240" end="01:05:24.890" style="s2">will being the driver of history or our</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:28.170" style="s2">more enlightenment ideal of progress</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.890" end="01:05:30.080" style="s2">stemming from human will as being the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.170" end="01:05:32.370" style="s2">driver of history and then to</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.080" end="01:05:36.630" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s idea of the will to power</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.370" end="01:05:39.030" style="s2">and and his eternal recurrence which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.630" end="01:05:42.770" style="s2">his theory of history that sort of based</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.030" end="01:05:47.610" style="s2">on this idea nishitani really wants to</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.770" end="01:05:50.760" style="s2">get past the idea of will altogether in</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.610" end="01:05:54.030" style="s2">in a lot of ways because he ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.760" end="01:05:57.740" style="s2">sees this as something intimately bound</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.030" end="01:06:01.730" style="s2">up in this idea of of selfhood and</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.740" end="01:06:04.740" style="s2">self-consciousness in in a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.730" end="01:06:07.860" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t really mesh well with this</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.740" end="01:06:14.040" style="s2">broader vision of this integrated world</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.860" end="01:06:17.810" style="s2">nexus so yeah go ahead you mentioned in</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.040" end="01:06:21.870" style="s2">the end of your talk an auto t illogical</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.810" end="01:06:23.910" style="s2">photographic an ontological history that</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.870" end="01:06:28.130" style="s2">was it and then john said what is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.910" end="01:06:33.440" style="s2">giver of paradigms what gives the being</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.130" end="01:06:35.330" style="s2">that is not a B so you know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.440" end="01:06:37.340" style="s2">how to get around you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.330" end="01:06:40.840" style="s2">sometimes I think about this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.340" end="01:06:46.520" style="s2">well apparently I have been lately but</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.840" end="01:06:48.830" style="s2">yeah you had said a you know going from</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.520" end="01:06:54.560" style="s2">going into a more multi-dimensional view</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.830" end="01:06:56.660" style="s2">of history and you know I mean how do</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.560" end="01:06:59.240" style="s2">you explain who&#39;s driving the bus you</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.660" end="01:07:00.530" style="s2">know it&#39;s probably everything I always</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.240" end="01:07:02.600" style="s2">figured everything you can think of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.530" end="01:07:05.420" style="s2">probably is happening in some way so</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.600" end="01:07:08.030" style="s2">we&#39;re all co-creating this existence and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.420" end="01:07:10.430" style="s2">yet you know there&#39;s other forces powers</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.030" end="01:07:12.320" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to say what or define it</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.430" end="01:07:13.790" style="s2">but you know something goes on I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.320" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">when the moon&#39;s full we feel something</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.790" end="01:07:23.930" style="s2">so you know but yeah you were mentioning</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:25.010" style="s2">that a non geological history and I was</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.930" end="01:07:27.670" style="s2">just wondering that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.010" end="01:07:32.510" style="s2">you&#39;re saying he hoped we go toward</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.670" end="01:07:37.340" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah it&#39;s what he both views as</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.510" end="01:07:41.510" style="s2">the actual situation and what he thinks</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.340" end="01:07:46.310" style="s2">we should take as a healthier more</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.510" end="01:07:50.780" style="s2">proper theory of history so yeah and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.310" end="01:07:54.440" style="s2">terms of the will bound up in the self</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.780" end="01:07:57.740" style="s2">definitely but of course there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.440" end="01:08:00.920" style="s2">going to be action and happening and</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.740" end="01:08:04.810" style="s2">doing even on this this field of Juniata</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.920" end="01:08:10.990" style="s2">similar to how he doesn&#39;t want to deny</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.810" end="01:08:13.970" style="s2">particularity and wants to actually see</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.990" end="01:08:16.490" style="s2">non duality being dependent on</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.970" end="01:08:20.420" style="s2">particularity and vice-versa</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.490" end="01:08:23.150" style="s2">he he does still have an idea of action</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.420" end="01:08:26.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s of course going to be an</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.150" end="01:08:29.960" style="s2">action of non action and so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.600" end="01:08:35.060" style="s2">have a teleology of non teleology as</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.960" end="01:08:36.170" style="s2">well so I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.060" end="01:08:39.610" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.170" end="01:08:41.690" style="s2">I like the butterfly effect you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.610" end="01:08:43.339" style="s2">butterfly on this branch</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.690" end="01:08:44.779" style="s2">you&#39;re wiggling his wings definitely</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.339" end="01:08:47.509" style="s2">effects something on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.779" end="01:08:49.549" style="s2">the world you know I think that and</p>

<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:08:59.449" style="s2">words like non-duality and like what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.920" end="01:09:02.569" style="s2">that and is it the opposite of duality</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.449" end="01:09:05.270" style="s2">and it&#39;s also confusing but I just think</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.770" end="01:12:49.500" style="s2">for me personally one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.700" end="01:12:53.550" style="s2">impactful features of nishitani x&#39; work</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.500" end="01:12:57.800" style="s2">here has is the the the nature of his</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.550" end="01:13:02.010" style="s2">method and the vision of his project I</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.800" end="01:13:05.910" style="s2">mean he&#39;s he&#39;s drawing from traditional</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.010" end="01:13:08.520" style="s2">Mahayana Buddhist sources he&#39;s widely</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.910" end="01:13:12.420" style="s2">familiar with Western philosophy and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.520" end="01:13:16.520" style="s2">shows as much as he talks about each of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.420" end="01:13:19.680" style="s2">these figures but he&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.520" end="01:13:21.960" style="s2">invested in the development of</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.680" end="01:13:26.250" style="s2">Christianity and that religious system</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.960" end="01:13:30.710" style="s2">and the way he approaches things isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.250" end="01:13:33.660" style="s2">simply as a Zen philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.710" end="01:13:35.970" style="s2">pretty-pretty right off the bat in in</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.660" end="01:13:39.780" style="s2">his text here he makes it clear that</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.970" end="01:13:45.840" style="s2">he&#39;s not using this term Shunyata out of</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.780" end="01:13:48.240" style="s2">any sort of exoteric loyalty to to</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.840" end="01:13:52.350" style="s2">buddhism as a tradition but simply</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.240" end="01:13:55.910" style="s2">because it is a manifestation of a deep</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.350" end="01:13:59.340" style="s2">truth and so I mean there&#39;s times</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.910" end="01:14:04.680" style="s2">throughout his text here where he cites</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.340" end="01:14:09.210" style="s2">the Gospels not as just a source to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.680" end="01:14:12.150" style="s2">analyzed but as an exposition of truth</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.210" end="01:14:15.690" style="s2">in the same way that he is employing</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.150" end="01:14:21.180" style="s2">this idea of Shunyata and so being able</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.690" end="01:14:25.949" style="s2">to draw from from these wide sources and</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.180" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">be deeply discriminating in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.949" end="01:14:33.570" style="s2">finding truth and in all these nooks and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:35.370" style="s2">crannies of human philosophical and</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.570" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2">theological thinking throughout history</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.370" end="01:14:44.580" style="s2">is is very refreshing compared to many</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.000" end="01:14:48.000" style="s2">philosophical and theological projects</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.580" end="01:14:50.570" style="s2">that are much narrower in terms of sort</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.000" end="01:14:53.780" style="s2">of being grounded in in certain credo</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.570" end="01:14:59.420" style="s2">presuppositions of what the bounds of a</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.780" end="01:15:02.160" style="s2">truth seeking project could be so just</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.420" end="01:15:08.219" style="s2">and out of that like comes this this</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.160" end="01:15:15.570" style="s2">vision of religious truth being much</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.219" end="01:15:18.870" style="s2">more accessible and pervasive than then</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.570" end="01:15:21.690" style="s2">we would often think in terms of the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.870" end="01:15:23.730" style="s2">the religious truth being a something</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.690" end="01:15:28.110" style="s2">that&#39;s just merely given by an</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.730" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">institution or something of the like so</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.110" end="01:15:37.260" style="s2">yeah I find a lot of inspiration in in</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:39.989" style="s2">the nature of that project and I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.260" end="01:15:41.850" style="s2">certainly connects very readily to this</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.989" end="01:15:45.600" style="s2">idea of the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.850" end="01:15:49.620" style="s2">religion of being able to to draw deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.600" end="01:15:54.690" style="s2">from these various sources for religious</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.620" end="01:16:00.000" style="s2">ends and philosophical ends but not not</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.690" end="01:16:02.910" style="s2">be bound by certain orthodoxies or or</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.000" end="01:16:06.960" style="s2">creedal presuppositions but on the on</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.910" end="01:16:10.880" style="s2">the flip side and also not be engaged in</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.960" end="01:16:15.630" style="s2">a you know merely cherry-picking or</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.880" end="01:16:18.120" style="s2">idealizing project of just throwing a</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.630" end="01:16:23.640" style="s2">bunch of things together that that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.120" end="01:16:26.460" style="s2">like and trying to to build self suited</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.640" end="01:16:29.360" style="s2">philosophy out of those I think anyone</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.460" end="01:16:33.150" style="s2">who reads Nietzsche Tony&#39;s book will</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.360" end="01:16:35.760" style="s2">probably not see that as his project</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.150" end="01:16:39.630" style="s2">here even though he is drawing from from</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.760" end="01:16:44.850" style="s2">multiple traditions and sources here so</p>

<p begin="01:25:51.910" end="01:25:59.170" style="s2">mean then when you remove the the self</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.290" end="01:26:01.719" style="s2">from this dynamic of ahilla tea there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:26:18.520" end="01:26:22.930" style="s2">there&#39;s still things even when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:26:36.910" end="01:26:42.040" style="s2">I wonder if I could ask a question that</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.740" end="01:26:44.080" style="s2">pulls off from what you just said so</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.040" end="01:26:46.360" style="s2">thinking of the nothing the no thickness</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.080" end="01:26:48.250" style="s2">of the self I mean I think of it as the</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.360" end="01:26:52.120" style="s2">South being a process right that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.250" end="01:26:54.100" style="s2">know a process of the brain but it and</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.120" end="01:26:55.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a thing in that sense but it</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.100" end="01:26:58.630" style="s2">but in a very real sense at least when</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.750" end="01:27:00.640" style="s2">we come to physical things everything is</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.630" end="01:27:03.610" style="s2">a process you know they&#39;re all made up</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.640" end="01:27:05.350" style="s2">of moving particles in relation to one</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.610" end="01:27:08.200" style="s2">another and I guess the difference</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.350" end="01:27:10.300" style="s2">between like a process like like</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.200" end="01:27:12.310" style="s2">thinking or a process like you know with</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.300" end="01:27:15.760" style="s2">the machine is that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.310" end="01:27:18.640" style="s2">relationship between the particles you</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.760" end="01:27:20.950" style="s2">know it&#39;s not an you know the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.640" end="01:27:24.210" style="s2">varies whereas in a thing the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.950" end="01:27:26.820" style="s2">stays more constant but</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.210" end="01:27:28.560" style="s2">I it just seems that there shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.820" end="01:27:31.260" style="s2">like should we really be that</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.560" end="01:27:34.040" style="s2">uncomfortable with the self being a</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.260" end="01:27:37.260" style="s2">process if everything is a process</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.040" end="01:27:38.910" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah yeah I mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.260" end="01:27:42.000" style="s2">a good point</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.910" end="01:27:44.670" style="s2">nishitani doesn&#39;t directly talk about</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.000" end="01:27:45.690" style="s2">the self as a process in quite the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.670" end="01:27:48.510" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.690" end="01:27:54.450" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely consonant to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.510" end="01:27:58.100" style="s2">with his thinking I&#39;d say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.450" end="01:28:02.130" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s still a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.100" end="01:28:05.719" style="s2">things can&#39;t be reduced to to process he</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.130" end="01:28:10.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want time to sort of swallow up</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.719" end="01:28:14.400" style="s2">things in a so to speak but yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.950" end="01:28:15.270" style="s2">in the introduction to religion and</p>

<p begin="01:29:32.560" end="01:29:38.660" style="s2">perennialism that kind of arose in</p>

<p begin="01:29:53.930" end="01:29:59.540" style="s2">be a accurate description of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.449" end="01:30:02.780" style="s2">hoping to find there and in what way do</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.540" end="01:30:05.570" style="s2">you think nishitani offers a pathway to</p>

<p begin="01:30:05.570" end="01:30:14.330" style="s2">earlier forms yeah great question</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.590" end="01:30:16.730" style="s2">absolutely I actually have a have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.330" end="01:30:20.690" style="s2">strong background in perennialism it was</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.730" end="01:30:25.070" style="s2">my thesis topic in undergrad so I I do</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.690" end="01:30:28.730" style="s2">have some some robust experience here</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.070" end="01:30:31.250" style="s2">that I can bring to bear on this so what</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.730" end="01:30:34.670" style="s2">is called perennialism or often also</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.250" end="01:30:37.910" style="s2">called traditionalism is a modern</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.670" end="01:30:41.030" style="s2">religious philosophical movement mmm</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.910" end="01:30:45.320" style="s2">often considered to be started by Rene</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.030" end="01:30:48.070" style="s2">gay known a French thinker who was</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.320" end="01:30:51.020" style="s2">initially interested in in the occult</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.070" end="01:30:55.730" style="s2">but then moved more in the direction of</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.020" end="01:30:58.640" style="s2">traditional religion he eventually came</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.730" end="01:31:02.230" style="s2">to convert to Islam and moved to Cairo</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.640" end="01:31:05.900" style="s2">where he lived out the rest of his life</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.230" end="01:31:09.530" style="s2">he influenced a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.900" end="01:31:13.130" style="s2">other thinkers the most important being</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.530" end="01:31:16.659" style="s2">Fritjof xuan who was also a prolific</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.130" end="01:31:22.429" style="s2">writer and the two of them are probably</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.659" end="01:31:25.159" style="s2">considered the most influential and</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.429" end="01:31:28.250" style="s2">prolific of the perennial estores and</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.159" end="01:31:29.230" style="s2">both of them ended up converting to</p>

<p begin="01:31:38.030" end="01:31:43.340" style="s2">people associate perennialism with</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.340" end="01:31:46.640" style="s2">Aldous Huxley but it was a it was a</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.340" end="01:31:49.670" style="s2">movement that started long before Huxley</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.640" end="01:31:52.880" style="s2">wrote about it and this this core</p>

<p begin="01:31:52.880" end="01:31:59.750" style="s2">Xuan here is actually pretty critical of</p>

<p begin="01:32:03.199" end="01:32:11.500" style="s2">think that he misses some some important</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.659" end="01:32:14.900" style="s2">points so in terms of how nishitani</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.500" end="01:32:16.900" style="s2">compares to to these this particular</p>

<p begin="01:32:16.900" end="01:32:24.969" style="s2">definitely differs in in some important</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.600" end="01:32:28.570" style="s2">ways he is more of a philosopher and an</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.969" end="01:32:34.790" style="s2">existentialist the traditionalists are</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.570" end="01:32:40.550" style="s2">pretty interested in upholding orthodoxy</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.790" end="01:32:42.679" style="s2">and the institutions of Orthodoxy within</p>

<p begin="01:32:42.679" end="01:32:48.199" style="s2">much more focused in on the esoteric</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.650" end="01:32:55.040" style="s2">side of religion than the high standards</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.199" end="01:33:00.140" style="s2">but they they definitely see immediate</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.040" end="01:33:06.070" style="s2">necessary value in the exoteric and so</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.140" end="01:33:11.179" style="s2">in terms of sort of coming up with very</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.070" end="01:33:14.330" style="s2">novel interpretations of doctrine they</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.179" end="01:33:16.159" style="s2">at least profess to be against such</p>

<p begin="01:34:10.459" end="01:34:20.389" style="s2">so when nishitani is bringing in he</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.399" end="01:34:24.050" style="s2">almost wants to boo dyes Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.389" end="01:34:27.619" style="s2">and and bring some of these ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.050" end="01:34:29.269" style="s2">emptiness into the Christian system that</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.619" end="01:34:34.489" style="s2">would be something that the perennial</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.269" end="01:34:37.519" style="s2">aswer likely opposed they would respond</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.489" end="01:34:39.739" style="s2">that the Christian system is already</p>

<p begin="01:34:48.709" end="01:34:56.449" style="s2">would to sort of throw it off balance or</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.929" end="01:34:58.969" style="s2">throw it off kilter right so one is</p>

<p begin="01:34:58.969" end="01:35:05.239" style="s2">synthesis in nishitani and the other is</p>

<p begin="01:35:08.179" end="01:35:15.829" style="s2">towards the same message yes yep yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.289" end="01:35:18.919" style="s2">the the big metaphor of the perennial is</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.829" end="01:35:21.800" style="s2">school is the multiple paths up the</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.919" end="01:35:24.289" style="s2">mountain you can be a mountain climber</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.800" end="01:35:26.959" style="s2">and you can choose any number of</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.289" end="01:35:30.500" style="s2">different trails and still reach the</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.959" end="01:35:33.080" style="s2">summit of the mountain and</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.500" end="01:35:34.940" style="s2">the fact that you took one trail and not</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.080" end="01:35:38.840" style="s2">another doesn&#39;t negate that the other</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.940" end="01:35:42.020" style="s2">trail takes you up the mountain and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.840" end="01:35:44.660" style="s2">the the perennial is you the various</p>

<p begin="01:35:47.300" end="01:35:55.040" style="s2">established and well trodden so that one</p>

<p begin="01:35:55.040" end="01:36:01.460" style="s2">get to the destination whereas nishitani</p>

<p begin="01:36:01.460" end="01:36:07.540" style="s2">metaphor is much more to sort of find</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.870" end="01:36:11.840" style="s2">your own way up the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.540" end="01:36:15.410" style="s2">existentially and to perhaps take</p>

<p begin="01:38:45.110" end="01:38:50.390" style="s2">from adventure time that you know</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.199" end="01:38:53.030" style="s2">thought was was relevant did you want to</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.390" end="01:38:57.100" style="s2">say a little bit about why what you like</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.030" end="01:39:00.429" style="s2">about in what you just why you shared it</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.100" end="01:39:00.429" style="s2">can you hear me</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.550" end="01:39:09.640" style="s2">I it&#39;s actually two a little bit earlier</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.660" end="01:39:12.440" style="s2">in the conversation but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.640" end="01:39:16.370" style="s2">better to just listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.440" end="01:39:21.920" style="s2">and then get a little bit what you like</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.370" end="01:39:28.070" style="s2">first but I guess yeah it&#39;s not far</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.920" end="01:39:30.440" style="s2">right away yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.070" end="01:39:32.750" style="s2">heard some of the the music from that</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.440" end="01:39:35.570" style="s2">show and it&#39;s kind of kind of wild how</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.750" end="01:39:38.240" style="s2">how deep and emotive it is for</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.570" end="01:39:40.280" style="s2">ostensibly a children&#39;s show so I</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.240" end="01:39:42.070" style="s2">definitely had it come up in in</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.280" end="01:39:45.050" style="s2">similarly spiritual and philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.070" end="01:39:50.690" style="s2">discussions before so I&#39;m I&#39;m sure it</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.050" end="01:39:53.300" style="s2">has something to add here so oh good</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.690" end="01:39:55.400" style="s2">no I was just gonna ask if if anyone who</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.300" end="01:39:57.110" style="s2">hasn&#39;t asked a question yet wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.400" end="01:39:59.600" style="s2">ask one but if you but continue</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.110" end="01:40:01.700" style="s2">answering and yeah I shouldn&#39;t I can</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.600" end="01:40:04.190" style="s2">probably take like one or two more</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.700" end="01:40:07.100" style="s2">questions if people have them my voice</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.190" end="01:40:09.590" style="s2">is reaching the end of its stamina here</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.100" end="01:40:11.870" style="s2">so no it&#39;s been great really appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.590" end="01:40:13.850" style="s2">this so is there anyone first you who</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.870" end="01:40:17.980" style="s2">hasn&#39;t asked a question yet who would</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.850" end="01:40:17.980" style="s2">like to ask a question or make a comment</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.290" end="01:40:29.610" style="s2">is there anyone who has asked the</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.970" end="01:40:32.970" style="s2">question who wants to ask one last go</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.610" end="01:40:34.860" style="s2">ahead yeah it&#39;s actually quite a short</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.970" end="01:40:36.690" style="s2">one I don&#39;t know maybe I died I lost</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.860" end="01:40:40.230" style="s2">Sandra but maybe inadvertently on Sid of</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.690" end="01:40:42.840" style="s2">that in a my question is okay so</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.230" end="01:40:46.770" style="s2">nishitani he has being a nothingness as</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.840" end="01:40:48.920" style="s2">real so what is the opposite of real to</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.770" end="01:40:48.920" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.440" end="01:40:57.030" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question yeah so he uses</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.230" end="01:40:59.910" style="s2">the term illusion occasionally and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.030" end="01:41:04.020" style="s2">really drawing on dharmic philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.910" end="01:41:06.600" style="s2">here and I think he does actually relate</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.020" end="01:41:09.540" style="s2">it to the the term Maya out of out of</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.600" end="01:41:14.580" style="s2">Hinduism and Buddhism as as this</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.540" end="01:41:17.280" style="s2">illusion but like everything these</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.580" end="01:41:22.470" style="s2">opposites of realness and illusion are</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.280" end="01:41:25.980" style="s2">our mutually dependent and mutually</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.470" end="01:41:29.370" style="s2">created and arising so when things</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.980" end="01:41:33.480" style="s2">appear to us on our our field of of</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.370" end="01:41:38.250" style="s2">cognition and we relate to them solely</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.480" end="01:41:41.070" style="s2">through means of substance and relating</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.250" end="01:41:44.250" style="s2">back to ourselves there&#39;s there is an</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.070" end="01:41:48.300" style="s2">aspect of illusion in there since we</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.250" end="01:41:53.610" style="s2">have dramatically limited the scope of</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.300" end="01:41:59.780" style="s2">that encounter due to being really bound</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.610" end="01:42:03.450" style="s2">up tightly in in this process of</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.780" end="01:42:06.090" style="s2">understanding ourselves as these</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.450" end="01:42:13.440" style="s2">cognitive agents divorced from from the</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.090" end="01:42:17.460" style="s2">world in such a way yeah so in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.440" end="01:42:22.560" style="s2">non reality I&#39;d say it definitely goes</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.460" end="01:42:25.740" style="s2">back to this this idea of Maya from from</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.560" end="01:42:31.950" style="s2">Buddhism but he he doesn&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.740" end="01:42:34.440" style="s2">to make the world into an illusion in an</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.950" end="01:42:38.850" style="s2">aesthetics nor Gnostic sort of sense he</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.440" end="01:42:42.570" style="s2">he wants a really deeply real contact to</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.850" end="01:42:45.300" style="s2">to be able to come to the to the fore in</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.570" end="01:42:48.150" style="s2">that and I think this is where he kind</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.300" end="01:42:50.310" style="s2">of departs from a lot of traditional</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.150" end="01:42:53.100" style="s2">Buddhist thinking is I don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.310" end="01:42:55.680" style="s2">even really would say this the self is</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.100" end="01:42:58.170" style="s2">is fundamentally an illusion our</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.680" end="01:43:01.820" style="s2">conception of the self and our our</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.170" end="01:43:01.820" style="s2">attachment to the self is an illusion</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.489" end="01:43:11.010" style="s2">like any other entity it the self is is</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.630" end="01:43:13.459" style="s2">this thing that is codependent on all</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.010" end="01:43:16.619" style="s2">other things and derives its its reality</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.459" end="01:43:19.889" style="s2">from them so I which is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.619" end="01:43:22.489" style="s2">necessarily a nun Buddhist conception of</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.889" end="01:43:26.130" style="s2">it in terms of it being this codependent</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.489" end="01:43:28.949" style="s2">origination I not in a highly causal</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.130" end="01:43:33.150" style="s2">sort of system that is at the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.949" end="01:43:36.510" style="s2">the self but yeah the idea of a real</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.150" end="01:43:40.010" style="s2">self hood is is is is is there a new</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.510" end="01:43:40.010" style="s2">sheet Ani in an important way</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.070" end="01:43:45.010" style="s2">okay thanks to the answer yeah maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.309" end="01:43:49.340" style="s2">could close with one last question</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.010" end="01:43:51.559" style="s2">related to how we should approach an</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.340" end="01:43:52.909" style="s2">author like this from a lay person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.559" end="01:43:56.239" style="s2">point of view I mean not everyone has a</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.909" end="01:43:58.849" style="s2">philosophy degree not everyone is deeply</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.239" end="01:44:00.860" style="s2">embedded in all the you know the three</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.849" end="01:44:02.989" style="s2">or four books John said you should have</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.860" end="01:44:06.369" style="s2">even more even thinking of reading this</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.989" end="01:44:09.230" style="s2">book you know so how should a layperson</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.369" end="01:44:12.289" style="s2">approach whether deciding to read these</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.230" end="01:44:14.420" style="s2">books or how to get something out of it</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.289" end="01:44:17.420" style="s2">without you know we all have limited</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.420" end="01:44:20.570" style="s2">time and know most people can&#39;t just do</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.420" end="01:44:25.369" style="s2">a philosophy degree now yeah even in a</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.570" end="01:44:27.469" style="s2">sort of autodidactic way so so so so so</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.369" end="01:44:29.960" style="s2">first how should we approach it and if</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.469" end="01:44:31.969" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of a key practical point</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.960" end="01:44:34.340" style="s2">that you think a layperson should take</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.969" end="01:44:34.750" style="s2">from this work mm-hmm what what would it</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.340" end="01:44:38.329" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.750" end="01:44:41.539" style="s2">yeah in terms of approaching it I mean</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.329" end="01:44:44.329" style="s2">you certainly could just try and throw</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.539" end="01:44:46.909" style="s2">yourself at this work without without</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.329" end="01:44:49.280" style="s2">all the all the background knowledge I</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.909" end="01:44:52.519" style="s2">certainly didn&#39;t didn&#39;t come to this</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.280" end="01:44:55.639" style="s2">having a super deep knowledge of William</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.519" end="01:44:59.000" style="s2">James for example so I mean you can</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.639" end="01:45:01.099" style="s2">still definitely get there even if you</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.000" end="01:45:04.880" style="s2">don&#39;t have all the the puzzle pieces in</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.099" end="01:45:07.550" style="s2">place in terms of practical suggestions</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.880" end="01:45:11.030" style="s2">for reading it if you do want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.550" end="01:45:14.059" style="s2">I&#39;d say take it a little bit at a time</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.030" end="01:45:17.469" style="s2">don&#39;t try and read a whole chapter in</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.059" end="01:45:23.019" style="s2">one sitting I really wouldn&#39;t recommend</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.469" end="01:45:27.019" style="s2">more than 10 20 pages in a sitting and</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.019" end="01:45:30.679" style="s2">the other thing I&#39;d recommend is to find</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.019" end="01:45:33.800" style="s2">some some friends to read it read it</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.679" end="01:45:37.309" style="s2">along with you and to discuss it as you</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.800" end="01:45:41.570" style="s2">go I think that can make up for a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.309" end="01:45:44.329" style="s2">our own individual lack of expertise and</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.570" end="01:45:48.330" style="s2">and lack of a comprehension of some of</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.329" end="01:45:51.570" style="s2">this so just being able to</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.330" end="01:45:54.210" style="s2">discuss it through and and reinforce</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.570" end="01:45:56.790" style="s2">some of our comprehension and and get</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.210" end="01:46:01.740" style="s2">new comprehension definitely I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.790" end="01:46:04.710" style="s2">I&#39;m I have no doubt that reading this</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.740" end="01:46:06.150" style="s2">with other people made it much more</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.710" end="01:46:08.550" style="s2">comprehensible than it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.150" end="01:46:11.940" style="s2">if I just tried to go through this this</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.550" end="01:46:15.900" style="s2">text on on on my own then the other</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.940" end="01:46:19.110" style="s2">thing is just don&#39;t be afraid to use</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.900" end="01:46:22.100" style="s2">some secondary sources the the one book</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.110" end="01:46:24.930" style="s2">I mentioned is a series of essays</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.100" end="01:46:28.170" style="s2">directly relating to religion</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.930" end="01:46:29.730" style="s2">nothingness trying to unpack various</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.170" end="01:46:33.360" style="s2">aspects of it so that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.730" end="01:46:38.250" style="s2">helpful but there&#39;s a lot of stuff on on</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.360" end="01:46:40.860" style="s2">Google Scholar on academia.edu which is</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.250" end="01:46:44.040" style="s2">it should be accessible so I probably</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.860" end="01:46:47.160" style="s2">have like a digital library of like 30</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.040" end="01:46:49.350" style="s2">or so articles of various things</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.160" end="01:46:52.020" style="s2">relating to Tunisia Thani here so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.350" end="01:46:56.100" style="s2">it&#39;s out there if you if you are looking</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.020" end="01:46:57.510" style="s2">for a really specific aspect of its</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.100" end="01:46:59.990" style="s2">thought like people are people are</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.510" end="01:47:02.910" style="s2">writing about it it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.990" end="01:47:05.700" style="s2">confined to the ivory tower of academia</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.910" end="01:47:10.590" style="s2">but if you if you have your your various</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.700" end="01:47:12.810" style="s2">inroads for traversing such a space you</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.590" end="01:47:17.610" style="s2">can you can get get what you need to get</p>
