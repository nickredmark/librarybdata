<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:18.600" style="s2">podcast livestream our 23rd Q &amp; A where</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:22.350" style="s2">I have just been alerted that revenge is</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.600" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">a dish best served live so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.350" end="00:00:28.349" style="s2">coming up I don&#39;t know when but what</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.090" style="s2">happened okay maybe I misinterpreted it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.349" end="00:00:31.830" style="s2">but that&#39;s how it sounded and it came</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.090" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">with that certain glint in the eye so</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be on my guard yeah hide</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:40.860" style="s2">your toes right yes exactly</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">toes all right once again thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">everyone for supporting us for the super</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">check questions we have more questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">that we will get through and we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:51.449" style="s2">through as many as possible knowing full</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.340" style="s2">well that there are many good ones that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.449" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">we don&#39;t we appreciate all of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.340" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">comments of support as well and so as</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">usual we start by doing about a half an</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">hour or so of super check questions from</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">the first live stream in which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">prioritized them based on the amount</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">only and then we will go to super check</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">questions from this current live stream</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">and and read them in the order in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">they come in but feeling free to skip</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">any that seemed inappropriate or rude or</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:21.570" style="s2">just outward their time for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">reason although it&#39;s very rare that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:27.180" style="s2">last thing happens here yep okay first</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">question I am building a Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.180" end="00:01:30.210" style="s2">alternative focused on serving media and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">user comments that challenged</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.210" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">individuals existing biases and allow</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">discrete voting on content what changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">to Twitter&#39;s design would most improve</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">online discourse and understanding hmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:47.189" style="s2">well I see two things okay and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">they&#39;re one thing just two forms but the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.189" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">thing that&#39;s killing us is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">combination of the algorithm that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:58.890" style="s2">are steered by and the inability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">check what it is I mean even the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.890" end="00:02:05.490" style="s2">that it&#39;s in motion and I am I have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">so struck by the fact that there is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.490" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">maybe the most important thing we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">be doing is have a field of people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">reverse engineering the algorithm by hat</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:14.100" style="s2">setting up accounts and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">what its fee</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">so that we could perhaps keep our heads</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">above water but I never see this so my</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">point to you would be if you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">a Twitter alternative you got your work</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">cut out for you but to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">there is some algorithm that decides</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">what you see and don&#39;t see a it has to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">be transparent and really at some level</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">I think we are going to have to require</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">that these algorithms become transparent</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:44.310" style="s2">otherwise the derangement of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">civilization will be so dangerous to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.310" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:50.310" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously legal and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:52.110" style="s2">questions about forcing private</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.310" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">companies to reveal their algorithms but</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.110" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">civilization appears to depend on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:56.880" style="s2">fact that we know what the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:02:58.350" style="s2">are but if you&#39;re building an</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.880" end="00:03:00.330" style="s2">alternative today and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.350" end="00:03:02.820" style="s2">attract attention of people like us I</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.330" end="00:03:07.080" style="s2">would say if there&#39;s an algorithm it</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.820" end="00:03:09.630" style="s2">should be based on a transparent method</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.080" end="00:03:11.160" style="s2">and that there should be sliders one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.630" end="00:03:13.850" style="s2">the things I would constantly be doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.160" end="00:03:17.340" style="s2">if I had access to it is tuning into</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.850" end="00:03:19.530" style="s2">what my antithesis sees on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.340" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">tuning in to what somebody who&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.530" end="00:03:24.960" style="s2">middle see is on Twitter if I could draw</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">version we have is so so blunt only oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.960" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">I&#39;m going to go to that person&#39;s feed</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">that&#39;s it that is as far as I know the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">only version of such a slider that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:33.660" style="s2">have right yeah and it&#39;s not even really</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.400" style="s2">a slider what I want to know is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.660" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing that causes them to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.400" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">produce that feed by saying these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">and retweeting those things I want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">see you want to be able to see the feeds</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:44.910" style="s2">of people whose feeds you can see I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">look I want to look through their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.910" end="00:03:51.480" style="s2">yeah right and frankly I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.460" style="s2">something I think I don&#39;t think I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.480" end="00:03:55.320" style="s2">that yeah I mean we&#39;re not to use it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.460" end="00:03:57.600" style="s2">though no my point is I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.320" end="00:04:00.030" style="s2">people being able to see everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.600" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">I&#39;m choosing to look at oh that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.030" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">what I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is I want you to be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:06.390" style="s2">to choose the sliders to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">the thing is feeding you stuff I want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.390" end="00:04:10.710" style="s2">be able to say well okay if you know if</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.450" end="00:04:13.050" style="s2">I want to see what the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.710" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">perspective is my sliders over here if I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.050" end="00:04:15.420" style="s2">want to shunt it over to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.040" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">conservative what would I be seeing if</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.420" end="00:04:18.330" style="s2">it thought I was a conservative what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">would I be seeing in the middle that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.330" end="00:04:21.630" style="s2">kind of thing so it&#39;s a generic thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:22.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not looking at what it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:24.689" style="s2">interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want that at all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.689" end="00:04:27.659" style="s2">I mean I think you know that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:28.889" style="s2">new problem which is you know how is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.659" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">deciding what liberal is what</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.889" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">conservative is you know how is you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:34.439" style="s2">there&#39;s still something built-in as to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">what it is you know what what those</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.439" end="00:04:39.990" style="s2">labels mean but I think what seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">true and I haven&#39;t thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.990" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">enough recently to remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.000" style="s2">terms are but Twitter has these two</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:47.310" style="s2">distinct settings where you can let it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.000" end="00:04:48.599" style="s2">curate for you or you can say just show</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.310" end="00:04:50.759" style="s2">me everything give me a chronological</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.599" end="00:04:53.810" style="s2">feed based on you know if I follow them</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.759" end="00:04:56.219" style="s2">and they&#39;ve tweeted let me see it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.810" end="00:04:58.139" style="s2">you know I certainly have it on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.219" end="00:05:00.120" style="s2">second setting they give me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.139" end="00:05:02.039" style="s2">chronological feed do not do editing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.120" end="00:05:04.409" style="s2">my behalf Twitter and yet it is clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.039" end="00:05:06.590" style="s2">that it is editing on my behalf as per</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.409" end="00:05:09.449" style="s2">our conversation in the last hour so</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.590" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">what what is it it clearly is not what</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.449" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">it is named and it&#39;s not what it appears</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:17.009" style="s2">like so much in the world right now so</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:22.949" style="s2">um I would just say to encapsulate we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.009" end="00:05:24.539" style="s2">have a problem where AI and the steering</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.949" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">problem that is to say the potential</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.539" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">that AI will run away and become an</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">existential threat is already alive and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:34.319" style="s2">well as happening we expected robots</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.120" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t robots so we don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.319" end="00:05:37.740" style="s2">happening it&#39;s algorithms they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.120" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">it to us we&#39;re destroying ourselves on</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.740" end="00:05:44.279" style="s2">the basis that it is driving us insane</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">the key thing is to be able to figure</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.279" end="00:05:48.599" style="s2">out where other people are getting their</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:49.889" style="s2">information in their perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.599" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">order that we can have those</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">become impossible and I would just point</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.779" style="s2">out if you think back you&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">there used to be a Google search right</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.779" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">then there was Google search that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">personal which you could turn off which</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:08.729" style="s2">still didn&#39;t tell you anything because</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:09.990" style="s2">since almost everybody had it on it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.729" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">wasn&#39;t clear what you were looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.990" end="00:06:13.349" style="s2">having it turned off but at least it</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.690" style="s2">wasn&#39;t personal and then we lost the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.349" end="00:06:17.879" style="s2">ability altogether right you have to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.690" end="00:06:20.370" style="s2">have to unlock yourself in in every way</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.879" end="00:06:21.599" style="s2">that can possibly be done and even so</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.370" end="00:06:23.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear to me that if you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.599" end="00:06:25.020" style="s2">computer that already knows who you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.190" end="00:06:26.460" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually turning off the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.020" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">ability of Google to know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.460" end="00:06:30.029" style="s2">right and even if you do what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:32.009" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing if nobody else is tuned</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.029" end="00:06:33.630" style="s2">into a depersonalized feed what are you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.009" end="00:06:37.110" style="s2">even what is that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.630" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an it&#39;s an empty experience so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.110" end="00:06:44.250" style="s2">anyway yeah transparency and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.190" end="00:06:46.980" style="s2">to play around so that you can tune into</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.250" end="00:06:48.420" style="s2">the mind of somebody else by switching</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.980" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">the sliders to what you expect that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.420" end="00:06:55.350" style="s2">would have be very useful next question</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.130" end="00:06:56.820" style="s2">comment I disapprove of what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.350" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">say but I will defend to the death your</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.820" end="00:07:00.060" style="s2">right not to say it thank you both for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:03.390" style="s2">defending free speech and promoting</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.060" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">nuanced thoughts thought pretty cool I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.390" end="00:07:08.070" style="s2">like the formulation yeah I do too I</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:09.690" style="s2">question three</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:11.580" style="s2">I have interested with many people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.690" end="00:07:13.710" style="s2">have experienced incarceration I have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.580" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">critical and skeptical mind the police</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.710" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">routinely abused their power how would</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">you suggest fixing the systemic issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.780" end="00:07:24.540" style="s2">hmm great question great question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">going to deserve a podcast of its own at</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.540" end="00:07:30.930" style="s2">some point but what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:33.060" style="s2">consider the following proposition the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.930" end="00:07:35.580" style="s2">policing we have the policing we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.060" end="00:07:38.940" style="s2">which is routinely abused that is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.580" end="00:07:41.490" style="s2">feature not a bug is a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.940" end="00:07:43.820" style="s2">something else if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.490" end="00:07:46.380" style="s2">share if you don&#39;t want to share</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.820" end="00:07:49.170" style="s2">opportunity and you concentrate that</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.380" end="00:07:50.910" style="s2">opportunity then you end up with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.170" end="00:07:54.030" style="s2">need to control people so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.910" end="00:07:58.530" style="s2">rebel against an unfair distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.030" end="00:08:01.260" style="s2">of access so the place to cure this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.530" end="00:08:04.010" style="s2">not at the police level right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.260" end="00:08:06.300" style="s2">just going to end up with kludgy</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.010" end="00:08:08.460" style="s2">attempted fixes that don&#39;t work and have</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.300" end="00:08:10.380" style="s2">unintended consequences what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.460" end="00:08:13.440" style="s2">do is fix the underlying problem which</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.380" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">of course has a small number of very</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.440" end="00:08:18.420" style="s2">very powerful antagonists the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:20.190" style="s2">you would solve the opportunity problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.420" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">is going to be opposed by those who have</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.190" end="00:08:25.500" style="s2">hoarded opportunity so that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:27.690" style="s2">question we need to solve and until you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.500" end="00:08:30.060" style="s2">do that I don&#39;t think the police issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.690" end="00:08:31.740" style="s2">is addressable in isolation yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.060" end="00:08:33.479" style="s2">probably right I wish I had access to</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.740" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">what I saw some time in the last week</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.479" end="00:08:39.390" style="s2">some analysis has suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:42.410" style="s2">actually body cams are not demonstrably</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.390" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">effective in reducing police brutality</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.410" end="00:08:49.430" style="s2">so given that I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">having cameras in precincts having you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.430" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">know everything that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:09:00.230" style="s2">places where would-be perpetrators are</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:03.320" style="s2">being brought in and and and treated and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.230" end="00:09:05.779" style="s2">put in jail and such might help I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.320" end="00:09:07.459" style="s2">I cannot quite make sense of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.779" end="00:09:09.890" style="s2">the conclusion that body cams don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.459" end="00:09:12.770" style="s2">reduce police brutality but this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.890" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">apparently a robust conclusion yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.770" end="00:09:15.980" style="s2">seems they would and it seems that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:17.570" style="s2">are an extension of the same phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.980" end="00:09:19.399" style="s2">if everybody&#39;s got a camera and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.570" end="00:09:22.459" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is outrage that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.399" end="00:09:23.930" style="s2">obviously going to have impacts body</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.459" end="00:09:26.180" style="s2">cams which seemed to point the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.930" end="00:09:28.250" style="s2">direction but yeah and you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.180" end="00:09:31.250" style="s2">the same eye this isn&#39;t the same but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.250" end="00:09:32.810" style="s2">had a related question watching that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:36.200" style="s2">first video that we showed in the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.810" end="00:09:38.779" style="s2">hour you know the two minutes of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.200" end="00:09:41.810" style="s2">know peaceable assembly of protesters</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.779" end="00:09:45.080" style="s2">with a black man speaking honestly and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.810" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">and truthfully to the police and having</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.080" end="00:09:49.010" style="s2">them come in and take him away like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.910" end="00:09:50.510" style="s2">police knew that was being recorded yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.010" end="00:09:53.330" style="s2">like even more so what the hell were</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.510" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">they doing 9 suppose going on I have the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.330" end="00:09:58.550" style="s2">same er what could possibly have gone</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:10:00.230" style="s2">through their minds yeah yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.550" end="00:10:01.790" style="s2">you guys have been a lifeline of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.230" end="00:10:04.580" style="s2">rationality many thanks from an American</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.790" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">expat in the UK thank you about your</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.580" end="00:10:09.620" style="s2">answer to the question in the last</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:11.240" style="s2">podcast do you believe that Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.620" end="00:10:13.700" style="s2">philosophy is driving any of this so</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.240" end="00:10:15.500" style="s2">that was asked in the last podcast last</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.700" end="00:10:17.420" style="s2">Q&amp;A and we answered it wouldn&#39;t it be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.500" end="00:10:20.150" style="s2">better answer that mark you seein as an</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.420" end="00:10:24.440" style="s2">aberrant mark use philosophy is driving</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.150" end="00:10:27.080" style="s2">this I do think I couldn&#39;t tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.440" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">names of any of Mark uses works but he</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.080" end="00:10:33.110" style="s2">is one of the people sort of early on in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">what becomes post-modernism along with</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.110" end="00:10:41.420" style="s2">Foucault and Derrida and such whoo-hoo</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">yes I actually do tend to point more to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.420" end="00:10:48.200" style="s2">the postmoderns and particular the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:50.750" style="s2">French postmoderns than to Marx it all</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.200" end="00:10:52.370" style="s2">gets cloaked in this Marxist philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.750" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">and as you talked about in your answer</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.370" end="00:10:57.650" style="s2">last time you know Marxism doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">but it&#39;s a coherent it&#39;s a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.650" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">philosophy and there&#39;s much to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.850" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:03.150" style="s2">knowing what it says yes I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a coherent critique not a cohan</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.150" end="00:11:10.590" style="s2">okay good it&#39;s a coherent critique and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:12.930" style="s2">it is being trotted out by people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.590" end="00:11:14.700" style="s2">know the name Marx who have pictures of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.930" end="00:11:17.250" style="s2">Marx it&#39;s lots of marks on their</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.700" end="00:11:19.800" style="s2">t-shirts and all and so they think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.250" end="00:11:21.660" style="s2">they&#39;re Marxists and being accused of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.800" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">being for kody ins or Marcuse ian&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.660" end="00:11:25.830" style="s2">their post modernists sounds less like</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:27.180" style="s2">something they would recognize and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.830" end="00:11:29.820" style="s2">take umbrage in a way they don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.180" end="00:11:31.170" style="s2">Enbridge at being called Marxists but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.820" end="00:11:33.750" style="s2">agree I don&#39;t think this isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.170" end="00:11:37.950" style="s2">Marxist it&#39;s much more of a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.750" end="00:11:39.390" style="s2">set of ideologies mmm I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.950" end="00:11:41.850" style="s2">gonna push back slightly I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.390" end="00:11:45.540" style="s2">it certainly has elements of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.850" end="00:11:49.080" style="s2">post-modernism it it is uh what is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.540" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">the Sokol squared term for it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.080" end="00:11:53.190" style="s2">functionally postmodern maybe that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:55.380" style="s2">the term but it&#39;s a grievance studies</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.190" end="00:11:58.350" style="s2">guys yeah it&#39;s functionally postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.380" end="00:12:01.050" style="s2">most these people don&#39;t know the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.350" end="00:12:03.030" style="s2">post-modernism that they are enacting or</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.050" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">enacting it anyway we probably haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.030" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">read the communist manifesto either all</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:07.500" style="s2">right and that was that was gonna be my</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.900" style="s2">point is that I think we could tie</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.500" end="00:12:11.850" style="s2">ourselves in knots trying to be precise</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.900" end="00:12:15.570" style="s2">about what this movement is and what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.850" end="00:12:17.460" style="s2">will find out is you know is it Marx as</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.570" end="00:12:21.300" style="s2">well its Maoist Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.460" end="00:12:24.930" style="s2">it&#39;s postmodern its new hip happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.300" end="00:12:28.380" style="s2">it&#39;s all sorts of stuff so it&#39;s hip</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.930" end="00:12:31.260" style="s2">happening Marxist and I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.380" end="00:12:33.030" style="s2">important not to get bogged down in it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.260" end="00:12:35.310" style="s2">it&#39;s got enough Marxism in it that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.030" end="00:12:37.170" style="s2">deserves to be in the discussion okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.310" end="00:12:39.450" style="s2">it&#39;s got enough post-modernism that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:41.750" style="s2">deserves to be in the discussion it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.450" end="00:12:44.870" style="s2">novel enough that it deserves not to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.750" end="00:12:49.280" style="s2">portrayed as exactly one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.870" end="00:12:52.530" style="s2">but I feel like post modernist thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.280" end="00:12:55.050" style="s2">renewed the ability for Marxist thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.530" end="00:12:58.430" style="s2">to get a foothold in the universities</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.050" end="00:13:01.230" style="s2">where these ideas are emerging from that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.430" end="00:13:03.470" style="s2">Marxism especially in the wake of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.230" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">Cultural Revolution in the 70s and China</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.470" end="00:13:10.530" style="s2">was most was really a backroom niche</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:13.089" style="s2">belief that was easy to get rid of just</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.530" end="00:13:14.829" style="s2">like actual racism you know white now</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.089" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to scoff at now we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.829" end="00:13:21.309" style="s2">encouraged to do so and for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:23.079" style="s2">and I think that you know a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.309" end="00:13:24.189" style="s2">of a little bit of information in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.079" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">hands of some people who don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.189" end="00:13:28.209" style="s2">know what they&#39;re wielding cuz I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:29.619" style="s2">there there are important truths there</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.209" end="00:13:32.589" style="s2">kernels of things that are valuable</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.619" end="00:13:37.019" style="s2">within postmodern thought and yet you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.589" end="00:13:39.579" style="s2">combine an unknown Stan ie view of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.019" end="00:13:41.649" style="s2">post-modernism is proclaiming there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.579" end="00:13:43.509" style="s2">no objective reality and your truth is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.649" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">your truth and my truth is mine and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.509" end="00:13:47.499" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if they ever meet but</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:51.339" style="s2">it&#39;s you know my truth is my truth you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.499" end="00:13:52.929" style="s2">combine that with a you know with a I</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.339" end="00:13:54.339" style="s2">don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s a naive</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.929" end="00:13:56.049" style="s2">understanding of Marxism but you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.339" end="00:13:57.879" style="s2">some kind of version of Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.049" end="00:14:00.329" style="s2">you&#39;re allowed to forget history you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.879" end="00:14:02.739" style="s2">allowed to forget that never once has</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.329" end="00:14:05.739" style="s2">Marxist revolution gone anywhere good</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.739" end="00:14:08.439" style="s2">well you&#39;re allowed to overwrite reality</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.739" end="00:14:12.220" style="s2">with stuff that is useful basically the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.439" end="00:14:14.199" style="s2">point is it&#39;s license to pen useful</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.220" end="00:14:17.379" style="s2">myths but the problem is you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.199" end="00:14:19.149" style="s2">license to pen miss on all of our behalf</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.379" end="00:14:21.459" style="s2">and so people are pen and myths on</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.149" end="00:14:23.470" style="s2">behalf of this group or that group were</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.459" end="00:14:25.419" style="s2">self or whatever and it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.470" end="00:14:27.160" style="s2">extremely dangerous process which has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.419" end="00:14:29.319" style="s2">lot to do with why this looks like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.160" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">religious awakening which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.319" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">really it&#39;s the opposite of an awakening</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:41.339" style="s2">it&#39;s an asleep inning somehow but</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:44.439" style="s2">nonetheless those who are true believers</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.339" end="00:14:46.779" style="s2">feel that they have just experienced</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.439" end="00:14:52.360" style="s2">enlightenment even as they have become</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.779" end="00:14:53.379" style="s2">unmoored from reality yes next question</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.360" end="00:14:55.569" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.379" end="00:14:57.249" style="s2">humans have primate brains designed for</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.569" end="00:14:59.259" style="s2">social systems rather than logic or</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.249" end="00:15:00.610" style="s2">reason when stressed we abandon</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.259" end="00:15:02.410" style="s2">higher-order thinking in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.610" end="00:15:04.540" style="s2">implicit models which ask who is at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.410" end="00:15:07.949" style="s2">bottom these folks will receive the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.540" end="00:15:12.910" style="s2">worst of any quota based policing I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.949" end="00:15:15.549" style="s2">think I think this is likely the only</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.910" end="00:15:18.220" style="s2">thing that I will take issue with here</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.549" end="00:15:19.689" style="s2">is that I primate you know it says</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.220" end="00:15:21.369" style="s2">humans of primate brains designed for</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.689" end="00:15:24.669" style="s2">social systems rather than logic or</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.369" end="00:15:25.390" style="s2">reason and all the other primates or you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.669" end="00:15:27.180" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.390" end="00:15:30.580" style="s2">more closely primates are related to us</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.180" end="00:15:33.580" style="s2">that are extent the more likely they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.580" end="00:15:36.550" style="s2">to also show logic and reason and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.580" end="00:15:38.830" style="s2">compassion and emotional regulation and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.550" end="00:15:40.510" style="s2">what we are seeing for sure is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.830" end="00:15:43.060" style="s2">breakdown of logic and reason and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.510" end="00:15:47.020" style="s2">dehumanization and a lack of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.060" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">and empathy for other people but we also</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.020" end="00:15:50.920" style="s2">see that in in the great apes and many</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:53.580" style="s2">of the old world monkeys in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.920" end="00:15:56.230" style="s2">like baboons and in large social groups</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.580" end="00:15:58.390" style="s2">that they have they are collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.230" end="00:16:02.230" style="s2">and they are competitive as are we I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.390" end="00:16:05.830" style="s2">would add that there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.230" end="00:16:09.310" style="s2">between what is true and social reality</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.830" end="00:16:12.280" style="s2">and very frequently human beings do one</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.310" end="00:16:14.230" style="s2">more from a strict adherence to factual</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.280" end="00:16:15.430" style="s2">reality in order to accomplish something</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.230" end="00:16:18.370" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have the tools for</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.430" end="00:16:21.550" style="s2">presently or that requires mythologizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.370" end="00:16:23.740" style="s2">things and the thing here is we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.550" end="00:16:25.090" style="s2">project forward we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.740" end="00:16:28.180" style="s2">consequence of the myths that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.090" end="00:16:30.520" style="s2">being fed in this case are right this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.180" end="00:16:33.190" style="s2">going to advance certain people as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.520" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">hobbles other people and then collapse</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.190" end="00:16:39.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s coming so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:41.170" style="s2">that you want to see some groups rise at</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.610" end="00:16:42.730" style="s2">the expense of other groups and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.170" end="00:16:44.710" style="s2">willing to pay the price of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.730" end="00:16:46.860" style="s2">this seems like a good deal to any of us</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.710" end="00:16:50.140" style="s2">who feel like we&#39;ve made progress</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.860" end="00:16:53.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot yet to go but it sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.140" end="00:16:55.840" style="s2">would be a shame to go backwards the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.230" end="00:16:58.660" style="s2">idea that you would invite collapse is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.840" end="00:17:00.550" style="s2">ludicrous now I would point out you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.660" end="00:17:02.500" style="s2">gonna hear a lot about people like me</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.550" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">are gonna say this is an anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.500" end="00:17:06.370" style="s2">revolution others are gonna say yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:08.260" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what anarchism means</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.370" end="00:17:08.920" style="s2">you&#39;re using it as if you mean chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.260" end="00:17:11.260" style="s2">no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.920" end="00:17:13.750" style="s2">I mean anarchism this is anarchism</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:16.150" style="s2">they&#39;re on inventing government they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.750" end="00:17:17.260" style="s2">wrong about the consecrate to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.150" end="00:17:19.390" style="s2">that they are honest about what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.260" end="00:17:21.670" style="s2">think will happen next they are dead</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.390" end="00:17:23.380" style="s2">wrong and we cannot we cannot afford to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.670" end="00:17:25.030" style="s2">demonstrate that to them by allowing</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.300" end="00:17:33.910" style="s2">from about a dozen videos of police</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:42.669" style="s2">it&#39;s an excellent question and I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.299" end="00:17:44.259" style="s2">say yeah this isn&#39;t exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.669" end="00:17:45.639" style="s2">thing but I used to make the same point</p>

<p begin="00:18:51.279" end="00:18:54.730" style="s2">even you know you young college students</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.409" end="00:18:56.470" style="s2">who are presumably living more exciting</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.730" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">lives than many people you know what</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.470" end="00:18:59.049" style="s2">percentage of the time is anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:00.100" style="s2">actually interesting happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.049" end="00:19:01.779" style="s2">especially if people don&#39;t speak your</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.100" end="00:19:03.369" style="s2">language right as you don&#39;t speak the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.779" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">language of the ducks or the Beatles or</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.369" end="00:19:06.519" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re watching so</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.139" style="s2">this is this is exactly right and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.519" end="00:19:11.169" style="s2">brings us back to this point that we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.139" end="00:19:12.429" style="s2">the visceral anecdote is always going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.169" end="00:19:13.899" style="s2">attract our attention and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.429" end="00:19:15.909" style="s2">mean there&#39;s not something real to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.899" end="00:19:18.220" style="s2">learned from it because sometimes it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.909" end="00:19:20.679" style="s2">exactly the rare events that are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.220" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">forces of selection that cause the rest</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.679" end="00:19:26.379" style="s2">of the culture or the social system to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:30.249" style="s2">be what they are but the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.379" end="00:19:33.309" style="s2">are the thing that is true of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.249" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">individual or of a population is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.309" end="00:19:38.259" style="s2">correct yeah and in fact I mean as we</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:41.019" style="s2">described before there&#39;s a tool for this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.259" end="00:19:43.029" style="s2">right it&#39;s a statistical analysis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.019" end="00:19:44.860" style="s2">right and it you know if it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.029" end="00:19:47.769" style="s2">properly it will tell you whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.860" end="00:19:49.539" style="s2">your sense that this thing illustrates a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.769" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">bias that I know exists in that other</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.539" end="00:19:55.419" style="s2">thing you can test that question</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:57.700" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s a shame and we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.419" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">done ourselves no service by failing to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.700" end="00:20:01.269" style="s2">educate we I mean think about what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">done in the Universities we&#39;ve allowed</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.269" end="00:20:08.379" style="s2">people to get degrees in the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.580" end="00:20:10.690" style="s2">clear-headedness right why did we do</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.379" end="00:20:12.519" style="s2">that and then now that we&#39;ve got shield</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.690" end="00:20:13.750" style="s2">I mean ridiculousness we&#39;ve credentialed</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.519" end="00:20:14.740" style="s2">them in ridiculousness and now</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.750" end="00:20:17.919" style="s2">ridiculousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.740" end="00:20:20.169" style="s2">is staging a coup against reason and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.919" end="00:20:22.149" style="s2">are forced to take it seriously because</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.169" end="00:20:23.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what reasonable reasonable people</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.149" end="00:20:25.269" style="s2">do is they listen to other perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.500" end="00:20:26.980" style="s2">and a few critiques some of them they</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.269" end="00:20:29.220" style="s2">are outraged they are not really</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.980" end="00:20:31.809" style="s2">offended yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.220" end="00:20:33.250" style="s2">given the socio-cultural significance of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.809" end="00:20:35.379" style="s2">the algorithms selectively feeding us</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.250" end="00:20:37.539" style="s2">information do you imagine that Dorsey</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.379" end="00:20:38.889" style="s2">and Zuckerberg bond under the IDW and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.539" end="00:20:44.769" style="s2">can anything be done to combat these</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.889" end="00:20:47.620" style="s2">impersonal mechanical processes do they</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.769" end="00:20:48.399" style="s2">monitor the IDW I mean not them but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.620" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2">know is there any is there any</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.399" end="00:20:53.590" style="s2">monitoring in particular of our voices</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:55.750" style="s2">or other voices that are trying that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:20:59.590" style="s2">going against ideology yeah that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.750" end="00:21:02.139" style="s2">strictly along a set of received ways of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.590" end="00:21:04.600" style="s2">thinking I think lots of things are</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.139" end="00:21:06.279" style="s2">monitoring trends and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.600" end="00:21:08.889" style="s2">anything shows the ability to shift</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.279" end="00:21:11.799" style="s2">things it would be strange if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.889" end="00:21:13.509" style="s2">monitor and did not intervene and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.799" end="00:21:16.570" style="s2">know I we have the experience all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.509" end="00:21:19.629" style="s2">time of being approached on Twitter for</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.570" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">example by accounts that do not appear</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.629" end="00:21:25.269" style="s2">to be reasonable in other words if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:28.029" style="s2">look at the the profile and how old the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.269" end="00:21:30.250" style="s2">account is and how many followers it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.029" end="00:21:31.240" style="s2">and you look at the pattern the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.250" end="00:21:34.360" style="s2">do not look normal</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.240" end="00:21:36.730" style="s2">and so what is it that has decided to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.360" end="00:21:38.860" style="s2">reach out and inflame us or whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.730" end="00:21:40.269" style="s2">mean usually I noticed these things when</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.860" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">somebody says something completely off</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.269" end="00:21:43.179" style="s2">and I think how could anybody think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:45.309" style="s2">and then I go looking and I&#39;m like oh</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.179" end="00:21:47.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not on anybody it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.309" end="00:21:52.090" style="s2">an organic thought some thing decided to</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.830" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">to trigger an alarm sense by saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.090" end="00:21:57.429" style="s2">something that I would then think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:59.799" style="s2">is you know an idea in the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.429" end="00:22:01.779" style="s2">so but I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.799" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">that you come to that conclusion but not</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.779" end="00:22:05.830" style="s2">only did it take your time it took you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:07.690" style="s2">know you did spike</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.830" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">like it&#39;s impossible not to have some</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.690" end="00:22:10.570" style="s2">sort of an emotional spike when you see</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:11.769" style="s2">so yeah that&#39;s totally unreasonable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.570" end="00:22:13.779" style="s2">making a claim against you which you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.769" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">know a hundred percent to be false but</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.779" end="00:22:19.210" style="s2">it shows up in what was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">some sort of a good-faith engagement in</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.210" end="00:22:22.630" style="s2">which people disagree and people agree</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:26.590" style="s2">and they do so honorably and then this</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.630" end="00:22:29.470" style="s2">thing comes in and it&#39;s a success you</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.590" end="00:22:33.399" style="s2">know it is being successful even even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.470" end="00:22:35.649" style="s2">you can figure out what that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.399" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">organic that it isn&#39;t actually a real</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.649" end="00:22:39.669" style="s2">human being so the question specifically</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:41.500" style="s2">can anything be done</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.669" end="00:22:43.870" style="s2">to combat these impersonal mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.500" end="00:22:46.269" style="s2">processes yes and I&#39;ve advocated for</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.870" end="00:22:48.970" style="s2">something that then set a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.269" end="00:22:51.669" style="s2">a lot of accounts that I like on edge</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.970" end="00:22:55.120" style="s2">where I&#39;ve basically said that in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.669" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">environment anonymity is much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.120" end="00:22:58.600" style="s2">dangerous than it is valuable and people</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">have pointed out correctly that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.600" end="00:23:02.529" style="s2">are some very important events</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:04.389" style="s2">historically speaking in which the ball</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.529" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">was advanced by something anonymous and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.389" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">so who am I to go up against anonymity</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:12.279" style="s2">but my point would be that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:14.169" style="s2">people right now cannot speak I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.279" end="00:23:16.179" style="s2">speak what they know to be true because</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.169" end="00:23:18.370" style="s2">they&#39;re watching the world collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.179" end="00:23:20.440" style="s2">incoherence right we may lose their jobs</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.370" end="00:23:24.130" style="s2">but you could have a pseudonym Sudan</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.440" end="00:23:26.980" style="s2">Sudan on a system pseudonymous one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.130" end="00:23:32.529" style="s2">those two you could have such a system</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.980" end="00:23:35.669" style="s2">in which the platform basically had had</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.529" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">established who you were but that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.669" end="00:23:42.490" style="s2">were anonymous with respect to your the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:44.139" style="s2">front-facing part of your account yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.490" end="00:23:47.230" style="s2">but I would want to see it with some</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.139" end="00:23:49.269" style="s2">sort of there has to be accountability</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.230" end="00:23:50.830" style="s2">you know in other words somebody who can</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.269" end="00:23:53.049" style="s2">put together a dozen accounts that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.830" end="00:23:54.600" style="s2">throwaway accounts wreak a certain kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.049" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">of havoc advance a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.600" end="00:23:58.929" style="s2">opinion as if it was widely held that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:01.330" style="s2">very dangerous to our ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.929" end="00:24:06.039" style="s2">collectively so there has to be some</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.330" end="00:24:08.260" style="s2">sort of restriction of accounts so that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.039" end="00:24:11.019" style="s2">they begin to function like the people</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.260" end="00:24:12.760" style="s2">behind them right your reputation if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.019" end="00:24:14.049" style="s2">say something completely asinine and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.760" end="00:24:15.669" style="s2">can throw away the account and then you</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.049" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">go to a new account that isn&#39;t burdened</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.669" end="00:24:19.420" style="s2">by that cost to its reputation that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:20.740" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.420" end="00:24:22.660" style="s2">so in some sense there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:24.280" style="s2">limitation on number so the anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.660" end="00:24:28.810" style="s2">accounts don&#39;t proliferate there has to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.280" end="00:24:30.280" style="s2">be some ability for the asinine things</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.810" end="00:24:31.840" style="s2">that are said to actually follow the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.280" end="00:24:34.060" style="s2">person who said them for something</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.840" end="00:24:35.980" style="s2">that&#39;s insightful that said to you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.060" end="00:24:37.960" style="s2">create some kind of credibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.980" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">account it has to be it begin to behave</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.960" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">like a person because frankly and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:45.130" style="s2">is the part I think people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:49.090" style="s2">very easily the ability to be anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.130" end="00:24:50.650" style="s2">is new okay that did not exist in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.090" end="00:24:54.610" style="s2">ancestral environments until very</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.650" end="00:24:57.790" style="s2">recently so we are now dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.610" end="00:24:59.920" style="s2">consequences of this novel fact and the</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.540" end="00:26:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to see what happens when</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.550" end="00:26:50.690" style="s2">fixable liberals tend to do too much and</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.130" end="00:26:52.670" style="s2">they do not appreciate the unintended</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.290" end="00:27:00.290" style="s2">again so you know were there negative</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.490" end="00:27:02.840" style="s2">impacts of affirmative action oh you bet</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.290" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">there were and the harm that was done to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.840" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">people who would have thrived you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:11.000" style="s2">under any rubric was massive so we</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.190" style="s2">always have to be asking ourselves what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.000" end="00:27:15.590" style="s2">is even if we are well intentioned when</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.190" end="00:27:17.270" style="s2">we build one of these policies what kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.590" end="00:27:18.800" style="s2">of harm is going to come from it that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.270" end="00:27:20.420" style="s2">could foresee and is there something we</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.800" end="00:27:21.980" style="s2">can do to minimize it or does it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.420" end="00:27:23.420" style="s2">actually mean that the policy will be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.980" end="00:27:24.800" style="s2">failure in the end and that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.420" end="00:27:26.600" style="s2">do something else you can see this</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.800" end="00:27:29.630" style="s2">coming down the pike with reparations</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.600" end="00:27:32.600" style="s2">right reparations are an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.630" end="00:27:34.700" style="s2">disaster waiting to happen they will not</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.600" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">work and on the in the aftermath of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.700" end="00:27:40.370" style="s2">having delivered reparations what will</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:42.650" style="s2">society think of claims of there being</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.370" end="00:27:45.080" style="s2">some sort of structural problem so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.650" end="00:27:47.480" style="s2">so I mean there&#39;s this really does</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.080" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">require a long conversation I don&#39;t I am</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.480" end="00:27:55.130" style="s2">not well enough first nor have I thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:57.410" style="s2">sufficiently about this to know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.130" end="00:27:59.060" style="s2">what I think the answers are and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.410" end="00:28:02.330" style="s2">know I think it&#39;s there&#39;s no accident</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.060" end="00:28:04.580" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s easier to critique than</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.330" end="00:28:06.020" style="s2">to propose exactly what would be right</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.580" end="00:28:09.080" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.020" end="00:28:10.850" style="s2">world without any welfare makes sense I</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.080" end="00:28:14.060" style="s2">think a social safety net is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.850" end="00:28:18.740" style="s2">necessary in part to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.060" end="00:28:21.920" style="s2">effects of historic racism however what</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.740" end="00:28:23.990" style="s2">we have what we what we had growing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.920" end="00:28:25.700" style="s2">the 60s seems clearly to have been an</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.990" end="00:28:28.280" style="s2">overreach unintentional though it</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.700" end="00:28:32.050" style="s2">presumably was that probably caused some</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.280" end="00:28:32.050" style="s2">of the problems that we see today</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.220" end="00:28:37.239" style="s2">so next question I&#39;m just read this</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.869" end="00:28:38.409" style="s2">because I&#39;m we can&#39;t see what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.239" end="00:28:41.350" style="s2">referring to so you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.409" end="00:28:43.330" style="s2">another way to allow us to see this 6c</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.350" end="00:28:44.769" style="s2">chap for previous if you reorganize the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.330" end="00:28:46.239" style="s2">main chart from least to greatest risk</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.769" end="00:28:48.639" style="s2">of police death you have an index of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.239" end="00:28:51.999" style="s2">disposability it runs primarily along</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.639" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">gender than race so I can infer a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.999" end="00:28:54.909" style="s2">bit about what this might mean but we</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:57.580" style="s2">can&#39;t see the rest of it so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.909" end="00:28:59.529" style="s2">how to address it yeah I mean well I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.580" end="00:29:01.480" style="s2">say to the extent that we understand it</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.529" end="00:29:06.369" style="s2">it is I don&#39;t know whether this person</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.480" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">is reporting or predicting mmm sounds</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.369" end="00:29:09.580" style="s2">like they&#39;re reporting but if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:11.379" style="s2">if it&#39;s reporting then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.580" end="00:29:14.769" style="s2">question of where the methods right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.379" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">therefore the the pattern is meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.769" end="00:29:18.279" style="s2">in the way the person is suggesting and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:21.009" style="s2">if it&#39;s a prediction then the question</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.279" end="00:29:22.330" style="s2">is okay how would you have to do to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.009" end="00:29:25.450" style="s2">at data in order to know whether that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.330" end="00:29:27.700" style="s2">pattern was accurate and I mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.450" end="00:29:32.409" style="s2">one thing that I can I can infer clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.700" end="00:29:35.109" style="s2">here is that the nope no one argues that</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.409" end="00:29:37.330" style="s2">the fact that men are by far more likely</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.109" end="00:29:41.169" style="s2">to be arrested and incarcerated than</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.330" end="00:29:43.809" style="s2">women is due to misandry on the part of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.169" end="00:29:46.299" style="s2">the police that it is understood despite</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.809" end="00:29:48.009" style="s2">all of the crazy relativism that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.299" end="00:29:51.159" style="s2">taking hold in people&#39;s minds right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.009" end="00:29:53.499" style="s2">that men on average are actually more</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.159" end="00:29:54.369" style="s2">likely to engage in violent crime than</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.499" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">women are</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.369" end="00:30:02.710" style="s2">yeah that said I think there is a there</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:05.859" style="s2">is a pattern of thought that dogs us in</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.710" end="00:30:08.049" style="s2">this realm consistently and it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.859" end="00:30:09.429" style="s2">with the fact that there is something to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.049" end="00:30:11.019" style="s2">be said there&#39;s something to be borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.429" end="00:30:13.359" style="s2">from the analogy of the differences</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.019" end="00:30:16.330" style="s2">between males and females that can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.359" end="00:30:17.980" style="s2">imported into the racial realm right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.330" end="00:30:20.950" style="s2">that there&#39;s something to be borrowed</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.980" end="00:30:23.830" style="s2">from morphology to be understood about</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.950" end="00:30:25.419" style="s2">psychology and my concern is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.830" end="00:30:27.909" style="s2">they&#39;re actually very important</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.419" end="00:30:29.980" style="s2">biological reasons that these examples</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.909" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">are quite limited in their utility and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.980" end="00:30:34.659" style="s2">that the comparison between the two</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:36.549" style="s2">types of examples I mean in both cases</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.659" end="00:30:38.109" style="s2">that there are some things in which you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.549" end="00:30:40.059" style="s2">can say well let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.109" end="00:30:42.039" style="s2">difference between the sexes and see</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.059" end="00:30:42.770" style="s2">what it says about biases and policing</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.039" end="00:30:44.840" style="s2">and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.770" end="00:30:47.090" style="s2">misunderstanding what&#39;s going on because</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.840" end="00:30:50.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a bias in confrontations between</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.090" end="00:30:53.960" style="s2">males and police more so than females</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.350" end="00:30:56.299" style="s2">but the problem is I hear a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.960" end="00:30:58.010" style="s2">people who are at an intermediate level</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.299" end="00:31:00.200" style="s2">of sophistication in this argument and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.010" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of senses look we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.200" end="00:31:08.990" style="s2">watched the NBA right nobody thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:10.580" style="s2">the NBA is somehow misunderstanding that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.990" end="00:31:13.779" style="s2">there are a lot of white players who</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.580" end="00:31:16.340" style="s2">could be competing on this field</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.779" end="00:31:18.350" style="s2">therefore why don&#39;t we think that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.340" end="00:31:19.880" style="s2">know the cognitive realm is like sports</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.350" end="00:31:21.169" style="s2">where different populations have</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.880" end="00:31:22.490" style="s2">different strengths and that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.169" end="00:31:24.679" style="s2">way it is and there&#39;s a very good reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.490" end="00:31:27.350" style="s2">to think that it&#39;s not that way and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.679" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">don&#39;t see people understanding that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.350" end="00:31:32.809" style="s2">physical realm is actually abiding by</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:34.429" style="s2">very different rules and what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.809" end="00:31:36.649" style="s2">a discussion in which we get to that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.429" end="00:31:38.510" style="s2">we acknowledge why it is that different</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.649" end="00:31:40.460" style="s2">sports play to different populations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.510" end="00:31:42.770" style="s2">we understand what that does and does</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.460" end="00:31:44.870" style="s2">not say about the cognitive realm that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.770" end="00:31:48.470" style="s2">think is sort of the the conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.870" end="00:31:50.539" style="s2">need to work towards so you know one</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.470" end="00:31:52.760" style="s2">easy rejoinder I would think to what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.539" end="00:31:54.169" style="s2">just said is but aren&#39;t the environments</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.760" end="00:31:57.350" style="s2">in which different populations exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.169" end="00:32:00.049" style="s2">different and you can imagine arguing</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.350" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">well aren&#39;t the Inuit more like you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.049" end="00:32:05.539" style="s2">less likely to be good at gardening then</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:07.490" style="s2">through then the Cuong and the Kong less</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.539" end="00:32:10.010" style="s2">likely to be good at seal hunting than</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.490" end="00:32:11.630" style="s2">the Inuit yeah however so that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.010" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">particular skills based on very</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.630" end="00:32:16.220" style="s2">different different environments but</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:17.690" style="s2">what what you didn&#39;t say but what I know</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.220" end="00:32:20.870" style="s2">you were thinking because we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.690" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">talking about this for decades is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.870" end="00:32:23.419" style="s2">in both environments the environment of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:24.770" style="s2">the Inuit and the environment the koi</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.419" end="00:32:26.929" style="s2">environment of every single human being</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.770" end="00:32:28.510" style="s2">has ever lived with the possible weird</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.929" end="00:32:33.020" style="s2">exception of this moment right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.510" end="00:32:35.149" style="s2">effectively problem-solving logical</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.020" end="00:32:36.860" style="s2">ability to pose alternative ID</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.149" end="00:32:39.710" style="s2">explanations for what you observe and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.860" end="00:32:41.870" style="s2">distinguish between them creativity have</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.710" end="00:32:44.450" style="s2">all been absolutely necessary if</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.870" end="00:32:46.549" style="s2">populations are to survive and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.450" end="00:32:48.289" style="s2">that everyone in a population has those</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.549" end="00:32:50.450" style="s2">skills equally of course they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.289" end="00:32:52.669" style="s2">never will but every population that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.450" end="00:32:55.370" style="s2">survived to the current day will have</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.669" end="00:32:58.900" style="s2">had an abundance in some form or another</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.370" end="00:33:01.040" style="s2">of logic and analysis and creativity</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.900" end="00:33:03.110" style="s2">yeah but I think we can go even further</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.040" end="00:33:05.990" style="s2">this has to do with how these things are</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.110" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">inherited and so and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.990" end="00:33:12.410" style="s2">also a historical or a paleo historical</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:15.260" style="s2">discussion to be had which we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.410" end="00:33:17.150" style="s2">going to have now but let&#39;s just say the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.260" end="00:33:19.309" style="s2">intermediate level of sophistication on</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.150" end="00:33:21.680" style="s2">these points is very dangerous and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.309" end="00:33:23.240" style="s2">not rep you need to go past the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.680" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">intermediate level where you start</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.240" end="00:33:28.340" style="s2">projecting what you know to be true</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:31.400" style="s2">coming across your screen about the NBA</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.340" end="00:33:34.400" style="s2">and the NFL and you know Wimbledon or</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.400" end="00:33:36.770" style="s2">whatever and you start projecting that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.400" end="00:33:39.590" style="s2">into this other realm where you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.770" end="00:33:42.950" style="s2">whole different type of inheritance and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.590" end="00:33:47.000" style="s2">evolution and so anyway for a future</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.950" end="00:33:48.470" style="s2">date good my fiance and I plan to read</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.000" end="00:33:50.150" style="s2">white fragility to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.470" end="00:33:52.309" style="s2">people unaware if it&#39;s flawed view may</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.150" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">learn after reading themselves any</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.309" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">advice regarding a specific method of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:58.850" style="s2">approach you read with other work week</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">before or after etc the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.850" end="00:34:03.950" style="s2">comes to mind is that that you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">what James Lindsey has done on on this</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.950" end="00:34:08.780" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out yet but Helen</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:11.570" style="s2">pluck rose and his book which will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.780" end="00:34:13.429" style="s2">out soon I believe which I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.570" end="00:34:16.280" style="s2">called critical theories something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.429" end="00:34:17.720" style="s2">that I have not seen it but I know them</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.280" end="00:34:20.690" style="s2">both pretty well at this point and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.720" end="00:34:23.600" style="s2">know that their thinking is careful and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.690" end="00:34:24.860" style="s2">detailed on this subject yeah anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.600" end="00:34:27.139" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna suggest a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.860" end="00:34:29.090" style="s2">method okay okay yeah your answer is</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.139" end="00:34:31.429" style="s2">never gonna be about reading is it no it</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.090" end="00:34:34.010" style="s2">is okay yeah it&#39;s gonna be about reading</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.429" end="00:34:36.950" style="s2">yeah I think you should read it before</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.010" end="00:34:39.800" style="s2">you read I&#39;m Lindsey and pluck rose and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.950" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">then I think you should figure I should</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.800" end="00:34:46.040" style="s2">figure out what you spot about D&#39;Angelo</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.929" style="s2">and then see how it mirrors what they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.040" end="00:34:51.020" style="s2">come up with because they&#39;re who were to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.929" end="00:34:52.639" style="s2">be very deep into this analysis and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:55.250" style="s2">trust both of them to do it very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.639" end="00:34:57.170" style="s2">and to see all kinds of things and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.250" end="00:34:58.940" style="s2">anyway greatest training exercise you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.170" end="00:35:01.550" style="s2">could have is figure I mean frankly</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.940" end="00:35:03.740" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll find something I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:06.710" style="s2">sure there is some white fragility but I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.740" end="00:35:08.410" style="s2">think D&#39;Angelo is a dishonest actor</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.710" end="00:35:11.349" style="s2">who&#39;s using this as a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.410" end="00:35:13.869" style="s2">so you know are there people protecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.349" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">their privilege by pretending this that</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.869" end="00:35:18.760" style="s2">or the other way of course but um</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:21.430" style="s2">does that mean that anytime you hear</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.760" end="00:35:23.109" style="s2">somebody with light skin objecting to an</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.430" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">accusation you&#39;re hurling at them that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.109" end="00:35:27.069" style="s2">they are actually demonstrating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:28.809" style="s2">accusation itself of course not so so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.069" end="00:35:32.319" style="s2">this is critical though I mean what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.809" end="00:35:33.400" style="s2">said is read it on its own first and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.319" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">come to your own conclusions and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.400" end="00:35:36.160" style="s2">actually make sure even before you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:38.589" style="s2">discuss it with your fiance like</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.160" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">consider writing down what you think you</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.589" end="00:35:43.210" style="s2">know in advance of discussing it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:45.039" style="s2">advance of receiving any other wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.210" end="00:35:46.780" style="s2">from any other people no matter how good</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.039" end="00:35:48.549" style="s2">you think their thinking is yeah and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.780" end="00:35:51.160" style="s2">fact this is a tremendous level up</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.549" end="00:35:54.490" style="s2">opportunity because let&#39;s call this to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.160" end="00:35:57.309" style="s2">Candace Owens effect okay Candace sorts</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.490" end="00:36:02.650" style="s2">of people did yeah Candace Owens is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.309" end="00:36:06.309" style="s2">my opinion a cynical person who is</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.650" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">advancing her own cause at expense to</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.309" end="00:36:10.809" style="s2">the world however she&#39;s very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.410" end="00:36:12.670" style="s2">right okay I don&#39;t trust why she says</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.809" end="00:36:14.020" style="s2">what she says because I think I can show</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.670" end="00:36:15.190" style="s2">you the formula that will generate</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.020" end="00:36:17.289" style="s2">exactly what she&#39;s gonna think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.190" end="00:36:18.579" style="s2">anything and I don&#39;t you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.289" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">know an honest broker for whom that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.579" end="00:36:21.819" style="s2">true right an honest broker will have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:23.859" style="s2">some surprising opinions they&#39;ll arrive</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.819" end="00:36:24.630" style="s2">just some conclude conclusions you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.859" end="00:36:27.490" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.630" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">Candace never does so that suggests to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.490" end="00:36:32.049" style="s2">me that Candace isn&#39;t for real but if</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.059" style="s2">you think well Candace isn&#39;t for real</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.049" end="00:36:35.529" style="s2">therefore what she says is wrong you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.059" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">be wrong more than half the time she has</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.529" end="00:36:38.920" style="s2">a lot of very awkward things to say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">actually turn out to be true</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.920" end="00:36:44.829" style="s2">she just has tapped into that script</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:46.180" style="s2">yeah she&#39;s on script so anyway you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.829" end="00:36:47.950" style="s2">to be able to recognize the Candace&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.180" end="00:36:50.380" style="s2">right when she&#39;s right even if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.950" end="00:36:52.869" style="s2">like why she&#39;s saying it and the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.380" end="00:36:54.609" style="s2">presumably is true for D&#39;Angelo or</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.869" end="00:36:56.319" style="s2">anybody else I mean D&#39;Angelo is bound to</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.609" end="00:37:02.470" style="s2">be somewhat smart look how well she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.319" end="00:37:03.400" style="s2">doing yeah oh dear okay we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.470" end="00:37:06.339" style="s2">to get through a few more of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.400" end="00:37:08.049" style="s2">before switching Zack Father&#39;s Day is</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.339" end="00:37:10.690" style="s2">coming up have you considered buying</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.510" end="00:37:17.579" style="s2">calm I feel like a bolo tie would be</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.579" end="00:37:26.170" style="s2">alright I agree its ability to</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.840" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">we&#39;ll take it under consideration</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.370" end="00:37:42.050" style="s2">if a narco communists truly seek to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:43.660" style="s2">dismantle hierarchies then how do they</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.080" end="00:37:56.660" style="s2">numbskull so you really believe this</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.160" end="00:37:59.720" style="s2">stuff and then you&#39;ve got some people</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.660" end="00:38:02.840" style="s2">who cynically use it to advance their</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.720" end="00:38:05.000" style="s2">own cause and very hard to tell them</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.840" end="00:38:08.300" style="s2">apart I think the nice thing is we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.000" end="00:38:09.950" style="s2">really have to the plan is so bad and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.300" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">dangerous tat the point is well anybody</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.950" end="00:38:13.910" style="s2">who&#39;s espousing that just simply needs</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">to be kept away from the levers of power</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.910" end="00:38:17.030" style="s2">you cannot allow these people near the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">levers of power they&#39;re too dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.030" end="00:38:23.810" style="s2">right so anyway yeah they&#39;re both it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:25.520" style="s2">both true I&#39;ve met some real real</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.810" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">dyed-in-the-wool anarchists who actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.520" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">believe the stuff and then I&#39;ve met a</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.900" style="s2">lot of people who are using it as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:34.520" style="s2">excuse and that&#39;s that&#39;s probably fought</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.900" end="00:38:36.530" style="s2">her for a dissertation somewhere but at</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.520" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">the moment we just have to keep him away</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.530" end="00:38:40.550" style="s2">from stuff that matters yep critical</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:42.200" style="s2">theory has invaded the partner dance</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.550" end="00:38:44.180" style="s2">world including evergreen students</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.200" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">intriguing I don&#39;t know who this is but</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.180" end="00:38:49.310" style="s2">if you know evergreen students I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:50.870" style="s2">many questions but most pressing is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.310" end="00:38:52.430" style="s2">arguments can we formulate to try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.870" end="00:38:56.210" style="s2">reach people whose beliefs reject</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.430" end="00:38:58.520" style="s2">objective reality hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.210" end="00:39:03.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.520" end="00:39:05.450" style="s2">be a boilerplate answer that works and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.080" end="00:39:06.830" style="s2">to for some people that won&#39;t work I</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.450" end="00:39:10.190" style="s2">mean we were having this we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.830" end="00:39:12.500" style="s2">continued our disagreement from the end</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.190" end="00:39:15.619" style="s2">of the last Q&amp;A at dinner that night I</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.500" end="00:39:18.859" style="s2">believe in which I was I was pressing</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.619" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">you for you know there are reachable</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.859" end="00:39:23.060" style="s2">people you know there are reachable</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:25.130" style="s2">people who are not yet reached how is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.060" end="00:39:28.430" style="s2">that we can you know what can we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.130" end="00:39:30.410" style="s2">right yep so this is this is I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.430" end="00:39:31.960" style="s2">you bring that up in response to this</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.410" end="00:39:35.089" style="s2">question because I do think it actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.960" end="00:39:37.550" style="s2">requires some follow-up so I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.089" end="00:39:39.950" style="s2">a lot about why it was that I sound</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.550" end="00:39:41.750" style="s2">different with respect to this problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.950" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">than I did with respect to students</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.750" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">where I saw almost nobody is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.720" end="00:39:49.580" style="s2">unrecoverable and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:52.460" style="s2">simple I think we&#39;re in a much more dire</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.580" end="00:39:53.990" style="s2">circumstance and that it effectively you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.460" end="00:39:57.470" style="s2">know it&#39;s like the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.990" end="00:39:59.300" style="s2">doctor who thinks you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.470" end="00:40:01.940" style="s2">chance I can save that person and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.300" end="00:40:03.740" style="s2">doctor in wartime where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.940" end="00:40:05.990" style="s2">question of like look this is a matter</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.740" end="00:40:07.550" style="s2">of triage I might be able to save that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.990" end="00:40:09.290" style="s2">person on a good day but I can&#39;t save</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.550" end="00:40:11.180" style="s2">them now because it will cost three</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.290" end="00:40:16.550" style="s2">other people&#39;s lives to do it right and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.180" end="00:40:19.910" style="s2">so I think when it comes to figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.550" end="00:40:21.830" style="s2">how to talk to people who are beginning</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:24.619" style="s2">to sound this way you have to ask</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.830" end="00:40:27.320" style="s2">yourself a question which is is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.619" end="00:40:29.119" style="s2">person actually rescue Abul right is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.320" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">that person actually rescue ballif I</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">look at all of the people that I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:35.089" style="s2">like to pry away from this mode of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:37.010" style="s2">thinking before it&#39;s too late how many</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.089" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">of them can I actually reach and who is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.010" end="00:40:44.270" style="s2">the best shot and I just think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:45.380" style="s2">dire then then we necessarily imagine</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.270" end="00:40:47.060" style="s2">some of the arguments are so</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.380" end="00:40:48.619" style="s2">preposterous that it seems all very</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.060" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">cartoonish but this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.619" end="00:40:53.420" style="s2">live-fire exercise and I would also if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:57.290" style="s2">just say one more thing I said something</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.420" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">about forming the first against the wall</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.290" end="00:41:03.290" style="s2">club yeah and I actually believe this</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:04.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not that I want to be first against</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.290" end="00:41:06.619" style="s2">the wall but I do think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.730" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">something to the recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.619" end="00:41:10.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no place in the middle to stand</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.720" end="00:41:12.970" style="s2">right if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.120" end="00:41:15.160" style="s2">hedge if you try to stand in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.970" end="00:41:17.470" style="s2">and you try to hold on to what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.160" end="00:41:18.970" style="s2">actually believe but signal just enough</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.470" end="00:41:22.300" style="s2">to the other side that you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.970" end="00:41:25.300" style="s2">sympathetic to them it&#39;s gonna come for</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.300" end="00:41:28.710" style="s2">you and so my basic point is look I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.300" end="00:41:32.470" style="s2">aware that what I am saying will cause</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.710" end="00:41:34.090" style="s2">the mob to see me as the enemy and that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.470" end="00:41:35.410" style="s2">they will put me against the wall first</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.090" end="00:41:37.810" style="s2">that will be their choice that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.410" end="00:41:39.670" style="s2">mean by it and I don&#39;t want it and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.810" end="00:41:40.120" style="s2">won&#39;t let it happen to the extent I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.670" end="00:41:43.450" style="s2">avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.120" end="00:41:45.460" style="s2">but I know from experience that trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.450" end="00:41:46.600" style="s2">not to be first against the wall means</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.460" end="00:41:48.610" style="s2">that you&#39;re not gonna have anywhere to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.600" end="00:41:50.350" style="s2">stand right you&#39;re not gonna curry favor</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.610" end="00:41:52.090" style="s2">with the mob that way and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.350" end="00:41:54.490" style="s2">gonna spare you in the end so you might</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.090" end="00:41:55.750" style="s2">as well make your peace with that fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.490" end="00:41:57.970" style="s2">actually they&#39;re gonna hate me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.750" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">nothing I can do about it so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.970" end="00:42:02.320" style="s2">this this again could be a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:06.460" style="s2">you know that we&#39;ve had for hours then</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.320" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">that we could have publicly but my my</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.460" end="00:42:10.360" style="s2">one piece of pushback against that which</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:12.550" style="s2">you know when you said first against the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.360" end="00:42:15.820" style="s2">wall club in the last live stream</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.550" end="00:42:18.720" style="s2">whenever I guess it was 22 and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.820" end="00:42:21.070" style="s2">I had this immediate sort of recoil I</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.720" end="00:42:23.980" style="s2">think and I and I shared this with you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.070" end="00:42:26.710" style="s2">later I think part of that was it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.980" end="00:42:29.680" style="s2">that I don&#39;t share your values and your</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.710" end="00:42:32.380" style="s2">vision but especially if it&#39;s you saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.680" end="00:42:34.930" style="s2">this part of my job as your partner in</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.380" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">life and the mother of your children is</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.930" end="00:42:38.290" style="s2">to make sure that we aren&#39;t both first</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">against the wall yeah and so there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.290" end="00:42:42.910" style="s2">actually different different strategies</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:45.160" style="s2">that you need to use and that you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.910" end="00:42:48.820" style="s2">likely to use actually based on what sex</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.160" end="00:42:50.920" style="s2">you are in part if you see your partner</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.820" end="00:42:53.020" style="s2">doing something that is honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.920" end="00:42:55.300" style="s2">you know that if you were to follow suit</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.020" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">you would create a much greater tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.300" end="00:42:57.790" style="s2">within your own family you know we</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:01.450" style="s2">aren&#39;t talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.790" end="00:43:04.630" style="s2">I hope about actually being against a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.450" end="00:43:06.490" style="s2">wall but but I mean I remember this when</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.630" end="00:43:08.020" style="s2">we were in occupy that you were very</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.490" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">active and I was somewhat active and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.020" end="00:43:12.130" style="s2">there was a moment when we were up there</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:14.080" style="s2">on the Capitol campus and we had our</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.130" end="00:43:16.980" style="s2">kids with us and the police showed up</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.080" end="00:43:21.480" style="s2">and I put them behind me and I left</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.980" end="00:43:23.470" style="s2">because it was very important that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.480" end="00:43:25.840" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.470" end="00:43:28.180" style="s2">not be part of something and leave them</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.840" end="00:43:31.660" style="s2">with both of their parents somehow</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.180" end="00:43:38.650" style="s2">involved in in something that left both</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.660" end="00:43:40.780" style="s2">of us unavailable to them yep for kovat</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.650" end="00:43:42.730" style="s2">19 to become more adapted to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.780" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">outdoors to UV to the vitamin D</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.730" end="00:43:45.820" style="s2">environment would it likely give up</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:46.750" style="s2">quality in other areas of its skill set</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.820" end="00:43:48.550" style="s2">how interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.750" end="00:43:50.650" style="s2">becoming more of a generalist than its</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.550" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">current form so if so would this be</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.650" end="00:43:57.640" style="s2">desirable desirable for us or desirable</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:44:00.520" style="s2">for it boy we just don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.640" end="00:44:03.310" style="s2">about what it is and what it can do to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.520" end="00:44:05.170" style="s2">know but it&#39;s certainly possible there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.310" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">that there are trade-offs it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.170" end="00:44:09.820" style="s2">inherent that I mean well did their</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:11.980" style="s2">particular trade-offs here that it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.820" end="00:44:13.930" style="s2">already slid so far over they would have</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.980" end="00:44:17.470" style="s2">to give up some of its capacity so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.930" end="00:44:19.720" style="s2">problem is you will for reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.470" end="00:44:21.369" style="s2">have everything to do with the way we</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.720" end="00:44:22.869" style="s2">discussed this thing the way we named it</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.369" end="00:44:26.830" style="s2">the way we diagram it you will think</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.869" end="00:44:29.859" style="s2">that kovat 19 and SARS co2 are a thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.830" end="00:44:33.730" style="s2">they&#39;re not a thing right there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.859" end="00:44:36.280" style="s2">innumerable things and the problem is if</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.730" end="00:44:38.140" style="s2">one part of that thing one strain</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.280" end="00:44:40.990" style="s2">figures out a trick that makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.140" end="00:44:44.020" style="s2">generalist it doesn&#39;t suddenly force the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.990" end="00:44:47.080" style="s2">rest of them to pay the same price so</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.020" end="00:44:50.140" style="s2">there&#39;s no value here in it moving in</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.080" end="00:44:52.440" style="s2">one direction or another because unless</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.140" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">you shut down the part that didn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.440" end="00:44:58.180" style="s2">now you&#39;ve just got both phenomena so</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:45:02.470" style="s2">really this is why some of us are very</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.180" end="00:45:04.450" style="s2">adamant about aggressive measures to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.470" end="00:45:06.130" style="s2">limit the spread and frankly I think we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.450" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">hit the middle ground which isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.130" end="00:45:09.369" style="s2">valuable which is we weren&#39;t aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:11.380" style="s2">enough we were you know we were</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.369" end="00:45:13.060" style="s2">aggressive enough to really screw up the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.380" end="00:45:14.920" style="s2">economy without being aggressive enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.060" end="00:45:18.250" style="s2">to shut down the virus and I would point</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.920" end="00:45:19.480" style="s2">out New Zealand no more cases they seem</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.250" end="00:45:21.550" style="s2">to have done it they seem to have done</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.480" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">it now they they&#39;re an island there to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:26.830" style="s2">island to island yep that&#39;s an advantage</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:31.720" style="s2">um but I think we blew it and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.830" end="00:45:33.970" style="s2">lessons is early decisive action you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.720" end="00:45:36.190" style="s2">know we could have done it in a matter</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.970" end="00:45:37.300" style="s2">of weeks if we had been willing to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.190" end="00:45:38.460" style="s2">far enough and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.300" end="00:45:42.700" style="s2">that we may be stuck with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.460" end="00:45:44.740" style="s2">indefinitely yeah okay I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.700" end="00:45:46.330" style="s2">get least through these last so called</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:49.810" style="s2">orange questions there&#39;s just two more</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.330" end="00:45:51.490" style="s2">here before we skip switch to the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.810" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">ones Brett and Heather thank you both</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.490" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">for continuing to provide such wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:58.450" style="s2">content considers considering SpaceX&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.450" end="00:46:01.060" style="s2">do you think that careers in</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.410" end="00:46:03.370" style="s2">astrobiology will become increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.060" end="00:46:06.190" style="s2">valuable I don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.370" end="00:46:07.870" style="s2">there anytime soon well it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.190" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">the careers won&#39;t be valued if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.870" end="00:46:15.250" style="s2">interest in going to Mars even if Mars</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:17.620" style="s2">is not that happening a place the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.250" end="00:46:19.660" style="s2">that there&#39;s work on getting to Mars I</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.620" end="00:46:22.870" style="s2">think is cool it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.660" end="00:46:25.060" style="s2">stem job you can be excited about so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.870" end="00:46:27.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know um it&#39;s possible I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.060" end="00:46:30.370" style="s2">think Erik shutting down Mars are we</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.600" end="00:46:32.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question shut down Mars</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.370" end="00:46:34.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t think Mars would put up with it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.260" end="00:46:35.290" style="s2">probably not of all the planets I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.180" end="00:46:38.770" style="s2">it would be least likely to go along</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.290" end="00:46:40.750" style="s2">with that proposal but yeah but in any</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.770" end="00:46:43.510" style="s2">case I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.750" end="00:46:45.610" style="s2">hope we need to get past the next six</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.510" end="00:46:47.020" style="s2">months before we can really say anything</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.610" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">about how you should plan for the future</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.020" end="00:46:50.230" style="s2">because if the future has been canceled</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:52.540" style="s2">then you don&#39;t need to plan for it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.230" end="00:46:54.220" style="s2">okay next question which I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.540" end="00:46:55.450" style="s2">read and say I absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.220" end="00:46:57.610" style="s2">hundred-percent want to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.450" end="00:47:01.270" style="s2">this and in fact it&#39;s one it&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.610" end="00:47:02.440" style="s2">in enlarge that you and I and we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.270" end="00:47:06.100" style="s2">have talked about actually writing a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.440" end="00:47:07.840" style="s2">whole book on the question being Tom</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.100" end="00:47:10.180" style="s2">finishes by saying thanks for a career</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.840" end="00:47:11.560" style="s2">trajectory and much more can you</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.180" end="00:47:13.380" style="s2">elaborate on reinventing the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.560" end="00:47:15.190" style="s2">suggests observational techniques</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.380" end="00:47:16.780" style="s2">environments which yield phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.190" end="00:47:18.760" style="s2">influenced by evolution sources for</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.780" end="00:47:21.310" style="s2">hypothesis falsification etc I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.760" end="00:47:24.370" style="s2">is thank you for the question the this</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.310" end="00:47:27.370" style="s2">these things are exactly what how we</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.370" end="00:47:32.200" style="s2">taught and why we both ended up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.370" end="00:47:34.090" style="s2">so fond of education and had education</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.200" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">so central to what we did for so many</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.090" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">years despite the fact that neither of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:40.450" style="s2">us imagined that that would be what we</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:42.340" style="s2">did but everything you say here</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.450" end="00:47:45.640" style="s2">reinventing the wheel observational</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.340" end="00:47:46.870" style="s2">techniques environments which yield</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.640" end="00:47:49.660" style="s2">phenomena influenced by evolution</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.870" end="00:47:51.490" style="s2">sources for hypotheses falsification we</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.660" end="00:47:53.020" style="s2">came at it from so many different angles</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.490" end="00:47:55.330" style="s2">you know we did physical computing and a</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.020" end="00:47:57.400" style="s2">program on the evolution of humans we do</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.330" end="00:47:59.860" style="s2">you know we just did a tremendous number</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.400" end="00:48:01.120" style="s2">of things and I want to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.860" end="00:48:03.730" style="s2">this and probably make it at least a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.120" end="00:48:06.820" style="s2">full episode but probably more yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.730" end="00:48:09.130" style="s2">would say more important than sources</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.820" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">realms all of that is just a habit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.130" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">mind and the habit of mind of in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:20.500" style="s2">teaching life we we labeled it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:21.910" style="s2">look it up and the point was we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.500" end="00:48:24.670" style="s2">this instinct we have such we have</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.910" end="00:48:26.350" style="s2">access to such an amazing repository of</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.670" end="00:48:27.880" style="s2">information in Wikipedia and elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.350" end="00:48:29.980" style="s2">where all sorts of things that you want</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.880" end="00:48:33.100" style="s2">to know about you can just look them up</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.980" end="00:48:34.840" style="s2">and we get so used to the little burst</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.100" end="00:48:36.220" style="s2">of dopamine that we get for suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.840" end="00:48:37.630" style="s2">being knowledgeable about something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.220" end="00:48:39.640" style="s2">a minute ago we wanted to know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.630" end="00:48:42.490" style="s2">answer to that we don&#39;t realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.640" end="00:48:45.640" style="s2">great reward comes from doing the work</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.490" end="00:48:48.490" style="s2">before you look it up and then you look</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.640" end="00:48:51.580" style="s2">it up right so we used to have run a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.490" end="00:48:53.380" style="s2">field trip into Eastern Washington into</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.580" end="00:48:56.530" style="s2">a place called the scablands that has an</p>

<p begin="00:49:03.790" end="00:49:07.330" style="s2">told our students we&#39;re gonna take you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.110" end="00:49:08.500" style="s2">there don&#39;t look it up and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.330" end="00:49:10.120" style="s2">gonna show you the evidence and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.500" end="00:49:13.510" style="s2">gonna see if you can piece together what</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.120" end="00:49:16.090" style="s2">happened here and man is it a great</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.510" end="00:49:18.070" style="s2">exercise so amazing and we actually we</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.090" end="00:49:20.080" style="s2">we give a talk about this at Colorado</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.070" end="00:49:21.970" style="s2">College number of years back and wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.080" end="00:49:24.340" style="s2">short essay which is available actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.970" end="00:49:27.700" style="s2">so we&#39;ll link it maybe here it&#39;s I think</p>

<p begin="00:49:27.700" end="00:49:31.120" style="s2">it up don&#39;t look it up I would also if I</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:34.810" style="s2">can just throw one more thing in here we</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.120" end="00:49:36.670" style="s2">were in Ecuador we had an assignment for</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.810" end="00:49:38.620" style="s2">students there&#39;s a pattern of leaf</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.140" end="00:49:55.570" style="s2">we set students about the question of</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:28.500" style="s2">in Seattle what would the argument be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.610" end="00:50:30.530" style="s2">what would be necessary for a lasting</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.500" end="00:50:33.660" style="s2">beneficial movement for the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.530" end="00:50:35.370" style="s2">good question well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.660" end="00:50:37.530" style="s2">understand that steel Manning actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.370" end="00:50:39.210" style="s2">has an assumption built into it which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.530" end="00:50:41.190" style="s2">that the people that you are steel</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.210" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">Manning are actually of good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.190" end="00:50:44.520" style="s2">while I do think that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.330" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">people involved in Chad&#39;s who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.520" end="00:50:49.590" style="s2">probably earnestly of the belief that</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:52.320" style="s2">anarchy will result in something</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.590" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">glorious many of the people involved are</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.320" end="00:50:55.770" style="s2">not and so you can&#39;t really steal man</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:59.940" style="s2">Chazz you could steal man an</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.770" end="00:51:01.050" style="s2">individual&#39;s perspective on it and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.940" end="00:51:03.410" style="s2">would say it&#39;s you know it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.050" end="00:51:06.660" style="s2">straightforward the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.410" end="00:51:09.030" style="s2">centralized Authority is bad and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.660" end="00:51:11.490" style="s2">there by tearing it down will allow the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.030" end="00:51:14.130" style="s2">organic emergence of something better on</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.490" end="00:51:16.590" style="s2">the other hand guess what the United</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.130" end="00:51:17.550" style="s2">States is the organic emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.590" end="00:51:20.400" style="s2">something better</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.550" end="00:51:24.330" style="s2">it is centralized to an extent necessary</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.400" end="00:51:28.050" style="s2">but it is also based on the consent of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.330" end="00:51:29.970" style="s2">the governed so the question is what are</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.050" end="00:51:31.890" style="s2">you gonna replace with what now all</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.970" end="00:51:34.200" style="s2">right I mean we have a system it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.890" end="00:51:36.630" style="s2">deeply flawed but it&#39;s not unrecoverable</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.200" end="00:51:38.580" style="s2">and nobody seems to have understood that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.630" end="00:51:40.830" style="s2">if you tear it down you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.580" end="00:51:42.870" style="s2">warlordism replacing it you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.830" end="00:51:45.750" style="s2">to get some improved version of</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.870" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">civilization or if you did it would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.750" end="00:51:53.130" style="s2">unnecessary to go through the you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:55.260" style="s2">the bloodshed in in between so what do</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.130" end="00:51:58.860" style="s2">you have to so anyway it&#39;s hard to steal</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.260" end="00:52:02.250" style="s2">man the whole thing but individuals may</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.860" end="00:52:04.260" style="s2">be of a utopian perspective in which</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.250" end="00:52:07.369" style="s2">case they need to be able to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.260" end="00:52:09.570" style="s2">world around them with clearer eyes</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.369" end="00:52:11.340" style="s2">do you differentiate between organic</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.570" end="00:52:12.990" style="s2">struggle sessions as in the u.s. right</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.340" end="00:52:15.390" style="s2">now and state instituted struggle</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.990" end="00:52:18.600" style="s2">sessions as with maoism or are both</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.390" end="00:52:20.100" style="s2">leading to the same outcome these these</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.600" end="00:52:22.680" style="s2">do look like struggle sessions these do</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.100" end="00:52:26.190" style="s2">look so Maoist yeah this this moment</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.680" end="00:52:28.500" style="s2">looks evermore you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.190" end="00:52:30.780" style="s2">not students exactly so it&#39;s not red</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.500" end="00:52:33.300" style="s2">guard exactly but it looks very much</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.780" end="00:52:35.640" style="s2">like what was going on in China in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.300" end="00:52:37.290" style="s2">late sixties to the late 70s yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.640" end="00:52:39.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason to distinguish but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.290" end="00:52:47.130" style="s2">think the point is okay well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.090" end="00:52:51.480" style="s2">interesting there&#39;s a twist yeah echo</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.130" end="00:52:52.590" style="s2">asks performative solution proposal to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.480" end="00:52:54.810" style="s2">current dead end</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.590" end="00:52:56.700" style="s2">giant fake extraterrestrial invasion</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.810" end="00:52:58.560" style="s2">with real things to shoot at in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.700" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">it will create sense of common interest</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.560" end="00:53:02.460" style="s2">and growth give tokens when alien ships</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:05.970" style="s2">down better than above-ground nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.460" end="00:53:07.560" style="s2">testing yes yes better yes for sure</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.970" end="00:53:10.859" style="s2">better than above-ground nuclear testing</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.560" end="00:53:13.230" style="s2">and yeah having an actual common enemy</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.859" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">yeah would unite us until the common</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.230" end="00:53:17.010" style="s2">enemy was gone again all right point</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:18.900" style="s2">we&#39;re back you know just just like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.010" end="00:53:20.490" style="s2">pandemic shut down a bunch of this</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.900" end="00:53:23.550" style="s2">critical theory nonsense for a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.490" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">while it was down at a low simmer until</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.550" end="00:53:26.640" style="s2">people were fed up and it wasn&#39;t clear</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:30.960" style="s2">that the lockdowns were doing what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.640" end="00:53:33.030" style="s2">had to do etc etc so the problem is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.960" end="00:53:34.920" style="s2">so hard to fake an alien invasion that</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.030" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">at some level is just simpler to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.920" end="00:53:42.119" style="s2">real aliens sure I mean do a cataloger</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">I mean if they&#39;re monitoring us surely</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.119" end="00:53:46.890" style="s2">we can just you know send up a flare</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:48.810" style="s2">yeah okay Brett I saw your interview on</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.890" end="00:53:50.280" style="s2">the origins of game beam a movement that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.810" end="00:53:51.869" style="s2">is now growing are you planning on</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.280" end="00:53:52.560" style="s2">staying involved in it or in similar</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.869" end="00:53:55.320" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.560" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s stuff um bubbling that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.320" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">looking positive so anyway we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:02.190" style="s2">where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:04.290" style="s2">but the renewed interesting game be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.190" end="00:54:05.520" style="s2">not a moment too soon and as a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.290" end="00:54:08.040" style="s2">fact I argued to them that we were many</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.520" end="00:54:09.600" style="s2">moments too late but until we know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.040" end="00:54:11.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible we might as well keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.600" end="00:54:14.100" style="s2">going in that direction you ordered that</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.580" end="00:54:15.900" style="s2">to them this week yeah yeah not years</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.100" end="00:54:18.180" style="s2">ago when the first meetings were</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.900" end="00:54:19.590" style="s2">happening no although I thought it I may</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.180" end="00:54:21.080" style="s2">have said them too yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.590" end="00:54:23.810" style="s2">we&#39;re 30 years too late at</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.080" end="00:54:26.060" style="s2">project but it&#39;s still possible but you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.810" end="00:54:28.730" style="s2">know things are moving fast so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.060" end="00:54:32.770" style="s2">getting too late it is getting more too</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.730" end="00:54:34.610" style="s2">late at a very rapid pace calculus</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.770" end="00:54:36.770" style="s2">building on what you said about young</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.610" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">adult books these days I mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.770" end="00:54:40.310" style="s2">in our last and 22 I believe</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:42.230" style="s2">let&#39;s petition to JK Rowling to write</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.310" end="00:54:43.640" style="s2">some thank you for the podcast love from</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.230" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">Poland yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.640" end="00:54:47.210" style="s2">she&#39;s great and you know she&#39;s got our</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:48.710" style="s2">hands full at the moment with Yahoo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.210" end="00:54:50.810" style="s2">you&#39;re coming for her</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.710" end="00:54:52.190" style="s2">but yeah she&#39;d be she&#39;d definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.810" end="00:54:54.910" style="s2">one of the ones who I&#39;d look at I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.190" end="00:54:57.700" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard from a few people also</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.910" end="00:54:59.660" style="s2">recommending books that aren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.700" end="00:55:01.640" style="s2">haven&#39;t quite been translated into</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.660" end="00:55:03.910" style="s2">English but are about to be suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.640" end="00:55:07.940" style="s2">that some of the non English why a</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.910" end="00:55:10.190" style="s2">literature maybe at least behind English</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.940" end="00:55:14.420" style="s2">in terms of its indoctrination with folk</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.190" end="00:55:18.290" style="s2">stuff so I would say about Rowling that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.420" end="00:55:20.780" style="s2">I think she is becoming anti fragile I</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.290" end="00:55:22.700" style="s2">think yes we&#39;ve paid the price but she</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.780" end="00:55:25.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t start out there right there was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.700" end="00:55:27.110" style="s2">long period of time where I really</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.610" end="00:55:30.020" style="s2">thought she was actually a threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.110" end="00:55:31.850" style="s2">value in the Harry Potter series because</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.020" end="00:55:34.550" style="s2">she kept saying all this crazy stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.850" end="00:55:38.990" style="s2">so anyway I think there&#39;s a model in</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.550" end="00:55:41.120" style="s2">there a the amount of money that one has</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.990" end="00:55:43.460" style="s2">to have in order to feel safe enough to</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.120" end="00:55:44.360" style="s2">just finally speak the truth is more</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.460" end="00:55:48.410" style="s2">than it should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.360" end="00:55:50.150" style="s2">Rowling you know is quite wealthy and</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.410" end="00:55:52.550" style="s2">powerful and she can afford to make</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.150" end="00:55:59.120" style="s2">enemies and anyway she&#39;s leading the way</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.550" end="00:56:00.740" style="s2">and the the game plan ought to be that</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.120" end="00:56:03.740" style="s2">those of us who for whatever reason are</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.740" end="00:56:07.430" style="s2">in a position to face the mob and stare</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.740" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">them down those people create safety for</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.430" end="00:56:10.790" style="s2">the people who are slightly less better</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:15.170" style="s2">positioned from them and if that can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.790" end="00:56:16.670" style="s2">made to SAS Cade there is hope yes we</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.170" end="00:56:18.710" style="s2">need more transparency in general</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.670" end="00:56:21.320" style="s2">algorithms and social media governments</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.710" end="00:56:24.550" style="s2">etc I also think Brett looks like such a</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.320" end="00:56:28.810" style="s2">huggable papa bear so if we ever meet</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.550" end="00:56:28.810" style="s2">you do love bears hmm</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.320" end="00:56:34.109" style="s2">would you ever consider creating an</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.430" end="00:56:38.589" style="s2">evolutionary biology lecture series</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.109" end="00:56:39.819" style="s2">maybe yep what do you think about moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.589" end="00:56:41.650" style="s2">towards a single-payer health care</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.819" end="00:56:43.299" style="s2">system we spend the most per capita on</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.369" end="00:56:56.950" style="s2">expert in this it looks like a far</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.520" end="00:56:59.260" style="s2">better system than what we&#39;ve got yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.950" end="00:57:00.849" style="s2">mean I I would like to improve on what</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.260" end="00:57:02.109" style="s2">the rest of the world has discovered but</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.849" end="00:57:04.809" style="s2">I do feel like we were paying an</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.109" end="00:57:07.660" style="s2">unnecessary price in order not to step</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.809" end="00:57:12.790" style="s2">on the financial toes of the extractive</p>

<p begin="00:57:18.430" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">accurate but the person who asked the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.890" end="00:57:24.970" style="s2">question says there&#39;s 80 million people</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:27.099" style="s2">who are under or uninsured and you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.970" end="00:57:29.109" style="s2">one of the things that has become</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.099" end="00:57:32.349" style="s2">completely apparent to us in the wake of</p>

<p begin="00:57:35.619" end="00:57:40.990" style="s2">fully know what all the situation is out</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.640" end="00:57:43.720" style="s2">there and so at the moment for instance</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.990" end="00:57:45.309" style="s2">we&#39;re not underinsured but we are paying</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.720" end="00:57:48.690" style="s2">an insane amount of money to be not</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.309" end="00:57:51.369" style="s2">underinsured so you know you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.690" end="00:57:53.650" style="s2">ignorant of this from being salaried and</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.650" end="00:57:58.329" style="s2">decay of the American healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.559" end="00:58:00.549" style="s2">you may not have any idea how bad it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.329" end="00:58:01.900" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a massive failure of empathy</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.549" end="00:58:03.460" style="s2">where the people who are most likely to</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.900" end="00:58:05.410" style="s2">have the power to fix the system are</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.460" end="00:58:07.540" style="s2">least likely to understand how dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.410" end="00:58:11.859" style="s2">the circumstance has become to average</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.540" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">people yeah have you looked at I&#39;ve no</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.859" end="00:58:18.040" style="s2">idea to pronounce this cirques icsea rx</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:19.299" style="s2">or other personal search engines I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.040" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">never heard of it</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.299" end="00:58:26.819" style="s2">so no but the idea sounds intriguing</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:26.819" style="s2">from what I could tell from the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.520" end="00:58:36.020" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s like something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.070" end="00:58:37.820" style="s2">that I do too so that if I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.020" end="00:58:39.080" style="s2">you guys can hear Zack but Zack just</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.820" end="00:58:40.940" style="s2">said I think you may be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.080" end="00:58:45.260" style="s2">DuckDuckGo I have DuckDuckGo set as my</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.940" end="00:58:48.740" style="s2">as my default but I don&#39;t I I think this</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.260" end="00:58:50.270" style="s2">is a little different maybe maybe aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.740" end="00:58:51.800" style="s2">we just seeing the nonsensical culture</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.270" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">disputes that accompany demographic</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.800" end="00:58:57.800" style="s2">change and transfer of power well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:59:01.070" style="s2">looking at a power grab and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.800" end="00:59:05.540" style="s2">is power is very badly distributed so</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.070" end="00:59:07.880" style="s2">the desire to see something else gain</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.540" end="00:59:09.590" style="s2">power is understandable in fact I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.880" end="00:59:11.150" style="s2">this is part of what put Trump in office</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.590" end="00:59:14.030" style="s2">was just that we were sick and tired of</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.150" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">the same corrupt forces ruling us you</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.030" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">know election after election so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:21.170" style="s2">this is another corrupt force but this</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:23.840" style="s2">corrupt force has co-opted the energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.170" end="00:59:25.910" style="s2">that might direct us to an improvement</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.840" end="00:59:28.330" style="s2">that is to say the amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.910" end="00:59:31.790" style="s2">being dedicated to a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.330" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">portrayal of what is wrong and totally</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.790" end="00:59:37.190" style="s2">nonsensical solutions that will only put</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">us in greater danger that energy could</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.190" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">also be directed at something that had</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">value and what a shame that it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:47.960" style="s2">good the next sort of seems like word</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:51.110" style="s2">salad to me space explore it mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.960" end="00:59:53.900" style="s2">Marvel&#39;s absolute Universal I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.110" end="00:59:55.670" style="s2">what that means I agree with it well</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.900" end="00:59:57.470" style="s2">widely available psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.670" end="00:59:58.460" style="s2">psychotherapy help humanity out of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.470" end="01:00:01.070" style="s2">current situations</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.460" end="01:00:03.140" style="s2">well that presumes that psychedelic</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.070" end="01:00:06.080" style="s2">assisted psychotherapy will become</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.140" end="01:00:07.340" style="s2">widely available but could a widely</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.080" end="01:00:09.650" style="s2">available psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.340" end="01:00:13.550" style="s2">psychotherapy help humanity out of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.650" end="01:00:15.230" style="s2">current situation I think it&#39;s good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.550" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the only thing we need and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.230" end="01:00:18.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not for everyone but I think it</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:22.430" style="s2">could here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.110" end="01:00:27.110" style="s2">the the truth isn&#39;t in the molecules</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.430" end="01:00:29.840" style="s2">sure right and so could could this kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.110" end="01:00:32.750" style="s2">of psychotherapy help people to see more</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.840" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">clearly of course but it has to come</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.750" end="01:00:37.190" style="s2">with the material that would allow an</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:39.050" style="s2">upgrade to your software so somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.190" end="01:00:41.240" style="s2">you have to get the insight that then</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.050" end="01:00:42.250" style="s2">gets incorporated into your mind and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.240" end="01:00:46.450" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.250" end="01:00:50.080" style="s2">what you see so in some sense I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.450" end="01:00:53.350" style="s2">trust the mechanism that would you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.080" end="01:00:54.970" style="s2">in a sea of noisy data I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.350" end="01:00:57.160" style="s2">an amplifier is going to be helpful</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.970" end="01:00:59.110" style="s2">right I&#39;m not sure something that breaks</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.160" end="01:01:00.700" style="s2">down boundaries and allows you to rewire</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.110" end="01:01:04.150" style="s2">around nonsense is going to be helpful</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.700" end="01:01:07.690" style="s2">so I&#39;m concerned that those molecules</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.150" end="01:01:09.730" style="s2">may be useful in a process but that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.690" end="01:01:10.660" style="s2">process has other prerequisites in order</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.730" end="01:01:14.610" style="s2">to be helpful and the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.660" end="01:01:14.610" style="s2">prerequisites look pretty rare to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.510" end="01:01:21.160" style="s2">Latin X in quotes opinions mhm yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.330" end="01:01:25.800" style="s2">may have noticed that the the Boston</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.160" end="01:01:28.660" style="s2">mayor&#39;s executive order used the term I</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.800" end="01:01:30.760" style="s2">think it used the term Latin X and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.660" end="01:01:34.150" style="s2">when I was speaking about Latino people</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.760" end="01:01:37.060" style="s2">afterwards I did not Latino being until</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.150" end="01:01:41.590" style="s2">yesterday both the male and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.060" end="01:01:44.770" style="s2">gender-neutral form of of the of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.590" end="01:01:47.650" style="s2">more polysyllabic group Latinos and</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.770" end="01:01:50.320" style="s2">Latinas I think it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.650" end="01:01:52.750" style="s2">and from what I&#39;ve from what I</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.320" end="01:01:55.900" style="s2">understand from some attempts to look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.750" end="01:01:58.650" style="s2">this carefully and from my own anecdotal</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.900" end="01:02:01.780" style="s2">experiences talking with actual Latinos</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.650" end="01:02:03.490" style="s2">most Latinos do too this is this is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.780" end="01:02:05.260" style="s2">this is not organically coming from a</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.490" end="01:02:06.700" style="s2">Latino community community yeah and to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.260" end="01:02:08.950" style="s2">the extent that it is in the Latino</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.700" end="01:02:11.080" style="s2">community it&#39;s not coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.950" end="01:02:14.650" style="s2">Latino community abroad now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.080" end="01:02:16.060" style="s2">beginning to work its way there but what</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.650" end="01:02:18.000" style="s2">I would say is first of all there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.060" end="01:02:21.550" style="s2">fundamental misunderstanding about what</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.000" end="01:02:23.740" style="s2">gendered language is right gendered</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.550" end="01:02:25.750" style="s2">language is part of an error correction</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.740" end="01:02:28.090" style="s2">program so that one knows what refers to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.750" end="01:02:30.520" style="s2">what dejenne during it creates an</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.090" end="01:02:35.010" style="s2">increase in the likelihood of error and</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.520" end="01:02:39.220" style="s2">so I would say you could argue that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.010" end="01:02:42.220" style="s2">terminology of male plugs and female</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.220" end="01:02:45.490" style="s2">plugs that we use to describe electronic</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.220" end="01:02:46.960" style="s2">components that that is oppressive it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.490" end="01:02:48.940" style="s2">not oppressive it is a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.960" end="01:02:51.220" style="s2">communicative anatomy it is descriptive</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.940" end="01:02:52.690" style="s2">of something and it allows the instant</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.220" end="01:02:55.170" style="s2">communication of something that would</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.690" end="01:02:57.029" style="s2">otherwise leave us fumbling for words</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.170" end="01:03:01.109" style="s2">which thing you were looking for so</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.029" end="01:03:03.150" style="s2">that&#39;s all true but you know to steal</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.109" end="01:03:05.670" style="s2">man Latin X I just I don&#39;t think it was</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.150" end="01:03:08.910" style="s2">a good faith move to begin with and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.670" end="01:03:12.239" style="s2">I&#39;ve not seen anyone whose intentions I</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.239" end="01:03:18.900" style="s2">to steal man the idea why is it that the</p>

<p begin="01:03:28.410" end="01:03:32.849" style="s2">know it would appear to disappear women</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.630" end="01:03:36.539" style="s2">more than it disappeared as men and you</p>

<p begin="01:03:39.720" end="01:03:47.160" style="s2">reasons I always was and continue to be</p>

<p begin="01:03:56.789" end="01:04:00.059" style="s2">know whether I&#39;m married because for</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.289" end="01:04:03.839" style="s2">almost almost any interaction it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.059" end="01:04:06.059" style="s2">relevant so you know Latino as the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.839" end="01:04:10.410" style="s2">gender-neutral term which also would</p>

<p begin="01:04:12.239" end="01:04:16.980" style="s2">really like the word but does have that</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.499" end="01:04:19.529" style="s2">history built into it that said I like</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.980" end="01:04:24.239" style="s2">the term Latino it works it is you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.529" end="01:04:26.849" style="s2">imposing linguistic change top-down can</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.239" end="01:04:29.009" style="s2">work as it did with MS but in this case</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.849" end="01:04:31.230" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s coercive and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.009" end="01:04:33.150" style="s2">wrongheaded alright so I hear what</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.230" end="01:04:34.829" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and I am a big fan of MS</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.150" end="01:04:37.079" style="s2">also but there&#39;s a very good reason that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.829" end="01:04:39.720" style="s2">you want to make that change which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.079" end="01:04:43.140" style="s2">that the value of women was understood</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.720" end="01:04:45.539" style="s2">to be reproductive woman&#39;s role changed</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.140" end="01:04:47.970" style="s2">positively in the sense that they were</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.539" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">integrated into the economy at almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.970" end="01:04:55.170" style="s2">every level and that therefore a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:58.369" style="s2">throwback to a time when women&#39;s value</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.170" end="01:05:00.900" style="s2">was in conjunction with a man was</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.369" end="01:05:02.460" style="s2">hazardous was harmful led to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.900" end="01:05:04.109" style="s2">impression in every interaction where</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.460" end="01:05:06.569" style="s2">those things were invoked that that was</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.109" end="01:05:08.490" style="s2">in fact what the person&#39;s primary role</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.569" end="01:05:10.710" style="s2">was in that interaction so</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.490" end="01:05:14.280" style="s2">that needed to be upgraded and in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.710" end="01:05:16.950" style="s2">case of the gender-neutral issue it</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.280" end="01:05:18.900" style="s2">seems to me you can wreck the language</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.950" end="01:05:20.970" style="s2">you can destroy the error correction</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.900" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">capacity or you can do what we do in</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.970" end="01:05:28.590" style="s2">English right we say guys all right now</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:33.180" style="s2">I also have been using the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.590" end="01:05:35.730" style="s2">gender-neutral term dude for as long as</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.180" end="01:05:37.140" style="s2">I can remember well you know this the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.730" end="01:05:39.630" style="s2">slider for all of us will be somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.140" end="01:05:41.070" style="s2">different you know I personally mankind</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.630" end="01:05:42.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sit right with me even though it</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.070" end="01:05:43.950" style="s2">sounds a lot better than humankind but I</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.630" end="01:05:46.350" style="s2">use humankind okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.950" end="01:05:48.510" style="s2">because for me mankind really does feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.350" end="01:05:50.970" style="s2">like it&#39;s very explicitly not like</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.510" end="01:05:52.470" style="s2">Latino but much more about referring to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.970" end="01:05:55.740" style="s2">an era in which the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.470" end="01:05:57.630" style="s2">studying humans were actually coming not</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.740" end="01:05:59.190" style="s2">just through a male lens themselves but</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.630" end="01:06:01.890" style="s2">actually applying that bias to how they</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.190" end="01:06:03.720" style="s2">understood the world whereas Latino</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.890" end="01:06:07.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any such history as I</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.720" end="01:06:09.540" style="s2">understand it right and so hey I agree</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.530" end="01:06:10.980" style="s2">with you I I don&#39;t know whether I say</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.540" end="01:06:13.670" style="s2">mankind I certainly wouldn&#39;t object to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.980" end="01:06:16.770" style="s2">saying mankind I tend to say humanity</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.670" end="01:06:20.790" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not conscious</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.770" end="01:06:24.660" style="s2">yeah but what I would say is the ability</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.790" end="01:06:26.490" style="s2">to broaden the term guys right so that</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.660" end="01:06:30.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a gendered component</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.490" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">yeah or dude is actually I mean I must</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.840" end="01:06:34.619" style="s2">tell you dude I now have a problem with</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:39.000" style="s2">it again even though for decades I did</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.619" end="01:06:42.300" style="s2">not why because if I run into a trans</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.000" end="01:06:44.550" style="s2">woman and I say dude what am I saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.300" end="01:06:45.960" style="s2">yeah so even though I said we got you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.550" end="01:06:48.330" style="s2">know if unless it&#39;s someone that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.960" end="01:06:50.850" style="s2">know who you know well even if this if</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.330" end="01:06:52.109" style="s2">this is if this is one of the very few</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.850" end="01:06:53.220" style="s2">interactions you will have with them and</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.109" end="01:06:55.410" style="s2">they you know they are not around you</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.220" end="01:06:57.840" style="s2">enough to see you call me dude right and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.410" end="01:06:59.210" style="s2">you know other women dude then you maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.840" end="01:07:01.890" style="s2">intentionally or unintentionally</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.210" end="01:07:03.840" style="s2">misgendering them right in fact you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.890" end="01:07:06.780" style="s2">using as a gender-neutral term which has</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.840" end="01:07:08.670" style="s2">its origin in gender right exactly it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.780" end="01:07:10.109" style="s2">it is a very confusing and incoherent</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.670" end="01:07:14.550" style="s2">moment but in general what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.109" end="01:07:17.019" style="s2">is the good intentions of the people you</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.550" end="01:07:19.719" style="s2">are talking to matter a great deal more</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.019" end="01:07:21.789" style="s2">then the little nuances of how we put</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.719" end="01:07:23.679" style="s2">the words together and disrupting our</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.789" end="01:07:25.630" style="s2">ability to communicate effectively in</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.679" end="01:07:28.929" style="s2">order to solve a problem that if it</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.630" end="01:07:30.159" style="s2">exists is minor is a mistake the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.929" end="01:07:31.419" style="s2">important thing is that we are able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.159" end="01:07:33.640" style="s2">talk to each other and know what is</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.419" end="01:07:36.369" style="s2">being said and to do so clearly and</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.640" end="01:07:39.069" style="s2">frankly if this is a problem that needs</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.369" end="01:07:41.649" style="s2">to be solved it needs to be put at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.069" end="01:07:43.899" style="s2">end of the list we have so many more</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.649" end="01:07:47.319" style="s2">dire problems than the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.899" end="01:07:49.779" style="s2">term Latino that it can afford to wait</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.319" end="01:07:51.459" style="s2">until civilization has been saved and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.779" end="01:07:55.719" style="s2">the Republic is once again secured and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.459" end="01:07:57.880" style="s2">all of these things yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.719" end="01:07:58.749" style="s2">well let me just quickly scroll through</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.880" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">and see if there&#39;s anything else that</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.749" end="01:08:04.359" style="s2">jumps out at me is something we 100%</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:05.829" style="s2">want to get to here there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.359" end="01:08:07.329" style="s2">about the Dark Knight trilogy which we</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.829" end="01:08:10.299" style="s2">just don&#39;t know enough about probably to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.329" end="01:08:13.479" style="s2">answer someone still thinks we still</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.299" end="01:08:15.789" style="s2">know what anarchism is if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.479" end="01:08:17.380" style="s2">riff on that while I just check there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.789" end="01:08:19.480" style="s2">anything else here all I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.380" end="01:08:21.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve spent so much time arguing with</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.480" end="01:08:25.059" style="s2">anarchists that if I don&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.670" end="01:08:27.250" style="s2">there&#39;s just something immeasurably</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.059" end="01:08:29.619" style="s2">wrong with me but my basic sense is look</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.250" end="01:08:32.559" style="s2">when I&#39;m in chaos I say chaos when I</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.619" end="01:08:34.359" style="s2">mean Anarchy I say I narky the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.559" end="01:08:36.219" style="s2">what I am saying and what I am calling</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.359" end="01:08:39.190" style="s2">Anarchy many of the people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.219" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">describing would also call Anarchy tells</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.190" end="01:08:43.299" style="s2">me that the problem isn&#39;t with me right</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:45.400" style="s2">if you think that there is a problem</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.299" end="01:08:46.630" style="s2">with what I&#39;m describing is Anarchy then</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.400" end="01:08:48.429" style="s2">you need to get the people who are also</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.630" end="01:08:51.639" style="s2">describing it as Anarchy who are part of</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.429" end="01:08:54.670" style="s2">it to stop describing it that way okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.639" end="01:08:56.519" style="s2">there are a number of good things here</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.670" end="01:08:59.500" style="s2">so I think we&#39;re just going to end on</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.519" end="01:09:02.289" style="s2">this comment I was when you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.500" end="01:09:04.449" style="s2">about anonymity being very recent I was</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.289" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">trying to think about that there must be</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.449" end="01:09:08.049" style="s2">examples from history in which anonymity</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:10.119" style="s2">was possible and so this person has said</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.049" end="01:09:12.219" style="s2">anonymity has not recent ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.119" end="01:09:15.219" style="s2">and Rome with the butcher the</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:20.859" style="s2">of anonymity as in the Federalist Papers</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.329" end="01:09:23.259" style="s2">now wait a second</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.859" end="01:09:25.869" style="s2">when I say recent I speak as an</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.620" end="01:09:41.259" style="s2">examples but my point is look some part</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.500" end="01:09:43.509" style="s2">of us was built in an ancestral past it</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.259" end="01:09:44.710" style="s2">goes way earlier than this that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.509" end="01:09:46.659" style="s2">there was no possibility of anonymity</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.710" end="01:09:47.650" style="s2">because the person was either there or</p>

<p begin="01:09:47.650" end="01:09:52.029" style="s2">right they were either having their</p>

<p begin="01:09:56.949" end="01:10:00.370" style="s2">writing is recent doesn&#39;t jibe well with</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.170" end="01:10:01.659" style="s2">what most people have learned because</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.370" end="01:10:03.790" style="s2">what most people have learned is so</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.659" end="01:10:07.420" style="s2">heavily biased into what we call history</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.790" end="01:10:08.889" style="s2">but history itself is that which took</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.420" end="01:10:11.500" style="s2">place after a written record was</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.889" end="01:10:13.510" style="s2">possible right so prehistory is much</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.500" end="01:10:14.860" style="s2">longer than history and it has a lot to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.510" end="01:10:17.560" style="s2">do with how we view the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.860" end="01:10:21.010" style="s2">so anyway forgive me for not being clear</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.560" end="01:10:23.830" style="s2">about that but yeah the Greeks pretty</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.010" end="01:10:24.040" style="s2">recent all right I think that&#39;s it all</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.830" end="01:10:26.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.040" end="01:10:29.230" style="s2">well this has been interesting I would</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.320" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">ask actually please would you tell us if</p>
