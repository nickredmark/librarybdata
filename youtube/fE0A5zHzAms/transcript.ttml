<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">hips and come forward and as i do</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">this turns my hands and see how this</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">hand is starting to turn</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">okay let&#39;s do the upper hand first we</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">get the lower hand the upper hand now</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:43.919" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.720" style="s2">come this way don&#39;t come on the diagonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.919" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">spiral in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.720" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll do this side on too i come in</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">and then down the center see how my palm</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">which is originally facing me is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">rotating the whole time i&#39;m doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">okay so don&#39;t do the diagonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">that is wrong it&#39;s like you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">a j you&#39;re starting at the bottom of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">j and going to the top</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the lower hand doing this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">where the name of the move comes from</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.520" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s brushing past the knee do you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">that as my hips turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">it brushes past the knee and then as my</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">weight settles</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">it comes beside as if there&#39;s a plank</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">coming right out of my leg and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">slapping that plank</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">like that not locked not locked this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.479" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">this is right living living joints not</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.479" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">dead lockwoods</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s put that together and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">i&#39;ll do it side on</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">okay so i got my hands turn</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">brushing the knee doing that j with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">upper hand</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">okay what does this look like side on</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">put those right foot goes 45 left foot</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">as i said rotating down rotating up all</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">at once</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">all at once everything starts and stops</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">at the same time step</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">brushing the knee with the lower hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">doing the j with the upper hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.039" style="s2">okay let&#39;s do that again</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.520" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">okay now in tai chi walking</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">right meditative walking you would bring</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">your weight back</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">and your toe would come up because</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pivot okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">so i&#39;ve done this as my weight comes</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">back my hands come in like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">you see you&#39;re coming in you know almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">ah like that okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">and then when i pivot and i align the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">knee all of these are now aligned</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">this hand this hand knee toe</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:48.000" style="s2">everything&#39;s aligned</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">okay now here&#39;s the very difficult part</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">remember in meditative walking you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:56.720" style="s2">turn all your weight onto this hip and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">bring this foot up</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.720" end="00:08:00.400" style="s2">remember this when i do this i switch my</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">hands</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.400" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">this rotates in and this rotates down</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m like this right let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">get there again here back</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">align the three switch</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">here back</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.639" style="s2">align the three switch</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">here back align the three</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">switch and then you do the brushing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">this side</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">all right this is the the reverse j here</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">well this is a normal j the bottom to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.000" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">here this is like the reverse j on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">side right i guess it&#39;s more like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">loopy l</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a better way this is a j</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">and this is now</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">right and then this is brushing the knee</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">okay let&#39;s put the two together</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.160" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">so turn the foot on right foot 45</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">left foot comes up so you can pivot here</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">pivot</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">step brush the knee this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">looping now</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">back align switch</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">brush the knee now you can repeat back</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">align switch</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">okay let&#39;s try this again</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">and get reminder don&#39;t have it in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">arms if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">but if you can do the full-blown brush</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">knee it&#39;s a very very powerful movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">practice okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">okay so align</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">switch now let&#39;s say i want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">okay so remember what we do with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.079" style="s2">foot movement just reminder this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">foot but you see how</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.960" style="s2">let&#39;s answer a couple of questions</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">this is from karima you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">something about time yesterday seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.480" style="s2">like so long ago</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">have you read this book or recommend</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.480" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">existential and ontological dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">in heidegger and dojo um i</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t i have not read that uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">uh question that&#39;s where i have not read</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:51.520" style="s2">that book</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">i think we might have had this question</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.520" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">before too by the way um</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">yeah um i&#39;ve read a similar book on</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">comparing dojin and heidegger on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">sense of time</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">but i think um that&#39;s a a good book to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">consider one of the things that i</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">plan to do when i do the series um</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">on the god beyond god and reinventing</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">which is exploring the non-theistic</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">tradition and how it&#39;s emerging</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">on into prominence right now is i want</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">to devote a significant chunk to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">yoda school the kyoto school tried</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">to integrate between</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">heideggerian continental</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">uh phenomenological philosophy which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">very much about trying to recover</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">um the the sense of embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">embeddedness</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">of all the four e&#39;s that are important</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">um and also bring back the sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">of the sacredness of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:03.919" style="s2">so that whole philosophical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">and also the pragmatism that came out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.919" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">james</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">so some very important um</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">western philosophy with important</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">aspects from buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">and a bit of taoism within zen and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">kyoto school tried to integrate them</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">very deeply together</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">um and both</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:28.320" style="s2">dojin who represents</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">the zen tradition and heidegger saw some</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.320" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">very profound connections</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">uh between the sense of time the sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">of being um</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:37.440" style="s2">pon h a n in his recent book the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">has explored that in great depth and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:49.120" style="s2">in which our current ways of being</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">and seeing so fragment he calls it</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.120" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">atomized time</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">that this has a deeply fragmenting</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">effect on our own sense of being um and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">and in that sense i think uh and chris</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">monster piano agrees with me on this</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">contributes very significantly to uh the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">current meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">um so han actually talks about an</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">ability to linger with things</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">think about how that just picks up on so</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">of what we are trying to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">and sense of reciprocal opening and</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">being coupled to things</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:31.600" style="s2">and off um recovering a profound ability</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">to linger things to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.600" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">with things couple things together in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">the unfolding of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">so that we satie we remember that we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">mortals</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">we are inherently temporal beings</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">temporal beings who nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">an eternity into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">and puts you into right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">with that right relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">time and eternity</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">so we&#39;ll try and get some more questions</p>
