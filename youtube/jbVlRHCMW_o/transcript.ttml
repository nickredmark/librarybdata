<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:18.570" style="s2">fundamentalists so Jim I tweeted that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.859" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">out and Jim reached out to me and said</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.570" end="00:01:22.499" style="s2">they&#39;d like me to come on his podcast do</p>

<p begin="00:01:37.829" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">this game a fundamentalism can Co vid we</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.499" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">might have a brief exchange and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:46.679" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna open up to Q&amp;A to the group</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">box I think it&#39;s some graffiti from</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.950" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">China</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">it basically says we can&#39;t return to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:24.260" style="s2">normal because the normal that we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">was precisely</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.260" end="00:02:28.980" style="s2">so with that I&#39;ll head over to Jim for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">some opening thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.980" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">hey thanks Peter thanks for asking me to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">be on the stoah great work that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:39.810" style="s2">doing is we talked earlier there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">many people who who are physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.810" end="00:02:45.420" style="s2">isolated particularly those isolated by</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:47.819" style="s2">themselves for whom these kinds of four</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.420" end="00:02:50.069" style="s2">are unbelievably valuable you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.819" end="00:02:52.739" style="s2">myself I&#39;m very fortunate that I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.069" end="00:02:54.989" style="s2">my beloved wife and my daughter and her</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:57.120" style="s2">husband and four of us are having</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.989" end="00:02:58.290" style="s2">frankly too good a time together up here</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.120" end="00:03:00.510" style="s2">in the mountains but I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.290" end="00:03:02.280" style="s2">people are really struggling and so any</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.510" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">kind of social interaction there</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.280" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">conviviality that can be brought</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:07.830" style="s2">together over the Internet&#39;s is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">wonderful thing so thank you for your</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.830" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">good work yes I was quite taken with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:14.430" style="s2">your quote and it fit in fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">with a conceptual framework which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.430" end="00:03:21.090" style="s2">developing for the backside of kovat</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">when we think about complex dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.090" end="00:03:26.610" style="s2">networks particularly social networks we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.910" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">can think about two ways they respond to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.610" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">a a probe or a shock and in network</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:39.000" style="s2">theory dynamic network theory we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">think of those two as homeostasis which</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.000" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">is the tendency to return to the state</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">that you&#39;re in consider the human body</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:50.450" style="s2">life itself is I would argue and have</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:53.519" style="s2">argued is measured by its homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.450" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">particularly on the a couple of seconds</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.519" end="00:03:59.790" style="s2">or minute level of gases oxygen co2</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">nutrients toxins that circulate real</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.790" end="00:04:05.459" style="s2">time and most shocks to the human body</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:07.560" style="s2">result in homeostasis so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.459" end="00:04:10.440" style="s2">you get a cold your immune system reacts</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.560" end="00:04:12.570" style="s2">defeats the cold you return to where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.440" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">are on the other hand a bullet through</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.570" end="00:04:20.729" style="s2">the heart is a hysteresis event the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">cycles break down the the oxygen and co2</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.729" end="00:04:25.560" style="s2">no longer circulate the toxins and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">nutrients and you transform from being a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2">living organism through a pile of rotten</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:32.550" style="s2">meat so that&#39;s a hysteresis event and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:35.010" style="s2">there are things in between you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.550" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">cold you fully recover from you get your</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.010" end="00:04:38.150" style="s2">leg cut off in a farming accident</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:40.340" style="s2">well you&#39;re not going to grow that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.150" end="00:04:41.510" style="s2">back that&#39;s a hysteresis event and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.340" end="00:04:44.570" style="s2">will have a very different life</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.510" end="00:04:47.510" style="s2">trajectory afterwards now now we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.570" end="00:04:50.810" style="s2">apply the same thinking to our social</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.510" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">economic operating system and this koban</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.810" end="00:04:56.660" style="s2">19 event is a major shock certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:59.150" style="s2">most major shock since World War two at</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.660" end="00:05:02.900" style="s2">least in the West and to what degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.150" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">will the response be homeostasis the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.900" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">tendency for the network to re weave</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:11.150" style="s2">itself back together the way it was and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">to what degree will it be hysteresis</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.150" end="00:05:19.060" style="s2">that is the tendency be knocked into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:24.830" style="s2">new trajectory that is not predetermined</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.060" end="00:05:28.610" style="s2">by the gestalt of what we called game a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.830" end="00:05:30.590" style="s2">and when I saw your quote I said ah this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.610" end="00:05:32.750" style="s2">is very interesting because as we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.590" end="00:05:34.340" style="s2">Peter has done this extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.750" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">interesting piece of work I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.340" end="00:05:38.990" style="s2">what was it a year and a half ago where</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">he delineating the tribes I mean I refer</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.990" end="00:05:43.820" style="s2">people to that document all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:45.500" style="s2">it is such an illuminating document</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.820" end="00:05:46.700" style="s2">makes you think about the world and in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.500" end="00:05:48.610" style="s2">really truly different way it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.700" end="00:05:51.200" style="s2">profound and important document and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.610" end="00:05:54.850" style="s2">we&#39;ll put a link to that document up on</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.200" end="00:05:59.540" style="s2">the podcast version of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.850" end="00:06:01.640" style="s2">and I was thinking ah it&#39;s when we think</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.540" end="00:06:03.140" style="s2">about society while these tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.640" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">artificial they&#39;re you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.140" end="00:06:06.920" style="s2">real people don&#39;t really live in these</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:09.410" style="s2">tribes they are a very useful way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.920" end="00:06:12.890" style="s2">think about it and one of the big forces</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.410" end="00:06:17.090" style="s2">for homeostasis ie the world going back</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.890" end="00:06:19.780" style="s2">to where it was will be aptly named</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.090" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">group coined by Peter a game a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.780" end="00:06:23.960" style="s2">fundamentalist I guess I should take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:26.750" style="s2">moment here put my cards on the table</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.960" end="00:06:28.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working along with a number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.750" end="00:06:33.700" style="s2">other people Laura large number of other</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.730" end="00:06:37.190" style="s2">people on something called game B since</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.700" end="00:06:39.140" style="s2">2013 where we are attempting to craft a</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.490" end="00:08:19.159" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to mind so I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.250" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">a decent sensitivity to the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.159" end="00:08:22.729" style="s2">that are at play</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:24.770" style="s2">kind of like the ideologies or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.729" end="00:08:26.090" style="s2">philosophies in the wild not in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.770" end="00:08:27.500" style="s2">textbooks but are like happening under</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.500" end="00:08:34.789" style="s2">that and also kind of leaning into the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.659" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">emotions and then the states surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.789" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">those narratives and fueling them and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:41.630" style="s2">think what when I like that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:43.579" style="s2">you made of the homeostasis fishes the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.630" end="00:08:45.350" style="s2">hysteresis it&#39;s almost like two</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.579" end="00:08:47.420" style="s2">narratives are emerging from this kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.350" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">of like uncertain liminal space that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.420" end="00:08:52.820" style="s2">were in that&#39;s like team homeostasis and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:54.110" style="s2">team hysteresis and I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.820" end="00:08:56.740" style="s2">tracking the last couple of days but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.110" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">curious if you&#39;re seeing these these</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.740" end="00:09:02.029" style="s2">teams kind of like come to head</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.709" style="s2">truthfully I haven&#39;t seen the last</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:04.630" style="s2">couple of days as I mentioned I take a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.709" end="00:09:07.960" style="s2">two day intern</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.630" end="00:09:10.360" style="s2">sabbatical over the weekend and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.960" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">gonna recommend that as a unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.360" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">powerful practice I used to do it been</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:17.770" style="s2">doing it for a year and a half year and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:20.230" style="s2">a half but then probably starting in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.770" end="00:09:22.630" style="s2">early February I&#39;ve been wallowing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.230" end="00:09:24.100" style="s2">this stuff on the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.630" end="00:09:26.020" style="s2">truthfully you know if I look at the you</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.100" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">know the incidence of cases in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.020" end="00:09:30.190" style="s2">Bangladesh what the hell can I do about</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">it what does it tell me not much but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.190" end="00:09:35.500" style="s2">sure have wasted a lot of time on it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.320" end="00:09:37.870" style="s2">prior to that you know I can look back</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.500" end="00:09:40.090" style="s2">and say the people in the game B world</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.870" end="00:09:41.710" style="s2">and in the broader what we call the big</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.090" end="00:09:46.030" style="s2">change movement the you know the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.710" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">regenerative ecology you know the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.030" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">and crisis people they all see this as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:53.770" style="s2">real opportunity right both a tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">and an opportunity however what I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.770" end="00:09:58.060" style="s2">say people the average person who</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:10:01.180" style="s2">follows their nose through life which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.060" end="00:10:02.950" style="s2">most people are fervently hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.180" end="00:10:06.340" style="s2">this is just a blip and that life goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.950" end="00:10:08.380" style="s2">back to normal I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.340" end="00:10:10.840" style="s2">the closing thought that you had about</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.380" end="00:10:12.790" style="s2">how do we come into dialogue with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.840" end="00:10:14.650" style="s2">game be fundamentalists or the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.790" end="00:10:17.350" style="s2">that are being influenced by them you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.650" end="00:10:19.930" style="s2">have any thoughts oh how we might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.350" end="00:10:22.480" style="s2">able to do that now yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.930" end="00:10:24.220" style="s2">unfortunately where game B is a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.480" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">behind the curve we did not expect this</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.220" end="00:10:29.740" style="s2">crisis to occur so rapidly we expected a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:32.770" style="s2">crisis but of course being a complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.740" end="00:10:35.740" style="s2">adaptive system the predictability such</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.770" end="00:10:37.180" style="s2">crisis are almost zero right we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.740" end="00:10:39.400" style="s2">know when or where they came but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.180" end="00:10:41.590" style="s2">came before it would have been nice</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.400" end="00:10:45.190" style="s2">because unfortunately we do not yet have</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.590" end="00:10:48.070" style="s2">the kind of popular narrative about game</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.190" end="00:10:49.870" style="s2">B that would have been really good to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.070" end="00:10:51.460" style="s2">able to point out but here&#39;s our six</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.870" end="00:10:53.800" style="s2">minute video that explains what an</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.460" end="00:10:55.990" style="s2">alternative way of organizing society</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.800" end="00:10:58.260" style="s2">looks like so the best we can do is kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.990" end="00:11:01.180" style="s2">of freelance it and so unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.260" end="00:11:03.910" style="s2">probably we can&#39;t right now use this as</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.180" end="00:11:08.080" style="s2">the transition event right but what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.910" end="00:11:11.100" style="s2">can do is grow the cadre find people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.080" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">are approximate who are not game a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">fundamentalism I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:15.130" style="s2">distinction that there are gaming</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:17.200" style="s2">fundamentalists we&#39;re not reachable</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.130" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">right now but there are other people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.200" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:22.110" style="s2">following game a through inertia and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:23.910" style="s2">this is an opportunity to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.110" end="00:11:27.199" style="s2">this is just another manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.910" end="00:11:30.089" style="s2">how broken game a is right you know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.199" end="00:11:33.269" style="s2">society organized in the game beasts way</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.089" end="00:11:34.860" style="s2">so that things are modular and localized</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.269" end="00:11:38.370" style="s2">would have been very easy to stop this</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.860" end="00:11:40.019" style="s2">right if hot spot occurs in a game v</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.370" end="00:11:43.829" style="s2">world we would say all right shut down</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.019" end="00:11:45.990" style="s2">module New Rochelle right and New</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.829" end="00:11:48.810" style="s2">Rochelle would have had been evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.990" end="00:11:50.760" style="s2">be very self-sufficient I had you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.810" end="00:11:53.610" style="s2">stockpiled plenty of material and food</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.760" end="00:11:55.260" style="s2">to get by for six months and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.610" end="00:11:57.060" style="s2">no great hardship to just sniff the</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.260" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">connections to New Rochelle and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.060" end="00:12:03.060" style="s2">internalize it unfortunately money on a</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:04.980" style="s2">world defined only by money on money</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.060" end="00:12:07.769" style="s2">return efficiency which is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.980" end="00:12:10.550" style="s2">game a inevitably builds all these</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.769" end="00:12:13.769" style="s2">highly complex cross links which are</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.550" end="00:12:16.170" style="s2">nominal money on money return efficient</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.769" end="00:12:19.860" style="s2">but they are not worried the robust or</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.170" end="00:12:21.570" style="s2">resilient and communicating that concept</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.860" end="00:12:23.430" style="s2">frankly we&#39;re not ready to communicate</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.570" end="00:12:25.529" style="s2">it to the masses yet but we are ready to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.430" end="00:12:27.899" style="s2">communicate it to the ears who will hear</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.529" end="00:12:29.940" style="s2">right so I see this as an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.899" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">grow the cadre from a few tens of</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.940" end="00:12:33.690" style="s2">thousands of people to maybe a few</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:36.120" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of people over the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.690" end="00:12:38.880" style="s2">next 90 days yeah I like that a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.120" end="00:12:40.529" style="s2">like you said the game a fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.880" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">some of them might be we can&#39;t reach</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.529" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">them or like we put Jordan houses the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">blue church priests you know like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">the best not the audience that we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">to reach but there&#39;s just like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:53.339" style="s2">this term and the stoah someone was</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:55.110" style="s2">talking about how a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.339" end="00:12:57.329" style="s2">Apocalypse memes are happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.110" end="00:13:01.319" style="s2">and the etymology of the word apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.329" end="00:13:03.899" style="s2">is to uncover to reveal and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.319" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">heating contact with reality quite hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.899" end="00:13:08.010" style="s2">right now and a lot of the is</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:10.290" style="s2">being revealed just like kick</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.010" end="00:13:11.490" style="s2">case-in-point my wife you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.290" end="00:13:13.800" style="s2">gets to work from home she works at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.490" end="00:13:15.180" style="s2">university and then she&#39;s loving it you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.800" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">know she&#39;s getting more work done she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.180" end="00:13:19.620" style="s2">enjoying life more instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">driving like an hour to work all these</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.620" end="00:13:23.490" style="s2">useless meetings just to work like two</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:25.079" style="s2">or three hours a day type thing so just</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.490" end="00:13:27.000" style="s2">like little things little scripts are</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.079" end="00:13:29.130" style="s2">being revealed as not necessary as a lie</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.000" end="00:13:30.840" style="s2">and I think this is like an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.130" end="00:13:32.880" style="s2">to kind of lean on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.840" end="00:13:34.370" style="s2">absolutely and I&#39;ve been predicting it</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.880" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">and frankly in doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.370" end="00:13:38.910" style="s2">adjusting my investment portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:41.730" style="s2">because I believe that will be a series</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.910" end="00:13:44.370" style="s2">of mini history sees for instance</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.730" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">business travel what a waste of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.370" end="00:13:49.320" style="s2">time energy and depletion of our</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.420" style="s2">atmosphere you know flying from New York</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.320" end="00:13:53.160" style="s2">to San Francisco for a one-hour meeting</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.420" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">which I have done countless times in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.160" end="00:13:57.480" style="s2">life so typically not New York either</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:59.490" style="s2">Boston or Washington and we should have</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.480" end="00:14:01.200" style="s2">stopped doing as much business travel as</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.490" end="00:14:03.180" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing eight or ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.200" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">once the internet got really fast and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.180" end="00:14:07.980" style="s2">stable we had good tools now that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.930" style="s2">everybody is using zoom or Skype or</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.980" end="00:14:12.360" style="s2">WebEx or what have you they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.930" end="00:14:14.100" style="s2">what the hell were you doing sitting</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.360" end="00:14:16.380" style="s2">around the country alright how annoying</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.100" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">is it to go from you know a horrible</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.380" end="00:14:21.870" style="s2">airport to a beige hotel to uber to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:25.580" style="s2">generic conference room and back spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.870" end="00:14:29.580" style="s2">36 hours and $3,000 that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.580" end="00:14:32.220" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve been doing 5 to 20 zooms a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.580" end="00:14:33.990" style="s2">week now for the last year and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.220" end="00:14:35.490" style="s2">that habit will be spreading</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.990" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">exponentially and so that many</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.490" end="00:14:41.250" style="s2">hysteresis will certainly occur the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:43.080" style="s2">other thing which I I as I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.250" end="00:14:45.000" style="s2">about this this morning I wish I&#39;d said</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.080" end="00:14:46.950" style="s2">it earlier but I&#39;ll say it now which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:49.650" style="s2">this uncovering I&#39;ll I love that is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.950" end="00:14:54.330" style="s2">know that was the root of apocalypse but</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.650" end="00:14:57.090" style="s2">think about the fact that we are having</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.330" end="00:15:00.630" style="s2">ourselves personally evolved by the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.090" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">shock and the analogy I came up with it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.630" end="00:15:05.400" style="s2">may or may not be true but it seems true</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:08.010" style="s2">so what the hell all right think of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.400" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">60s which really started rolling in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.010" end="00:15:15.750" style="s2">about 1965 slowly then exponentially by</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:19.110" style="s2">67 then went crazy into the early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.750" end="00:15:21.390" style="s2">there were two huge shocks to especially</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.110" end="00:15:24.690" style="s2">American society where the 60s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.390" end="00:15:28.190" style="s2">took off the first was the Cuban Missile</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.690" end="00:15:31.080" style="s2">Crisis right the Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.190" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">outlined the absurdity the literal</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.080" end="00:15:37.620" style="s2">insanity of the nature of game a at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">time two superpowers were 30,000 nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.620" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">missiles pointed each other&#39;s big cities</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.480" end="00:15:44.339" style="s2">then the second one was the Kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.670" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">assassination here it was the hope of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.339" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2">change suddenly cut down and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:52.589" style="s2">co-opted by a classic political operator</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">Lyndon Johnson who did do some good but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.589" end="00:15:58.680" style="s2">was certainly not a JFK I have long</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:16:01.499" style="s2">believed that those two events shook the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.680" end="00:16:04.139" style="s2">soul of many Americans not all Americans</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.499" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">not even a majority and that that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.139" end="00:16:09.779" style="s2">the seed which sprouted a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:12.120" style="s2">years later as the 60s so if we think of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.779" end="00:16:13.860" style="s2">these shocks that are happening to our</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.120" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">souls and these are the biggest shocks</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.860" end="00:16:17.459" style="s2">that have happened to the souls of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:18.689" style="s2">individuals since World War two I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.459" end="00:16:20.759" style="s2">gonna say they&#39;re bigger than either the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.689" end="00:16:24.589" style="s2">cuban missile crisis or the kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.759" end="00:16:27.629" style="s2">assassination or 9/11 even if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.589" end="00:16:30.389" style="s2">produce the game a to game B transition</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.629" end="00:16:32.790" style="s2">right now they are opening people&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.389" end="00:16:35.100" style="s2">that they&#39;re giving them ears to hear in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.790" end="00:16:36.779" style="s2">ways that they had never had before so</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.100" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">they will not only can we recruit a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.779" end="00:16:42.839" style="s2">cadre of maybe 10x more in the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:45.749" style="s2">three months but maybe 10 or 15% of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.839" end="00:16:48.689" style="s2">people have had their cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.749" end="00:16:52.649" style="s2">apparatus primed for more for bigger</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.689" end="00:16:55.439" style="s2">challenges to game a right right this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.649" end="00:16:57.269" style="s2">so uh I&#39;ll make one more statement or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.439" end="00:16:59.699" style="s2">question and then so if anyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.269" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">question for for Jim just write it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.699" end="00:17:03.959" style="s2">the chat box and then I will either</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:05.309" style="s2">calling you or I&#39;ll read on your behalf</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.959" end="00:17:09.000" style="s2">if you would like me to read it on your</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.309" end="00:17:10.500" style="s2">path so the last thing I&#39;ll share no I</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.000" end="00:17:12.390" style="s2">want I want to see how this lands for</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.500" end="00:17:14.549" style="s2">you John Drake II my friend John</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.390" end="00:17:17.429" style="s2">reveille he was on this the stoah last</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.549" end="00:17:18.449" style="s2">week and he said something boldly you</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.429" end="00:17:21.120" style="s2">never could never heard him talk like</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.449" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">this he says he wants to steal the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:25.169" style="s2">culture away from those who have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:27.209" style="s2">abusing us for so long I was like woo</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.169" end="00:17:29.880" style="s2">and this that phrase steal the culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.209" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">because we can&#39;t win by playing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.880" end="00:17:34.500" style="s2">previous game you know that that Joe</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">Montana quote comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.500" end="00:17:39.240" style="s2">he ain&#39;t cheating any trying right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.960" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">why try to win a corrupt game or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.240" end="00:17:43.649" style="s2">like a pathologically designed game so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:46.230" style="s2">I&#39;m curious how does that phrase land</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.649" end="00:17:48.630" style="s2">for you steal a culture absolutely love</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.230" end="00:17:50.010" style="s2">it right I think that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.630" end="00:17:51.870" style="s2">and is what we&#39;ve been trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.010" end="00:17:54.179" style="s2">out how to do slowly but surely in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.870" end="00:17:55.890" style="s2">game be world we&#39;re not going to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.179" end="00:17:58.250" style="s2">head-to-head with the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.890" end="00:18:00.770" style="s2">start the green church or anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.250" end="00:18:04.010" style="s2">like that we&#39;re gonna instead operate in</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.770" end="00:18:07.190" style="s2">a decentralized self-organizing network</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.010" end="00:18:10.210" style="s2">centric fashion and if we can grow I</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:12.140" style="s2">would say grow the alternative culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.210" end="00:18:15.500" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s a little bit better than</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.140" end="00:18:18.860" style="s2">steal the culture though though I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.500" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">going to stop and say maybe the events</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.860" end="00:18:23.150" style="s2">of this magnitude may allow us to steal</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:25.340" style="s2">the culture and and that may be that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.150" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">call the short journey to game B I</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.340" end="00:18:30.170" style="s2">recently wrote an essay and medium</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:33.170" style="s2">called a journey to game be what&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.170" end="00:18:36.260" style="s2">out the non apocalyptic road to game B</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.170" end="00:18:38.090" style="s2">over 60 years and I promised in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.260" end="00:18:41.990" style="s2">essay to also write the short road to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.090" end="00:18:44.210" style="s2">game B which is around an apocalypse and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.990" end="00:18:47.450" style="s2">while this may not be quite extreme</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.210" end="00:18:49.220" style="s2">enough apocalypse it might be so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.450" end="00:18:51.740" style="s2">worth thinking about but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.220" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">growing the alternative to the culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.740" end="00:18:56.660" style="s2">maybe a little bit more accurate but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:59.300" style="s2">end result is the same that the that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.660" end="00:19:01.550" style="s2">trajectory the world line of culture has</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.300" end="00:19:06.800" style="s2">to move to a new basin of Attraction</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.550" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">right right okay so Greg Walsh you have</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.800" end="00:19:11.680" style="s2">a question would you like to go off mute</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:11.680" style="s2">and ask it to Jim</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.780" end="00:19:22.040" style="s2">alright I&#39;ll read the question then see</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.250" end="00:19:24.049" style="s2">if I can expand so how does the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.040" end="00:19:26.690" style="s2">stratification of cultures development</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.049" end="00:19:29.049" style="s2">affect our strategy or what we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.690" end="00:19:32.570" style="s2">expect implement in gaming principles</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.049" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">and then so must the culture have at</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.570" end="00:19:37.670" style="s2">least for their center of gravity in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:39.500" style="s2">modern framework so you know this group</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.670" end="00:19:43.549" style="s2">is like pretty meta I would say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.500" end="00:19:46.610" style="s2">just thinking big big questions here but</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.549" end="00:19:49.700" style="s2">uh so I mean for us to sort of pass</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.910" end="00:20:20.150" style="s2">absolutely and I would say that it would</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.410" end="00:20:23.480" style="s2">probably have been a fool&#39;s errand to</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.150" end="00:20:26.210" style="s2">try to build game B in 1935 you know or</p>

<p begin="00:20:26.210" end="00:20:30.890" style="s2">probably 1955 was the high-water mark of</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.890" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">right something like game B would not</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:39.830" style="s2">and so it is the prerequisites that game</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.460" end="00:20:43.700" style="s2">a created that have allowed game B to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.830" end="00:20:47.270" style="s2">emerge for instance the internet for</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:08.929" style="s2">all incompetent almost all went bust</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:10.940" style="s2">these are much more well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.929" end="00:21:12.860" style="s2">because they&#39;re there&#39;s a much stronger</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.860" end="00:21:17.570" style="s2">prerequisites are absolutely important</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.049" end="00:21:20.090" style="s2">and as you mentioned an important one</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.570" end="00:21:21.890" style="s2">will be decentralized energy that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.090" end="00:21:24.410" style="s2">change a lot of thinking when you&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.890" end="00:21:26.419" style="s2">longer dependent fully on the grid you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.410" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">may have used the grid as a backup and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.419" end="00:21:30.510" style="s2">there&#39;s some important sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:32.820" style="s2">mathematical and network topology</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.510" end="00:21:35.040" style="s2">why you still want a grid but if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.820" end="00:21:36.930" style="s2">have you know say 50% of your</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.750" end="00:21:41.940" style="s2">whole lot of things that answer your</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.940" end="00:21:46.380" style="s2">yeah sure and then I guess so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.430" end="00:21:48.990" style="s2">pass through that then so again it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.380" end="00:21:51.030" style="s2">and then another I guess so much answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:53.510" style="s2">is that you know what other</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.030" end="00:21:56.610" style="s2">opportunities do we see then for</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.510" end="00:21:58.620" style="s2">cultures who haven&#39;t even passed through</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.610" end="00:22:00.360" style="s2">that you know again I keep thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.620" end="00:22:03.030" style="s2">like third world countries that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.360" end="00:22:04.520" style="s2">even passed through that yet well some</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.030" end="00:22:07.860" style="s2">ways they have some advantages right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.520" end="00:22:10.020" style="s2">give you for instance even not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.860" end="00:22:12.060" style="s2">third-world countries like even Japan</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.020" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">which had relatively rudimentary</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.060" end="00:22:17.190" style="s2">wireline telephony they just left over</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:19.560" style="s2">all that in the 90s we went directly to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.190" end="00:22:21.240" style="s2">sell technology I have a good friend</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.560" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">Thor Muller who was actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.240" end="00:22:26.550" style="s2">cofounders of game B who has been very</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:29.340" style="s2">active with his company in selling</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.550" end="00:22:32.130" style="s2">totally localized sort of Hut level</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.340" end="00:22:34.290" style="s2">solar energy in East Africa for instance</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.130" end="00:22:36.990" style="s2">they may not build out a National Grid</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.290" end="00:22:39.510" style="s2">in East Africa and so they can follow</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.990" end="00:22:42.360" style="s2">with these prerequisites and stitch</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.510" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">together their own appropriate society</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.360" end="00:22:49.350" style="s2">right right okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:51.450" style="s2">you know cool so um amy has a question</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.350" end="00:22:53.970" style="s2">and she actually might have a better</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.450" end="00:22:56.130" style="s2">cleaners in game a fundamentalist and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.970" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">she said game a reactionaries I like</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.130" end="00:22:59.430" style="s2">that so Amy would you like to go out</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:03.030" style="s2">mute and ask your question to Jim</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.430" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">sure hi everyone hi Jim so basically I</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.030" end="00:23:09.180" style="s2">was wondering if game B is just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:12.780" style="s2">a natural evolution that will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.180" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">occurring from game a so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.780" end="00:23:19.140" style="s2">seeing game B is a reaction to game a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.860" end="00:23:21.780" style="s2">it&#39;s more like an evolution and as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.140" end="00:23:25.590" style="s2">people that are involved in game being</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.780" end="00:23:27.870" style="s2">now are sort of more early adopters than</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.590" end="00:23:28.110" style="s2">game a reactionaries does that make</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.870" end="00:23:30.060" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.110" end="00:23:32.370" style="s2">makes perfect sense and it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.060" end="00:23:35.100" style="s2">exactly how we&#39;ve long thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.370" end="00:23:39.000" style="s2">the original game B team included two</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.100" end="00:23:43.050" style="s2">evolutionary scientists Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.000" end="00:23:44.280" style="s2">and John Wilkins and so evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.050" end="00:23:47.070" style="s2">thinking was fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.280" end="00:23:50.280" style="s2">to the ethos of game B and then we also</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.070" end="00:23:52.770" style="s2">had in our startup team several</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.280" end="00:23:54.300" style="s2">successful executive business executives</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.770" end="00:23:58.980" style="s2">who had essentially marketing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.300" end="00:24:01.920" style="s2">backgrounds myself Jordan Hall Mike</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.980" end="00:24:03.960" style="s2">Needham a couple others and we always</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.920" end="00:24:06.270" style="s2">use the language of innovator early</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.960" end="00:24:08.760" style="s2">adopter early majority late majority and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.270" end="00:24:10.890" style="s2">laggards right and so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.760" end="00:24:14.580" style="s2">absolutely appropriate to think of game</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.890" end="00:24:17.490" style="s2">B as a natural evolution from game a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.580" end="00:24:19.530" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s not the only one I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.490" end="00:24:22.110" style="s2">have written an essay called in search</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.530" end="00:24:24.750" style="s2">of the fifth attractor on medium where I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.110" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">lay out other alternatives and you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.750" end="00:24:29.310" style="s2">see that you know game B is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:31.560" style="s2">alternative other alternatives that seem</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.310" end="00:24:35.280" style="s2">like they could also evolve out of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.560" end="00:24:36.900" style="s2">are neo-fascism I would give China its</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.280" end="00:24:39.180" style="s2">example of neo-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.900" end="00:24:41.790" style="s2">I can easily see game a transitioning to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.180" end="00:24:44.790" style="s2">Chinese style state capitalism plus</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.790" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">militarism plus nationalism neo</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.790" end="00:24:49.980" style="s2">feudalism to my mind extreme</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">libertarianism of the Peter teal or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.980" end="00:24:54.780" style="s2">Koch brothers variety is really a form</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:57.390" style="s2">of feudalism where there&#39;s a few at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.780" end="00:24:59.040" style="s2">top who build a hierarchy of control via</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.390" end="00:25:00.420" style="s2">money of the people underneath them I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.040" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">could actually see our society going</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.420" end="00:25:05.730" style="s2">that way I could see us transitioning to</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:08.010" style="s2">a neo Dark Ages if somehow the religious</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.730" end="00:25:11.040" style="s2">fundamentalists use this moment to</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.010" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">mobilize and move us from a game a</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.040" end="00:25:15.930" style="s2">operating system to something like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">Dark Ages where religion was everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.930" end="00:25:21.780" style="s2">and of course you know our anti friend</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.080" end="00:25:24.300" style="s2">chaos is always an alternative you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.780" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">if the infrastructure breaks down we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.300" end="00:25:29.970" style="s2">could end up in a chaotic regime which</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:32.820" style="s2">would not be good so game a to game B is</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.970" end="00:25:34.950" style="s2">an evolutionary potential pathway but</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.820" end="00:25:38.310" style="s2">when we have to fight for to land in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.950" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">this right v attractor which we believe</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.310" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">makes for a much better world for us and</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.630" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">we talked about that we hope even within</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.330" end="00:26:48.600" style="s2">the game a context let&#39;s call it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:52.100" style="s2">know enlighten game a ISM that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.600" end="00:26:56.300" style="s2">to find a way to deflect our social</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.800" end="00:27:02.760" style="s2">deficiency and investing in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:04.290" style="s2">Carrington event is a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.760" end="00:27:08.850" style="s2">for those who don&#39;t know there was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.290" end="00:27:12.120" style="s2">major solar flare was it 1857 something</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.850" end="00:27:15.630" style="s2">like that during the era before</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.120" end="00:27:18.180" style="s2">electricity was at all a thing but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.630" end="00:27:20.220" style="s2">telegraph was a thing and the solar</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.180" end="00:27:22.110" style="s2">flare basically hit the telegraph lines</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.220" end="00:27:24.840" style="s2">and was telegraph lines worked as</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.110" end="00:27:27.000" style="s2">antennas which concentrated the solar</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.840" end="00:27:29.280" style="s2">flare and produced fires and actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.000" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">killed a couple telegraph operators it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.280" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">now thought that if we had a solar flare</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:34.830" style="s2">of that intensity today it would utterly</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:36.990" style="s2">destroy the grid or at least it would</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.830" end="00:27:38.580" style="s2">destroy enough of the key components</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.990" end="00:27:41.240" style="s2">that it could be a year or two before</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.580" end="00:27:43.260" style="s2">the grid came up and I should add the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.240" end="00:27:45.330" style="s2">astronomers believe a Carrington event</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.260" end="00:27:48.630" style="s2">solar flare hitting the earth is about a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.330" end="00:27:51.180" style="s2">1 in 500 chance so essentially two</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.630" end="00:27:53.250" style="s2">tenths of a percent per year that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.180" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">big percent right you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.250" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2">someone were to say with a two-tenths of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:27:59.010" style="s2">a percent per year of having a nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:28:01.170" style="s2">war we&#39;d be ourselves pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.010" end="00:28:03.510" style="s2">much right though I will say that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.170" end="00:28:04.740" style="s2">we thought of it 1962 during the Cuban</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.510" end="00:28:07.770" style="s2">Missile Crisis probably thought it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.740" end="00:28:09.180" style="s2">more like 5% a year but it&#39;s insane that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.770" end="00:28:11.740" style="s2">we have not taken the relatively</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.740" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">to be able to recover much more rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.290" end="00:28:18.610" style="s2">from a Carrington event for instance</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:20.410" style="s2">storing replacements for the</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.410" end="00:28:22.960" style="s2">them sitting right next to the other</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.430" end="00:28:24.370" style="s2">Transformers you want them in places</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.960" end="00:28:27.160" style="s2">where they won&#39;t be hit by the solar</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.370" end="00:28:29.560" style="s2">flare further having physical breaks in</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.160" end="00:28:31.860" style="s2">the wiring that could be literally ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.560" end="00:28:34.180" style="s2">foot of wire taken out in many places</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.860" end="00:28:35.770" style="s2">the nice thing about a solar flare you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.180" end="00:28:38.680" style="s2">have two or three days warning which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.770" end="00:28:41.290" style="s2">an unusual kind of event so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.680" end="00:28:43.930" style="s2">absolutely i hope i hope that this</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.290" end="00:28:46.510" style="s2">priming and we think of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.930" end="00:28:47.920" style="s2">science concept of priming you see one</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.510" end="00:28:50.140" style="s2">thing and then you see other things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.920" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">fit the same pattern so you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.140" end="00:28:54.940" style="s2">especially in in the united states and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:28:57.160" style="s2">then much of western europe</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.940" end="00:28:59.320" style="s2">we were grossly under invested why</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.160" end="00:29:02.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t we have stockpiles of ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.320" end="00:29:05.890" style="s2">why didn&#39;t we have stockpiles of 95 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.110" end="00:29:08.260" style="s2">n99 masks very inexpensive hedge for</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.890" end="00:29:10.810" style="s2">what everybody knew was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.260" end="00:29:13.210" style="s2">you know these virus pandemics have been</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.810" end="00:29:16.050" style="s2">happening about every eight to ten years</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.210" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">for several years and anyone who studies</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.050" end="00:29:20.110" style="s2">statistical variation knows that sooner</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:21.940" style="s2">or later a strong one was going to hit</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.110" end="00:29:23.980" style="s2">and this is by no means the strongest</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.940" end="00:29:26.470" style="s2">one that could have had so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.980" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">this is a gigantic wake up lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.470" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">will help us prepare not only for</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:33.130" style="s2">pandemics but for other exogenous events</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:37.240" style="s2">such as solar flares</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.130" end="00:29:40.210" style="s2">you know EMPs by terrorists cyberattacks</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.240" end="00:29:42.610" style="s2">on our financial and communications</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.210" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">infrastructure etc so excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.610" end="00:29:47.110" style="s2">thank you okay we have a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">questions we might not get to all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.110" end="00:29:51.540" style="s2">them and I&#39;m not reading them out in</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:55.180" style="s2">order so I&#39;m using my discernment here</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.540" end="00:29:59.830" style="s2">but let&#39;s go next with Benjamin thanks</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.180" end="00:30:01.900" style="s2">Peter and I question from my own</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.830" end="00:30:05.530" style="s2">personal place most student teachers</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.900" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">college right now and I can&#39;t speak for</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.530" end="00:30:09.820" style="s2">all teachers colleges but I can say is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:11.200" style="s2">very much like a game a world where</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.820" end="00:30:12.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of busy work a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.200" end="00:30:16.210" style="s2">that is really unnecessary to make good</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.910" end="00:30:17.890" style="s2">teachers and they&#39;re holding on to me</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.210" end="00:30:20.590" style="s2">and my friends and other colleges also</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.890" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">I&#39;m in Israel by the way pretty tightly</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.590" end="00:30:26.890" style="s2">giving us a lot of work to do that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:30.669" style="s2">and as this is in some ways a shake up</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.890" end="00:30:32.950" style="s2">period between game a and game B I want</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.669" end="00:30:34.150" style="s2">to know kind of going off about John for</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.950" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">bacon he said about stealing mythical</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.150" end="00:30:38.530" style="s2">journeys a kind of grown in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:42.010" style="s2">is this a time to rebell in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.530" end="00:30:43.799" style="s2">sense where people who are kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.010" end="00:30:46.660" style="s2">this place where they can afford a</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.799" end="00:30:48.460" style="s2">somewhat sacrificing parts of game a and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.660" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">getting the grades or ever would be in</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.460" end="00:30:53.290" style="s2">order to throw themselves at things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:55.720" style="s2">and coronavirus or other projects that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.290" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">are much more game B party ended or do</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.720" end="00:30:59.410" style="s2">you think that that would be a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">by going too early and really part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.410" end="00:31:03.580" style="s2">developing game you require people on</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:04.990" style="s2">top of game a kind of and climbing up</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.580" end="00:31:07.030" style="s2">that ladder it&#39;ll be a better long-term</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.990" end="00:31:09.970" style="s2">investment that&#39;s a damn good question</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.030" end="00:31:13.400" style="s2">tell you the truth let me think about</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.970" end="00:31:16.580" style="s2">that a second before I answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.400" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">okay here&#39;s the answer and it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.580" end="00:31:24.590" style="s2">not a surprise it depends if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">office move to a game be alternative say</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.590" end="00:31:28.910" style="s2">for instance to build a game be venture</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:31.100" style="s2">one of the things I talked about in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.910" end="00:31:33.800" style="s2">journey the game B is the idea of game B</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.100" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">ventures and you know we would expect</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.800" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">them to be operated as coops or</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:41.210" style="s2">community owned or funded in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">non-predatory financial means such as</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.210" end="00:31:47.900" style="s2">good enough rate of return right if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:50.179" style="s2">have such a thing either proximal to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.900" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">or that you could create an Israel you</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.179" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">have the very interesting example of</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:58.100" style="s2">kibbutz which while has its issues also</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:00.860" style="s2">has some great learnings on how to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.100" end="00:32:01.940" style="s2">a I would say a game be proximate style</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.860" end="00:32:05.270" style="s2">of business if you have an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.940" end="00:32:10.910" style="s2">take it but don&#39;t cut your own throat I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.270" end="00:32:12.830" style="s2">think we don&#39;t want game B people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.910" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">are getting ready for game B to bail</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.830" end="00:32:19.460" style="s2">from their game a senators too early so</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:22.400" style="s2">don&#39;t be a fool be wise be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.460" end="00:32:24.110" style="s2">about creating a game B alternative I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.400" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">will say you know my business career was</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.110" end="00:32:30.530" style="s2">mostly being an entrepreneur and helping</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:31.790" style="s2">entrepreneurs and when people came to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.530" end="00:32:32.540" style="s2">with a business plan one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.790" end="00:32:35.570" style="s2">things I say how long you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.540" end="00:32:37.010" style="s2">working on this right and if the answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.570" end="00:32:38.900" style="s2">was two weeks and I&#39;d say once you go</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:40.910" style="s2">back and do some more work I seldom</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.900" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">found a good business idea that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.910" end="00:32:44.929" style="s2">take nine months of study and research</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:47.660" style="s2">and development before I was ready to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.929" end="00:32:52.190" style="s2">launch about the same times it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.660" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">grow a baby so you know move when that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.190" end="00:32:58.280" style="s2">when you have a place to move to but</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">don&#39;t cut your throat in the interim and</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.280" end="00:33:02.300" style="s2">be thinking about the move be organizing</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.520" style="s2">with people to create the move that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.300" end="00:33:06.770" style="s2">want to make does that answer your</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.520" end="00:33:10.850" style="s2">question well yeah I mean the best that</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:05.240" style="s2">is there a role for people who have been</p>

<p begin="00:35:02.510" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">has to be able to create value to sell</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:12.200" style="s2">operating hypothesis and again I&#39;d point</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.170" end="00:35:14.600" style="s2">you to my long essay a journey to game</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.600" end="00:35:19.520" style="s2">some detail it is our working hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.990" end="00:35:21.620" style="s2">that a group of people operating in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.520" end="00:35:25.160" style="s2">honesty and good faith with high</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.160" end="00:35:28.430" style="s2">ought to build a better society in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:29.780" style="s2">place that we&#39;d be proud to live in but</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.430" end="00:35:32.870" style="s2">I&#39;ll be able to compete the hell out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.780" end="00:35:35.060" style="s2">game a in its own game and from the very</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.870" end="00:35:37.850" style="s2">beginning in fact Jordan halls a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:41.170" style="s2">original concept of game a in January</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.850" end="00:35:42.940" style="s2">2013 was that this new way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.170" end="00:35:46.690" style="s2">would not only be a better way of being</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.940" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">but could actively parasitize game a so</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.690" end="00:35:50.890" style="s2">the idea of game B ventures is</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:53.740" style="s2">absolutely critical to this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.890" end="00:35:55.810" style="s2">where you know some founder money could</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.740" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">be useful in the same way that seed</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.810" end="00:36:01.540" style="s2">capital is useful in the game a world so</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.920" style="s2">we could and I should add one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.540" end="00:36:06.220" style="s2">projects that we&#39;re actively working on</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.920" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">in game B is to set up an extended</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.220" end="00:36:12.869" style="s2">crowdfunding platform so that people of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:16.270" style="s2">all levels of capital accumulation can</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.869" end="00:36:19.900" style="s2">invest either on a donation basis or in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.270" end="00:36:22.359" style="s2">a you know non exploitive financed basis</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.900" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">in these early game a game B ventures</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.359" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">however if they&#39;re going to scale the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:29.290" style="s2">game B ventures have to be able to win</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:30.910" style="s2">in game a terms which is seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.290" end="00:36:32.950" style="s2">contradiction right how do you beat game</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.910" end="00:36:35.080" style="s2">a by playing the game of honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.950" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">good faith but I say their answer to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.080" end="00:36:40.180" style="s2">that is by having higher coherence</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:42.490" style="s2">higher sovereignty self-organization and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.180" end="00:36:45.730" style="s2">network centricity built deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.490" end="00:36:48.310" style="s2">your DNA that&#39;s that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.730" end="00:36:49.960" style="s2">Nikolas you had a similar question do</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.310" end="00:36:53.109" style="s2">you want to piggyback on what we just</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.960" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">said sure so we have a startup we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.109" end="00:37:00.940" style="s2">been working on it for five years and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve consciously eschewed traditional</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.940" end="00:37:05.349" style="s2">forms of investment and that&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:07.960" style="s2">very difficult for us so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.349" end="00:37:10.930" style="s2">bootstrapping and we want to get in we</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.960" end="00:37:13.780" style="s2">consider ourselves a game B venture but</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.930" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">we have very few means that our disposal</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.780" end="00:37:22.089" style="s2">so we&#39;ve considered crowdfunding and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:25.510" style="s2">are at a loss as to where to go in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.089" end="00:37:28.330" style="s2">to tap into the supposed impact game B</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.510" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">investor network if there is one I</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.330" end="00:37:32.410" style="s2">thought yeah that&#39;s a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">in the same place you are</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.410" end="00:37:36.670" style="s2">frankly because today there is no such</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.900" end="00:37:38.859" style="s2">mechanism as you have discovered right</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.670" end="00:37:40.450" style="s2">once in a while you find a good hearted</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.859" end="00:37:42.700" style="s2">person who is in your extended social</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.450" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">network and they help you out but</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.700" end="00:37:47.080" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to make your project</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:49.270" style="s2">visible to a lot of people nor is there</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.080" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">a trusted intermediary to aggregate the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.270" end="00:37:54.299" style="s2">funds and we believe that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.599" style="s2">earliest things that game</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.299" end="00:38:00.959" style="s2">NEADS and in fact it is my number one</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.599" end="00:38:04.170" style="s2">game be project that and a honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.959" end="00:38:07.109" style="s2">game be gig economy pool platform those</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.170" end="00:38:08.699" style="s2">are my two short-term goals if we could</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.109" end="00:38:12.839" style="s2">have a gig economy platform that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.699" end="00:38:15.989" style="s2">owned by the by the talent and if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.839" end="00:38:17.459" style="s2">could have a quite sophisticated crowd</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.989" end="00:38:19.049" style="s2">funding that went everywhere from</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.459" end="00:38:21.929" style="s2">donations to the equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.049" end="00:38:24.989" style="s2">securities on a non rapacious financial</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.929" end="00:38:26.969" style="s2">basis and we had you know social</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.989" end="00:38:28.949" style="s2">reputation networks around those to vet</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.969" end="00:38:30.839" style="s2">both ventures and employees I think we</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.949" end="00:38:32.910" style="s2">have three of the most important things</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.839" end="00:38:35.069" style="s2">necessary to do what you&#39;re saying but</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.910" end="00:38:36.569" style="s2">unfortunately they don&#39;t exist today but</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.069" end="00:38:38.459" style="s2">they&#39;re very high on my list of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.569" end="00:38:41.609" style="s2">priorities and on other people&#39;s lists</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.459" end="00:38:43.229" style="s2">the priorities to get done thank you and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.609" end="00:38:45.239" style="s2">by the way if you&#39;d like I&#39;d be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.229" end="00:38:47.219" style="s2">chat with you on a video conference</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.239" end="00:38:48.749" style="s2">which give you whatever thoughts I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.219" end="00:38:50.249" style="s2">that may or may not help but now you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.749" end="00:38:52.499" style="s2">get every be worth every penny you pay</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.249" end="00:38:55.199" style="s2">for it which it&#39;ll be free we love that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.499" end="00:38:58.799" style="s2">thanks Dino you had a question for Jim</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.199" end="00:39:01.979" style="s2">hi Jim hey everyone yeah this is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.799" end="00:39:05.130" style="s2">little bit metaphysical maybe but I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.979" end="00:39:07.529" style="s2">listening a lot to your show a lot from</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.130" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">Daniel and Jordan and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.529" end="00:39:14.609" style="s2">framing around how we make better sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:16.650" style="s2">of plan plan a to then step into plan B</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.609" end="00:39:20.959" style="s2">and a little bit around the framework</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.650" end="00:39:24.269" style="s2">and maybe logical steps we can take to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.959" end="00:39:26.069" style="s2">action it and then I got listening to</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.269" end="00:39:28.199" style="s2">Nora Bateson and a more feminine</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.069" end="00:39:29.719" style="s2">approach to it and she was basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.199" end="00:39:33.809" style="s2">saying we can&#39;t really make a logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.719" end="00:39:37.170" style="s2">step two step framework for Plan B but</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.809" end="00:39:40.019" style="s2">more so meet complexity with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.170" end="00:39:43.799" style="s2">and even though that&#39;s very metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.019" end="00:39:45.719" style="s2">I thought what what is your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.799" end="00:39:47.640" style="s2">around that because I&#39;m not something a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.719" end="00:39:50.609" style="s2">lot of masculine lot of men in this</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.640" end="00:39:52.759" style="s2">space but these are complex times and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.609" end="00:39:55.949" style="s2">noticed the intuition of a woman and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.759" end="00:39:59.099" style="s2">translating that into a maybe actionable</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.949" end="00:40:00.900" style="s2">process is important I was just wanting</p>
