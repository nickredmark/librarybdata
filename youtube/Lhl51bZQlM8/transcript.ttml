<p begin="00:01:05.590" end="00:01:11.710" style="s2">talked about the kind of God that the</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.430" end="00:01:31.450" style="s2">we talked about the sense of faith as</p>

<p begin="00:01:48.430" end="00:01:53.560" style="s2">on course and we talked about how the</p>

<p begin="00:01:53.560" end="00:01:59.799" style="s2">represent increasingly that vision that</p>

<p begin="00:02:43.550" end="00:02:48.110" style="s2">associated his school with things like</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.110" end="00:02:54.500" style="s2">we can enhance our capacity to pick up</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.140" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">insight and faculties we can transform</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.049" end="00:03:12.290" style="s2">ourselves and Pythagoras changes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">shamanic soul flight into a release a</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.810" end="00:03:47.600" style="s2">the axial revolution in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:48.980" style="s2">is the figure of Socrates Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.600" end="00:03:52.100" style="s2">Pythagoras are going to be the two most</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.980" end="00:03:54.739" style="s2">important influences on Plato and if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.100" end="00:03:58.370" style="s2">were to put Western civilization on to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.739" end="00:04:03.440" style="s2">two feet the one foot is the Bible the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.370" end="00:04:06.920" style="s2">other foot is the works of Plato so</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">Socrates is a very unusual figure there</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.920" end="00:04:12.130" style="s2">are as many interpretation of Socrates&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:15.260" style="s2">as there are of people like the Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.130" end="00:04:17.810" style="s2">even in his time there were many</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.260" end="00:04:20.090" style="s2">differents Socratic movements groups of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.810" end="00:04:23.289" style="s2">people who claim to be adherents and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.090" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">disciples of Socrates he is an enigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.289" end="00:04:28.940" style="s2">interesting provocative and maddeningly</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:31.490" style="s2">frustrating figure to try and get clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.940" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">on so I want it understood that when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.490" end="00:04:35.930" style="s2">talking about Socrates I&#39;m talking in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:37.550" style="s2">about a particular interpretation that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.930" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">share with other people I think it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.550" end="00:04:42.800" style="s2">be well argued for</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:46.760" style="s2">as I said whether or not this was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.800" end="00:04:49.130" style="s2">full historical Socrates it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.760" end="00:04:50.900" style="s2">to know and in some sense this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.130" end="00:04:52.820" style="s2">that relevant because it&#39;s the Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:55.310" style="s2">I&#39;m going to talk about that has become</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.820" end="00:05:01.310" style="s2">part of the cognitive and existential</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.310" end="00:05:02.690" style="s2">grammar of the West so getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.310" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">figure of Socrates is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.690" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">interesting a good way to start is to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:16.370" style="s2">see how how provocative a person he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:21.170" style="s2">is to do his biography so as many of you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.370" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">probably know ancient Greece was a world</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.170" end="00:05:24.740" style="s2">in which people believed they could</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:29.210" style="s2">speak to the God through Oracle&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.740" end="00:05:32.270" style="s2">Oracles were human or or otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.210" end="00:05:35.180" style="s2">natural phenomena that represented how</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.270" end="00:05:36.860" style="s2">the gods were speaking to humanity one</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.180" end="00:05:38.960" style="s2">of the most important Oracle&#39;s is at</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.860" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">Delphi and I&#39;ve been to Delphi if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.960" end="00:05:44.030" style="s2">get a chance at some point in your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:46.490" style="s2">go to Delphi it will really put this app</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.030" end="00:05:49.700" style="s2">on your brain because the way the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.490" end="00:05:51.620" style="s2">landscape is organized really does have</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.700" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">a transformative impact on sort of your</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.620" end="00:05:54.770" style="s2">consciousness and your sense of self and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:59.030" style="s2">your sense of place in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.770" end="00:06:01.040" style="s2">so the situation that the Wright the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.030" end="00:06:03.020" style="s2">site of Delphi is itself very</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.040" end="00:06:06.290" style="s2">transformative what would happen is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.020" end="00:06:08.570" style="s2">woman Pythia would sit in a cave or</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.290" end="00:06:10.940" style="s2">something similar to it again became</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.570" end="00:06:11.750" style="s2">always the caves like the association</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:13.340" style="s2">with shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.750" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">remember that shamanism was associated</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:19.190" style="s2">with cave art ritual practices taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:21.260" style="s2">place in caves like in Pythagoras so</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.190" end="00:06:24.050" style="s2">she&#39;s in a cave she&#39;s sitting on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.260" end="00:06:26.870" style="s2">tripod there might be some intoxicating</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.050" end="00:06:30.229" style="s2">gases in there she&#39;s eating perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.870" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">eucalyptus leaves she&#39;s probably going</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.229" end="00:06:36.530" style="s2">into some kind of psychedelic trance</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:38.090" style="s2">state that seems plausible and then what</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.530" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">happens is people would because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.090" end="00:06:42.169" style="s2">that&#39;s that is a cross-cultural thing we</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:43.970" style="s2">find that people are thought to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.169" end="00:06:45.200" style="s2">access to the gods by being able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:47.510" style="s2">enter into altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.200" end="00:06:48.770" style="s2">consciousness so what would happen is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.510" end="00:06:50.330" style="s2">people would come in they would bring</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.770" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">their questions they would pose</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.330" end="00:06:56.300" style="s2">questions to Pythia she would then</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:59.800" style="s2">speak on behalf of the gods and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.300" end="00:07:02.510" style="s2">after speaking on behalf of the gods the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.800" end="00:07:04.280" style="s2">people around her would there would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.510" end="00:07:10.250" style="s2">males who would interpret what she had</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.280" end="00:07:11.690" style="s2">to say so the thing about being an</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.250" end="00:07:12.860" style="s2">Oracle is if you want to stay in</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.400" end="00:08:57.260" style="s2">pose their question and the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.440" end="00:09:02.210" style="s2">they pose is there any one wiser than</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.850" end="00:09:33.579" style="s2">than socrates crystal-clear answer and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.760" end="00:09:33.579" style="s2">so you can imagine how shocked they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.570" end="00:09:42.019" style="s2">so they travel back of course to relate</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.820" end="00:09:43.970" style="s2">this story to Socrates and here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.899" end="00:10:11.089" style="s2">is also profound interesting so if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.990" end="00:10:19.430" style="s2">very wise most of us would be very self</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.430" end="00:10:24.350" style="s2">and how do I know that because one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:26.149" style="s2">the most persistent biases have is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.350" end="00:10:27.800" style="s2">people believe they&#39;re above average</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.149" end="00:10:30.110" style="s2">intelligence and of course most people</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.800" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">must be wrong about that because most</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.110" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">people have well average intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.120" end="00:10:35.690" style="s2">but if you ask anybody is your</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:37.240" style="s2">intelligence average they will tell you</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.690" end="00:10:40.390" style="s2">know I have above-average intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.240" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">more so of course even for ideas such as</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.390" end="00:10:47.209" style="s2">wisdom but Socrates isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">self-congratulatory he doesn&#39;t say yep I</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.209" end="00:10:51.140" style="s2">knew it all along</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">there&#39;s the confirmation I so want now</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.140" end="00:10:56.029" style="s2">that&#39;s really telling enough itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:57.829" style="s2">because to quote a friend of mine Leo</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">self-knowledge was central and the this</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.900" end="00:15:40.550" style="s2">is the core of the axial revolution the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:43.889" style="s2">axial revolution is this critical</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.550" end="00:15:49.709" style="s2">awareness and sense of responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.889" end="00:15:53.009" style="s2">zone cognition so on one hand the gods</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.709" end="00:15:54.660" style="s2">can&#39;t lie when they say Socrates as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.009" end="00:15:57.299" style="s2">wisest human being but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.660" end="00:15:59.670" style="s2">Socrates has deep self knowledge he has</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.299" end="00:16:07.919" style="s2">Socratic self-knowledge in which he is</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.670" end="00:16:10.169" style="s2">convinced that he is not wise and he is</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.919" end="00:16:11.609" style="s2">not willing to give up on either one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.169" end="00:16:13.049" style="s2">those and that&#39;s a telling thing about</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.609" end="00:16:14.819" style="s2">him that tells you something very</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.049" end="00:16:18.119" style="s2">central about him he holds these two</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.819" end="00:16:22.290" style="s2">together his existential self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.119" end="00:16:24.299" style="s2">and this disclosure from reality are</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.299" end="00:16:29.220" style="s2">given a greater Authority they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.699" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">to be held together so now Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.220" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">faces a personal dilemma a dilemma that</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:37.709" style="s2">goes to the core of who and what he is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:40.410" style="s2">how can it be that he is the wisest</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.709" end="00:16:46.379" style="s2">human being when he knows that he is not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.410" end="00:16:48.029" style="s2">wise so this is a very deep dilemma that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.379" end="00:16:50.429" style="s2">he set for himself it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.029" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">profound problem that he seeks to solve</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.429" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">and what that means is that Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:59.790" style="s2">starts on a quest he starts on a quest</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.850" end="00:17:01.439" style="s2">of trying to determine how both of those</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.790" end="00:17:07.110" style="s2">things could be the case at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.439" end="00:17:10.429" style="s2">time now the quest seems to have evolved</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.110" end="00:17:12.990" style="s2">very naturally into a way in which he</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.429" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">interacted with those around him what</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.990" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">Socrates would do is he would go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:21.659" style="s2">people who claimed or would credited</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.909" style="s2">with being wise and he would ask them</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.659" end="00:17:26.159" style="s2">question he invented in fact what has</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.909" end="00:17:29.130" style="s2">become known as the Socratic method also</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.159" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">known as of Linkous the Socratic method</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.130" end="00:17:36.750" style="s2">is a way of asking questions in order to</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:38.909" style="s2">try and draw somebody out we&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.750" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">little bit more about in Linkous in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.909" end="00:17:43.110" style="s2">minute but first I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:45.330" style="s2">the two types of people that we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.110" end="00:17:47.450" style="s2">good reason to believe Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.330" end="00:17:51.409" style="s2">interacting and what that can tell us</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.450" end="00:17:53.639" style="s2">about the Socratic notion of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.409" end="00:17:56.429" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see how the Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.639" end="00:17:57.880" style="s2">notion of wisdom knowledge and this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.429" end="00:18:00.010" style="s2">of self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.880" end="00:18:05.980" style="s2">is deeply bound up with how meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.010" end="00:18:07.900" style="s2">your life is so the two groups that</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.980" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">Socrates the two groups of people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.900" end="00:18:18.010" style="s2">were accredited as being wise were the</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:20.220" style="s2">philosophers and the sophist if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.010" end="00:18:23.080" style="s2">remember last time we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.220" end="00:18:27.040" style="s2">pythagoras pythagoras actually invents</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.080" end="00:18:35.170" style="s2">the word philosophy it comes from two</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.040" end="00:18:38.620" style="s2">greek words by lia sophia this means</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.170" end="00:18:42.850" style="s2">right the the friendship love of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.620" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">so and Pythagoras creates a community</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.850" end="00:18:46.690" style="s2">around him you create a community</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:49.270" style="s2">distributed cognition in which you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.690" end="00:18:52.510" style="s2">interact with other people in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.270" end="00:18:55.750" style="s2">try and pursue wisdom a philosopher is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.510" end="00:19:00.460" style="s2">someone who in concert with others is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.750" end="00:19:03.880" style="s2">lover of wisdom so Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:07.020" style="s2">interacting with the philosophers and in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.880" end="00:19:11.260" style="s2">particular one group of philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.020" end="00:19:13.510" style="s2">that come before him in fact Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.260" end="00:19:15.730" style="s2">regarded as creating a revolution in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.510" end="00:19:19.590" style="s2">philosophy precisely from how he</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:19.590" style="s2">differed from the natural philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.660" end="00:19:27.250" style="s2">and he is also doing the Socratic method</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.510" end="00:19:30.520" style="s2">with the sophist and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.250" end="00:19:32.440" style="s2">this also comes from Sophia wisdom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.520" end="00:19:35.260" style="s2">where we get our word sophisticated from</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.440" end="00:19:38.830" style="s2">the Sophists are also people who claim</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.260" end="00:19:40.510" style="s2">to be wise now the natural philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.830" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">are very interesting the natural</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.510" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">philosophers seem to represent a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">fundamental change in human cognition so</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:51.310" style="s2">I&#39;m going to take as an example one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:55.060" style="s2">the natural philosophers who is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.310" end="00:20:00.390" style="s2">considered to be the first example of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.060" end="00:20:02.710" style="s2">bailey&#39;s now because these guys are just</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.390" end="00:20:05.500" style="s2">as we&#39;re coming out of the dark age and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.710" end="00:20:08.410" style="s2">they predate Socrates sometimes by a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.500" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">hundred a couple hundred years right or</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.410" end="00:20:11.500" style="s2">their boats a lot of what we have from</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:14.790" style="s2">them is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.500" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">very fragmentary we don&#39;t have very much</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.790" end="00:20:22.120" style="s2">in fact you can put most of Bailey&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:24.370" style="s2">philosophy into three lines into three</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.120" end="00:20:25.720" style="s2">sentences I once taught this to a course</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.370" end="00:20:27.370" style="s2">of mine and one of my students went out</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.720" end="00:20:29.560" style="s2">and made a t-shirt in which they put all</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.370" end="00:20:31.480" style="s2">of the Lee&#39;s philosophy on one t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.560" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">because we that&#39;s how fragmentary it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.480" end="00:20:34.900" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about these three fragments</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:41.830" style="s2">because they reveal something very</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.900" end="00:20:48.100" style="s2">important one is all is the moist the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.830" end="00:20:51.580" style="s2">next is the lodestone as sue K and this</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.100" end="00:20:53.410" style="s2">is important because this word sue K</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.580" end="00:20:54.910" style="s2">which we now pronounce psyche is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.410" end="00:20:57.940" style="s2">to be the basis of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.910" end="00:20:59.890" style="s2">psychology as a discipline and finally</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.890" end="00:21:06.090" style="s2">sounds very pre-action monic</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:16.669" style="s2">now what you have to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.100" end="00:21:19.730" style="s2">here is not what the LEAs is saying but</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.669" end="00:21:21.559" style="s2">what that what he says reveals about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.730" end="00:21:25.730" style="s2">kind of thinking he is creating what</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.559" end="00:21:27.110" style="s2">does he mean by this all is the moist of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.730" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">course there&#39;s controversy about all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.110" end="00:21:32.210" style="s2">this because it&#39;s fragmentary it&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:33.919" style="s2">but given how other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.210" end="00:21:35.809" style="s2">ancient world like Aristotle followed up</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.919" end="00:21:37.899" style="s2">on this a plausible interpretation is</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.020" end="00:27:18.420" style="s2">I mean here is seeing with the mind into</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.020" end="00:27:39.570" style="s2">into right here right now think about</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.930" end="00:27:43.530" style="s2">how powerful that way must be think of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.570" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">the power in that vision he gets an</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:54.270" style="s2">is he saying that provokes ah that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:59.160" style="s2">provokes wonder that gives him a sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.270" end="00:28:01.890" style="s2">of connecting to what is most real it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.160" end="00:28:05.580" style="s2">helps him to make the most sense of</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.030" end="00:28:14.780" style="s2">is powerful stuff</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.730" end="00:33:25.990" style="s2">now the Sophists were only concerned</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.990" end="00:33:32.740" style="s2">separated the technology from any kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.870" end="00:33:34.780" style="s2">of moral commitment so for example a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.740" end="00:33:38.260" style="s2">particular sophist might go in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.780" end="00:33:40.900" style="s2">morning to this aristocrat and help him</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:43.270" style="s2">argue for why Athens should increase the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.900" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">number of ships in its Navy and in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.270" end="00:33:47.890" style="s2">afternoon go to this aristocrat and help</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:49.630" style="s2">him craft an argument as to why often</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.890" end="00:33:53.230" style="s2">should decrease the number of ships in</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.630" end="00:33:55.870" style="s2">the Navy the sophist didn&#39;t care which</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.230" end="00:33:57.940" style="s2">was the case what mattered was</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.870" end="00:34:01.960" style="s2">empowering the individual to win the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.940" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">argument now how does this work and how</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.960" end="00:34:10.090" style="s2">can we relate it to our to our lives now</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:13.390" style="s2">so basically a good way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.090" end="00:34:15.909" style="s2">this is the sophist pick up on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.390" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">that when we are communicating we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.909" end="00:34:20.919" style="s2">going to talk about this a lot later as</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:23.830" style="s2">we go on we are being driven by what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.919" end="00:34:26.520" style="s2">find salient and relevant not just what</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.830" end="00:34:29.860" style="s2">we find true or believed to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.520" end="00:34:33.149" style="s2">remember with the nine dart problem what</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.860" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">stands out to us what&#39;s relevant shapes</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.149" end="00:34:43.179" style="s2">how we see things and how we understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:45.909" style="s2">them so let me give you a modern analog</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.179" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">for what how rhetoric works a place</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.909" end="00:34:54.679" style="s2">where rhetoric is readily apparent</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:57.260" style="s2">advertising okay see the point about</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.679" end="00:34:59.480" style="s2">advertisement is to make use of the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.260" end="00:35:01.130" style="s2">your brain will associate things the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.480" end="00:35:03.620" style="s2">your brain finds certain things salient</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.130" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">make things seem highly relevant to you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.620" end="00:35:09.650" style="s2">in order to manipulate your behavior now</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:12.610" style="s2">what&#39;s telling about this and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.650" end="00:35:16.670" style="s2">the point about the sophist is how much</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.610" end="00:35:18.380" style="s2">that can happen right in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.670" end="00:35:22.010" style="s2">disconnected from whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.380" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">true I mean you watch the beer</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.010" end="00:35:28.730" style="s2">commercial and here it is here&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:30.350" style="s2">attractive people and they all get</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.350" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">time and it&#39;s this beer and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.630" end="00:35:39.440" style="s2">beautiful attractive people go into an</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:40.720" style="s2">actual bar that&#39;s not like that okay and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.440" end="00:35:45.190" style="s2">you know you&#39;re not going to see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.720" end="00:35:47.480" style="s2">kind of broken-down lives drunk people</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.190" end="00:35:49.550" style="s2">now here&#39;s the thing you know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.480" end="00:35:51.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not true you know that you like</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.550" end="00:35:53.180" style="s2">if you like if you went into a bar and</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.180" end="00:35:57.620" style="s2">happening if when you wash your hair</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:35:59.330" style="s2">with shampoo you were suddenly in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.620" end="00:36:02.210" style="s2">shampoo commercial you&#39;d worry about</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.330" end="00:36:04.940" style="s2">your sanity you know it&#39;s not true it</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.210" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter it makes certain stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.940" end="00:36:11.300" style="s2">salient to you and so you buy the beer</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">you buy the shampoo this is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.300" end="00:36:18.620" style="s2">when I say your beliefs aren&#39;t the only</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.310" end="00:36:58.490" style="s2">about pure cases how does the liar work</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.960" end="00:38:33.109" style="s2">the example is a political example there</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.550" end="00:38:37.160" style="s2">are two aliens running for political</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.160" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">Americans right and I mean no insult to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.750" end="00:38:48.290" style="s2">Americans but I mean I think we&#39;re aware</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:49.700" style="s2">of how what I&#39;m going to say is relevant</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.290" end="00:38:52.490" style="s2">to American politics right now and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.700" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">speech goes something like this one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.490" end="00:38:57.980" style="s2">the aliens named Kang says my fellow</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:39:01.670" style="s2">Americans when I was young I dreamt of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.980" end="00:39:05.180" style="s2">being a baseball but now we must move</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.670" end="00:39:07.490" style="s2">forward not backwards upwards twirling</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.180" end="00:39:07.940" style="s2">twirling towards freedom and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.490" end="00:39:09.800" style="s2">Cheers</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.940" end="00:39:15.650" style="s2">no it&#39;s meaningless it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.800" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">anything but he invokes youth baseball</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.650" end="00:39:20.990" style="s2">moving forward moving upward twirling</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:25.910" style="s2">and freedom and so if you&#39;re an American</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.990" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">you get this rush you get this rush that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.910" end="00:39:30.890" style="s2">rush is these are all salient things</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">they&#39;re highly relevant to you you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.890" end="00:39:35.030" style="s2">associate and identify with them and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:40.670" style="s2">you&#39;re swept up you&#39;re caught up in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.030" end="00:39:42.890" style="s2">now why does matter well part</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.670" end="00:39:45.080" style="s2">as I said at the beginning part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.890" end="00:39:47.150" style="s2">way people articulate the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.080" end="00:39:49.820" style="s2">is there&#39;s so much and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.150" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">to be increasing we are separating</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.820" end="00:39:58.370" style="s2">relevance and salience from truth but</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:00.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper reason and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.370" end="00:40:03.050" style="s2">is part of why it matters to Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.350" end="00:40:05.480" style="s2">look you can&#39;t although we use this</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.050" end="00:40:07.790" style="s2">metaphor for self-deception it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.480" end="00:40:11.380" style="s2">actually not a good metaphor you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.790" end="00:40:13.490" style="s2">lie to yourself it makes no sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.380" end="00:40:14.600" style="s2">cognitive psychologists have been</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.490" end="00:40:18.620" style="s2">pointing that in philosophers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.600" end="00:40:21.650" style="s2">pointing this out you can&#39;t no not Pete</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.620" end="00:40:25.790" style="s2">and then say to yourself but P but P the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.650" end="00:40:27.710" style="s2">trouble is you know that this is not the</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.790" end="00:40:28.310" style="s2">case and so simply stating this to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.710" end="00:40:30.890" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.310" end="00:40:33.110" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do anything you can&#39;t lie to</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.890" end="00:40:35.110" style="s2">yourself because you&#39;re in possession of</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.110" end="00:40:36.800" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.110" end="00:40:38.870" style="s2">did I just prove to you that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.800" end="00:40:41.780" style="s2">self-deception is impossible no not at</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.870" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">all see you can&#39;t lie to yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.780" end="00:40:48.650" style="s2">here&#39;s what I would argue you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2"> yourself why because lying has</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.650" end="00:40:54.410" style="s2">to do with believing I&#39;m gonna come back</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:59.690" style="s2">to this again and again look believing</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.410" end="00:41:02.570" style="s2">isn&#39;t something you directly do here</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.690" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">I&#39;ll show you pick a belief you would</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.570" end="00:41:07.790" style="s2">like to have I would like to have the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:09.860" style="s2">belief that everybody loves me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.790" end="00:41:12.920" style="s2">believe that but I would like to truly</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.860" end="00:41:16.820" style="s2">have that belief so what should I do</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.920" end="00:41:19.160" style="s2">I should just believe believe you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.820" end="00:41:23.180" style="s2">televangelists doing this telling people</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.160" end="00:41:26.300" style="s2">believe but you can&#39;t you can hope that</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.180" end="00:41:28.760" style="s2">everybody loves you you can wish that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.300" end="00:41:29.460" style="s2">everybody loves you but if I say believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.760" end="00:41:31.830" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.460" end="00:41:35.850" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it that somehow belief</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.830" end="00:41:40.140" style="s2">works it&#39;s not a voluntary action you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.850" end="00:41:41.970" style="s2">can&#39;t lie to yourself see self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.140" end="00:41:44.280" style="s2">works in a different way you know what</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.970" end="00:41:45.990" style="s2">you can do you can yourself how</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.280" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">can you yourself because what</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.990" end="00:41:51.810" style="s2">you can do is direct your attention if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:54.210" style="s2">say pay attention to this finger you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.810" end="00:41:56.190" style="s2">and you can also choose to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.210" end="00:41:57.210" style="s2">to something now attention and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.190" end="00:41:59.790" style="s2">talk about this later</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.210" end="00:42:03.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s how central it is there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.790" end="00:42:06.690" style="s2">sides to attention you can direct your</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.540" end="00:42:08.730" style="s2">attention for example if I say your left</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.690" end="00:42:10.320" style="s2">big toe you&#39;re paying attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.730" end="00:42:13.170" style="s2">and suddenly it&#39;s salient to you when</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.320" end="00:42:15.150" style="s2">you pay attention to something it makes</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.170" end="00:42:19.500" style="s2">it more salient it stands out for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.150" end="00:42:22.050" style="s2">but you know what else attention can</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.500" end="00:42:24.510" style="s2">also be direct not only be directed by</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.050" end="00:42:27.120" style="s2">you to make things more salient your</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.510" end="00:42:30.870" style="s2">attention can be caught a sudden noise</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.120" end="00:42:32.430" style="s2">and you turn and you attend to it it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.870" end="00:42:34.770" style="s2">salient and it captures your attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.430" end="00:42:37.110" style="s2">so not only can you direct your</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.770" end="00:42:41.640" style="s2">attention your attention can be captured</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.110" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">by what you find salient and notice what</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:46.620" style="s2">this means you can do you can direct</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:48.210" style="s2">your attention to something and make it</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.620" end="00:42:52.290" style="s2">more salient and because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.210" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">salient it will tend to capture your</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.290" end="00:42:55.320" style="s2">attention and because you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:56.910" style="s2">attention to it you make it more salient</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.320" end="00:42:58.260" style="s2">which means it will more likely capture</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.910" end="00:43:00.900" style="s2">your attention do you see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.260" end="00:43:05.100" style="s2">happening here these two things feed on</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.900" end="00:43:06.630" style="s2">each other I pay more attention to it it</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.100" end="00:43:08.700" style="s2">becomes more salient it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.630" end="00:43:09.570" style="s2">salient it gathers my attention I pay</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.700" end="00:43:11.790" style="s2">more attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.570" end="00:43:13.590" style="s2">I&#39;m more likely to be attracted to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.790" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">and it spins on itself in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.590" end="00:43:20.550" style="s2">self-organizing manner until your</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">attention is attached to something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.550" end="00:43:25.170" style="s2">super salient to you it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:29.460" style="s2">relevant to you and you lose the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.170" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">capacity to notice other things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.460" end="00:43:35.660" style="s2">how you yourself the salience</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:38.040" style="s2">and the catchiness of the stimulus has</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.660" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">overtaken any concern you have for</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.040" end="00:43:42.620" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:48.170" style="s2">or represents reality this is how you</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.620" end="00:43:49.940" style="s2">deceive yourself so do you see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.170" end="00:43:57.050" style="s2">why Socrates is going to be so</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.940" end="00:44:02.300" style="s2">antagonistic towards the sophist they</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.050" end="00:44:05.720" style="s2">are the opposite the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.300" end="00:44:09.050" style="s2">axial revolution they are the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.720" end="00:44:10.970" style="s2">of that rational self-knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.050" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">attempt to overcome self-deception the</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.970" end="00:44:15.320" style="s2">sophist are promoting and when</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">you promote you not only</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.320" end="00:44:19.510" style="s2">promote the deception of others you make</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:22.100" style="s2">yourself more vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.510" end="00:44:30.500" style="s2">self-deception you fall more and more</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.100" end="00:44:34.600" style="s2">prey to self-deception so the natural</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.500" end="00:44:34.600" style="s2">philosophers are truth without relevance</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:42.620" style="s2">the sophist and the propensity for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.700" end="00:44:47.900" style="s2">promotion of represent</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.620" end="00:44:49.250" style="s2">relevance disconnected from truth so</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.900" end="00:44:53.780" style="s2">notice here they have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.250" end="00:44:55.490" style="s2">transform people but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.780" end="00:44:58.900" style="s2">disconnected it from the pursuit of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.490" end="00:45:02.450" style="s2">truth these people can give us knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.900" end="00:45:06.680" style="s2">of the facts but do not facilitate self</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.450" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">transformation what Socrates wanted is</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.680" end="00:45:18.140" style="s2">he wanted both he wanted individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:20.750" style="s2">knew how to pay attention in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.140" end="00:45:22.910" style="s2">that what they found salient helped them</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.750" end="00:45:25.790" style="s2">determine the truth and that the truth</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.910" end="00:45:28.970" style="s2">that they found help them to train their</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.790" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">attention to find salience Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.970" end="00:45:35.360" style="s2">wanted something like that so what do</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:39.670" style="s2">you would do is he would go about</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.360" end="00:45:42.590" style="s2">questioning people maddening frustration</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.670" end="00:45:45.290" style="s2">so Socrates would come up to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.590" end="00:45:47.990" style="s2">and say well what are you doing here and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.290" end="00:45:49.580" style="s2">oh I&#39;m in the marketplace well why are</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.990" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">you in the marketplace well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.580" end="00:45:52.970" style="s2">purchasing something well why are you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:53.780" style="s2">purchasing something well I want to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.970" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">these goods</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.780" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">why do you want these goods because</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:00.620" style="s2">they&#39;ll make me happy and nad then</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:04.130" style="s2">Socrates starts to oh so you must know</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.670" end="00:46:12.320" style="s2">possible Socrates with us to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.470" end="00:46:13.850" style="s2">pleasure and still find yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.320" end="00:46:15.260" style="s2">horrible situation that you really</p>

<p begin="00:46:23.570" end="00:46:29.420" style="s2">would say what is happiness oh it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.900" end="00:46:31.580" style="s2">know it&#39;s getting what&#39;s most important</p>

<p begin="00:46:33.830" end="00:46:37.820" style="s2">knowledge well no it&#39;s the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.930" end="00:46:39.560" style="s2">what it what&#39;s important what&#39;s truly</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.820" end="00:46:41.750" style="s2">important or what you only think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.560" end="00:46:42.410" style="s2">important I guess what&#39;s truly important</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.080" end="00:46:52.370" style="s2">so in order to be happiness to find</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:54.860" style="s2">happiness you must have first cultivated</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.370" end="00:47:27.950" style="s2">Socrates is just a skeptic he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.840" end="00:47:30.110" style="s2">to show people that they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.950" end="00:47:32.060" style="s2">anything because he wants to show that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.110" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">the gods are right that nobody has any</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.060" end="00:47:36.560" style="s2">wisdom etc that&#39;s too simple I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:40.430" style="s2">something more sophisticated is going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.560" end="00:47:43.940" style="s2">with Socrates Socrates right Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.430" end="00:47:46.100" style="s2">trying to get you to realize he&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:48:34.770" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">does is that provokes a reaction in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.359" end="00:48:41.550" style="s2">people it goes one of two ways people</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.150" end="00:48:43.320" style="s2">either go ah and they don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.550" end="00:48:49.560" style="s2">showing that about themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.320" end="00:48:54.680" style="s2">become angry at Socrates or some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.560" end="00:48:58.410" style="s2">have an insight they realize oh oh I</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.680" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2">need to transform myself I need to find</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.410" end="00:49:02.340" style="s2">a way to keep relevance and truth</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.340" end="00:49:08.940" style="s2">enabling each other and when Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.050" end="00:49:11.609" style="s2">realized that he was having this effect</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.940" end="00:49:12.119" style="s2">on people he had his answer to his</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.119" end="00:49:18.390" style="s2">he knew how it was that the gods were</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.790" end="00:49:22.230" style="s2">not lying and he was the wisest of human</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.390" end="00:49:27.420" style="s2">beings his answer was the following he</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.230" end="00:49:29.400" style="s2">knew what he did not know and we all say</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.420" end="00:49:32.450" style="s2">I know what I don&#39;t know I made note of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.400" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">a lot of it no no no he knew in a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.450" end="00:49:37.830" style="s2">that allows you to directly painfully</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:40.250" style="s2">confront your capacity for in</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.680" end="00:49:45.810" style="s2">to really realize what you do not know</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.990" end="00:49:48.450" style="s2">is to realize I am pursuing her and I</p>

<p begin="00:49:58.070" end="00:50:03.450" style="s2">now many people think that Socrates dis</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.560" end="00:50:05.100" style="s2">concluded that that&#39;s it he didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.450" end="00:50:07.110" style="s2">anything no that&#39;s not what Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.100" end="00:50:11.700" style="s2">talking about Socrates does claim to</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.110" end="00:50:16.530" style="s2">know things you can imagine how Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.700" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">pisses people off so he is put on trial</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.530" end="00:50:21.270" style="s2">in ancient Athens there isn&#39;t a state</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:22.650" style="s2">that arrests you one one citizen accuses</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.270" end="00:50:24.210" style="s2">another you brought on trial you&#39;re put</p>

<p begin="00:50:35.700" end="00:50:41.850" style="s2">they the jury votes on it so Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.780" end="00:50:44.010" style="s2">was accused by people that he pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.850" end="00:50:45.390" style="s2">of atheism which doesn&#39;t mean not</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.010" end="00:50:47.220" style="s2">believing in God&#39;s it just means</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.390" end="00:50:50.070" style="s2">teaching strange gods because as I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.220" end="00:50:55.830" style="s2">mentioned he was concerned to make the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.070" end="00:50:59.250" style="s2">gods moral exemplars now when Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.830" end="00:51:01.260" style="s2">is on trial it becomes clear that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.250" end="00:51:03.000" style="s2">will let him go if he sort of agrees to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.260" end="00:51:04.980" style="s2">stop doing this philosophy stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.000" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">he&#39;s doing stops pissing people off and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.980" end="00:51:10.170" style="s2">then he utters something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:12.180" style="s2">famous and this is a statement of him</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.170" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">deeply knowing something he says the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.180" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living a</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.020" end="00:52:01.800" style="s2">this later because it comes from erotic</p>

<p begin="00:53:32.099" end="00:53:38.460" style="s2">as antithetical to each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.770" end="00:53:40.619" style="s2">for Socrates separating them which our</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.460" end="00:53:42.390" style="s2">culture regularly and reliably does is</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.619" end="00:53:45.030" style="s2">one of our greatest follies</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.390" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">they need to be interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.030" end="00:53:49.770" style="s2">intertwined with each other we need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:52.040" style="s2">rationally know what we should most care</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.770" end="00:53:52.040" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.500" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">so Socrates just put on trial he&#39;s found</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.849" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">guilty he just narrowly loses</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:13.420" style="s2">so then after losing and it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.530" end="00:54:14.950" style="s2">part of the reasons were political and</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.420" end="00:54:17.380" style="s2">part of them he&#39;s pissed off the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.950" end="00:54:19.060" style="s2">powerful and all kinds of things he</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.380" end="00:54:24.369" style="s2">associated with people that turned out</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.060" end="00:54:26.050" style="s2">to be corrupt but he loses by very</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.369" end="00:54:29.349" style="s2">narrow margin and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.050" end="00:54:31.780" style="s2">each side proposes a penalty the accuser</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.349" end="00:54:35.050" style="s2">has proposed death that Socrates should</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.780" end="00:54:36.970" style="s2">be killed and then this tells you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.050" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">something about Socrates Socrates says</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.970" end="00:54:43.270" style="s2">the following practicing philosophy has</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:45.790" style="s2">cost me I have to constantly work at it</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.270" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s very demanding I&#39;m not right</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.790" end="00:54:52.060" style="s2">wealthy I am dependent on other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:54.220" style="s2">people attack me it&#39;s been very risky</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.060" end="00:54:56.859" style="s2">the worst penalty could be for me to</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.220" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">continue doing philosophy and in order</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.859" end="00:55:00.579" style="s2">to make that even worse the government</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">should give me free housing and free</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.579" end="00:55:06.130" style="s2">food for the rest of my life so as you</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:10.060" style="s2">can imagine this pisses everybody off</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.130" end="00:55:12.609" style="s2">and Socrates is found in a much greater</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.060" end="00:55:16.300" style="s2">vote he&#39;s condemned to death now notice</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.609" end="00:55:18.280" style="s2">Socrates is so convinced that he has the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.300" end="00:55:20.440" style="s2">right kind of know thyself not</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.280" end="00:55:24.250" style="s2">autobiographical but this that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.440" end="00:55:27.010" style="s2">talking about he knows how he works and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.250" end="00:55:30.880" style="s2">how to train it to transform it so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.010" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">he cares well and reduces his capacity</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:35.890" style="s2">for self-deception that he&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:38.260" style="s2">die for it he finds that meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.890" end="00:55:40.810" style="s2">important that he&#39;s willing to die for</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.260" end="00:55:43.810" style="s2">it now he&#39;s a very interesting figure</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.810" end="00:55:44.859" style="s2">for that reason but there&#39;s also other</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.810" end="00:55:47.349" style="s2">important things we should know about</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.859" end="00:55:49.329" style="s2">Socrates this the shamanic is still in</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.349" end="00:55:51.250" style="s2">Socrates because he could do the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.329" end="00:55:55.599" style="s2">following he could stand in one place</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.250" end="00:55:57.150" style="s2">for 24 or even 48 hours meditating on</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.599" end="00:55:59.849" style="s2">his own thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.150" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">he was terrifically capable of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.849" end="00:56:05.740" style="s2">controlling his body&#39;s physiological</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:07.000" style="s2">reactions he could drink a lot without</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.740" end="00:56:09.580" style="s2">getting drunk he could</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.000" end="00:56:14.670" style="s2">into battle in winter without any right</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.580" end="00:56:19.170" style="s2">shoes on his feet he was famously brave</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.670" end="00:56:21.430" style="s2">so he and he had this divine voice</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.170" end="00:56:22.090" style="s2">whenever he was about to do something</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.430" end="00:56:24.670" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.090" end="00:56:28.420" style="s2">he&#39;d hear this voice that would tell him</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.670" end="00:56:32.530" style="s2">don&#39;t do it Socrates so once again you</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.420" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">still find right the shamanic has been</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.530" end="00:56:36.070" style="s2">carried into the socratic in really</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:39.730" style="s2">important ways we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.070" end="00:56:45.360" style="s2">later how those two are interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.730" end="00:56:49.330" style="s2">together now Socrates has many followers</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.360" end="00:56:51.070" style="s2">but there&#39;s one person who was present</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.330" end="00:56:54.790" style="s2">at the trial but wasn&#39;t present at his</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.070" end="00:56:56.760" style="s2">death when he drinks the hemlock and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.790" end="00:56:59.650" style="s2">know what I got to sit in the spot in</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.760" end="00:57:01.750" style="s2">Athens that corresponds to where</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.650" end="00:57:07.780" style="s2">Socrates was probably imprisoned at</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.750" end="00:57:10.900" style="s2">least that&#39;s what they said that person</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.780" end="00:57:13.620" style="s2">who was present at the trial then even</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.900" end="00:57:16.300" style="s2">offers to pay for Socrates his release</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.620" end="00:57:20.860" style="s2">but is ill and not present at his death</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.300" end="00:57:24.370" style="s2">his Plato and Plato as I foreshadowed is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.860" end="00:57:28.030" style="s2">going to take Pythagoras and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.370" end="00:57:30.610" style="s2">and put them together and advance even</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.030" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">more significantly the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.610" end="00:57:34.070" style="s2">in ancient Greece thank you very much</p>
