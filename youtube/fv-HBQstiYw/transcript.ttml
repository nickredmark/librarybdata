<p begin="00:00:05.629" end="00:00:12.030" style="s2">so this is the latest rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.220" end="00:00:14.190" style="s2">podcast an exciting one because this</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.030" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">morning I did an interview with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.190" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">Peterson which is the second interview</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done and the first time I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">seen him since</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">I saw him last October which we then</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:27.420" style="s2">turned into the documentary truth from</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:33.450" style="s2">the time of chaos and then glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.420" end="00:00:35.219" style="s2">matrix so yeah really exciting - yes I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.450" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">sort of see where he&#39;s at and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.219" end="00:00:39.620" style="s2">the kind of trajectory that he&#39;s been on</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">since then has just been so exponential</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.620" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">and yeah I was really pleased with like</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:49.250" style="s2">we talked about sort of being a bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">concerned he was getting burnt out and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.250" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">didn&#39;t get a sense of that at all from</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:57.899" style="s2">from meeting him it was really yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">was on good form and I think we got some</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.899" end="00:01:01.890" style="s2">really really interesting stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.399" end="00:01:04.199" style="s2">we&#39;re going to play some of it in this</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.890" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">podcast referring specifically to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.199" end="00:01:12.060" style="s2">Sam Harris debates because that just</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">happened and yeah so he&#39;s done four four</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.060" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">debates with Sam Harris now - in</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">Vancouver one in Dublin one in London on</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">the subject of religion versus atheism</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">and the other thing is to kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.850" style="s2">forward to what else is coming up we</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:28.409" style="s2">just come back from the u.s. we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.850" end="00:01:30.960" style="s2">huge amount of content some really</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.409" end="00:01:32.540" style="s2">exciting stuff we just put out an</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.960" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">interview with Paul van der clay the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.540" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">kind of pastor from Sacramento who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">becoming kind of a little mini online</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">celebrity because it was commentaries on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">and one person commented the pastor of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">Paul van der clay officially the pastor</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">of the IDW congratulations Paul it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">official three YouTube comments making</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">the same one makes it actually official</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">so good so yeah Sam Harris and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:04.830" style="s2">Pederson so I haven&#39;t been to any of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">these debates</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.830" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">and but we&#39;ve listened someone&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">sneekly put some of the audio online so</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:12.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve listened to some of the stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.890" style="s2">Vancouver and some of the stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.600" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">from London a couple of nights ago and</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:21.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve also commented quite like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">been interested ourselves and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.120" end="00:02:27.240" style="s2">this interplay between like we&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:29.040" style="s2">quite a few times for for me for you I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.240" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">think as well John and Peter Som</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.040" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">represents a kind of potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">reintegration of the sacred grounding in</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">neuroscience grounding it in mythology</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:42.210" style="s2">and it&#39;s clear that Sam Harris is very</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">sort of the irony is they&#39;re both within</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.210" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">this kind of loose collective called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">IDW but they&#39;ve clearly got very</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:49.740" style="s2">different perspectives which I guess is</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:51.960" style="s2">why so many people have gone to see them</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.740" end="00:02:54.600" style="s2">talk over the last kind of four days</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.960" end="00:02:56.790" style="s2">from me you know equally listening to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">the kind of the bootlegged stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.790" end="00:03:02.250" style="s2">kind of engaging with the debates there</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:03.630" style="s2">is a sense of something new happening in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:07.350" style="s2">the sense that the traditional kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.630" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">new atheist argument has this real focus</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.350" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">on religion almost as a political force</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">and the kind of irrationality of it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">all of that but some of which I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:17.100" style="s2">engage with some of which I would even</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">you know agree with but what Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.100" end="00:03:20.520" style="s2">seems to be bringing and what these</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">debates are kind of exploring is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:25.770" style="s2">different kind of exploration of maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">what we call the religious impulse</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.770" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">rather than looking specifically at</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">religion but taking that deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">and looking at the impulse within us as</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:40.110" style="s2">you know the biological historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:43.380" style="s2">cultural impulse in us which is so deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.110" end="00:03:45.180" style="s2">to be religious creatures and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.380" end="00:03:47.790" style="s2">I feel like Jordan Peterson it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.180" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">or or reintroducing that into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.790" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">culture and Sammis is holding a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">different piece which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.500" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">warning against the fundamentalism that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:03:58.050" style="s2">can come about with religion which is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">fair warning definitely but the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.050" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to explore is that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:04.860" style="s2">kind of viewpoint in itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:06.690" style="s2">we could call scientism is in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.860" end="00:04:09.110" style="s2">becoming a fundamental fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.690" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">itself it&#39;s not already if not already</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.110" end="00:04:12.780" style="s2">and this is something we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:15.250" style="s2">explore so we&#39;re going to play a clip</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.780" end="00:04:16.359" style="s2">now the first one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.250" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">first questions I asked Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.359" end="00:04:22.420" style="s2">Peterson about this which was started by</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">talking about the IDW which we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.420" end="00:04:29.320" style="s2">out at some future time but the what a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:31.210" style="s2">lot of people are sensing from the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.320" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">why it&#39;s sort of quite kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.210" end="00:04:35.350" style="s2">intellectually dark web for any of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">people haven&#39;t been watching our other</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.350" end="00:04:40.600" style="s2">stuff is there&#39;s a sense of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">asking really big questions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.600" end="00:04:45.070" style="s2">some really big ideas and great thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:47.080" style="s2">in it but ultimately what I think people</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.070" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">are tuning into is a sense of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.080" end="00:04:51.190" style="s2">thinking in public and a sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:53.820" style="s2">is what it looks like for two people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.190" end="00:04:56.470" style="s2">engage in a generative dialogue around</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.820" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">different ideas and one that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.470" end="00:05:01.390" style="s2">builds so so yeah that&#39;s that was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:03.820" style="s2">starting point of this question that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.390" end="00:05:06.850" style="s2">we&#39;re going to roll now there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.820" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">of intellectual curiosity and a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.850" end="00:05:11.980" style="s2">people thinking in public and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:13.330" style="s2">there&#39;s also a sense of maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.980" end="00:05:15.940" style="s2">potential for people to change their</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.330" end="00:05:17.290" style="s2">minds or to discover things during the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.940" end="00:05:19.540" style="s2">conversation well that&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.290" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">appreciation of the intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.540" end="00:05:24.280" style="s2">audience it&#39;s like and I would say it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:26.470" style="s2">actually the manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.280" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">process of thinking that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.470" end="00:05:30.580" style="s2">important than the conclusions that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.570" end="00:05:32.860" style="s2">generated even in these discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.580" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having with Harris like we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.860" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">trying to to argue out to different</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:42.729" style="s2">viewpoints because Harris believes that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:45.310" style="s2">values can be derived with with with</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.729" end="00:05:47.770" style="s2">unerring precision in some sense using</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.310" end="00:05:50.560" style="s2">the proper methodology from facts and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.770" end="00:05:51.640" style="s2">I believe that it&#39;s more complicated</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.560" end="00:05:53.620" style="s2">than that that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.640" end="00:05:56.919" style="s2">intermediating structures and those are</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.620" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">really narrative in in their nature so</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.919" end="00:06:02.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a technical argument as well as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:04.210" style="s2">a variety of sub arguments about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.320" end="00:06:07.840" style="s2">relative role of traditional religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.210" end="00:06:11.380" style="s2">and so forth but the outcome of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.840" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">debate about those issues is partly what</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.380" end="00:06:17.229" style="s2">people are coming to the talks to see to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:20.830" style="s2">determine what should the conclusions be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.229" end="00:06:24.160" style="s2">but a much larger part perhaps is to in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.830" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">to observe and engage at least by proxy</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:28.930" style="s2">in the process of dialogue and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:31.060" style="s2">more important because</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.990" end="00:07:02.650" style="s2">based on what Jordan Peterson was just</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.610" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">saying and then also listening to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.650" end="00:07:07.990" style="s2">pod sort to the debate what really</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:13.000" style="s2">struck me was was one particular moment</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.990" end="00:07:14.770" style="s2">when Sam Harris mentioned you know talks</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.000" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">about the mystical or I don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.770" end="00:07:18.160" style="s2">would refer to this mystical experiences</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:19.570" style="s2">but the deep experiences he&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.160" end="00:07:21.370" style="s2">through Buddhism and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.570" end="00:07:24.340" style="s2">psychedelics as well and then he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.370" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">makes a comment around yeah but I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.340" end="00:07:27.820" style="s2">sort of Marshall tol&#39;able was the word</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.590" end="00:07:29.620" style="s2">but something around that I wasn&#39;t kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.820" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">of gullible enough to kind of attribute</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.620" end="00:07:32.830" style="s2">that to something other than the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">workings of my own mind and then Peter</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.830" end="00:07:37.510" style="s2">says it says you need to take a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">dose and sir it&#39;s a great moment in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.510" end="00:07:42.190" style="s2">debate as well and it really you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:44.139" style="s2">even though it&#39;s kind of a fun moment it</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.190" end="00:07:47.500" style="s2">also points to maybe for me one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.139" end="00:07:50.530" style="s2">deepest aspects of this because in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.500" end="00:07:52.570" style="s2">debate I get a sense that Harris his his</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.530" end="00:07:55.630" style="s2">understanding or his model of religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.570" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">that he&#39;s putting out is one which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.630" end="00:08:00.130" style="s2">very much the structured religions and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:02.199" style="s2">Andrew Sweeney in a recent piece on</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.130" end="00:08:04.210" style="s2">rebel wisdom he mentioned that this</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.199" end="00:08:08.020" style="s2">model of a God with like a bearded man</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:11.380" style="s2">in the sky that the kind of atheist tend</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.020" end="00:08:13.180" style="s2">to use is not really the religious</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.380" end="00:08:14.919" style="s2">understanding of the model of God that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.180" end="00:08:16.990" style="s2">people who for whom religion is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.919" end="00:08:18.940" style="s2">important part of their lives use no one</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.990" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">who&#39;s serious about religion believes</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">that type of model at all and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:27.550" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.330" end="00:08:29.470" style="s2">because it gets back to that point of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.550" end="00:08:32.469" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.470" end="00:08:34.060" style="s2">internal experience we have the internal</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.469" end="00:08:35.770" style="s2">religious experience which is about</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.060" end="00:08:37.630" style="s2">experiencing the transcendent it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.770" end="00:08:38.919" style="s2">believing in anything it&#39;s no belief</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.630" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no space for belief it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.919" end="00:08:42.219" style="s2">have an internal experience that is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.219" end="00:08:46.060" style="s2">religious drive and that is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:47.350" style="s2">religious experience I think Harris is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.060" end="00:08:49.750" style="s2">absolutely right in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.350" end="00:08:51.459" style="s2">cannot take that experience I can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.750" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">some deep psychedelic experience if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.459" end="00:08:56.709" style="s2">like David I&#39;ve just figured out that</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:08:57.879" style="s2">everyone&#39;s we&#39;re actually earth isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.709" end="00:09:00.730" style="s2">earth we&#39;re actually all sitting on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.879" end="00:09:02.470" style="s2">massive green elephant and I really need</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.730" end="00:09:04.120" style="s2">everyone to know this so we have really</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.470" end="00:09:08.290" style="s2">going to put this out there you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.120" end="00:09:11.589" style="s2">that because science is the language we</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.290" end="00:09:13.089" style="s2">use for you and me to agree on what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.589" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">can both agree on like look through this</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.089" end="00:09:16.750" style="s2">telescope what do you see okay well I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:18.129" style="s2">have a hypothesis about it well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:20.139" style="s2">gonna try and disprove my hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.129" end="00:09:22.899" style="s2">until we reach a synthesis where we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.139" end="00:09:26.500" style="s2">be reasonably like really really sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.899" end="00:09:30.069" style="s2">about what&#39;s in that telescope so those</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.500" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">two things they can&#39;t cross over and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.069" end="00:09:34.600" style="s2">integral studies as big on this they</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.730" style="s2">can&#39;t cross over but they can coexist so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.600" end="00:09:38.350" style="s2">finally the Petersons point around its</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">the discourse that&#39;s in a sense more</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.350" end="00:09:42.129" style="s2">important that really connected with me</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:43.990" style="s2">when he when he says that because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.129" end="00:09:47.949" style="s2">could do a thousand debates and they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.990" end="00:09:50.860" style="s2">never ever going to solve this the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.949" end="00:09:52.899" style="s2">science versus spirituality thing yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.860" end="00:09:55.059" style="s2">mean listening to the recent one at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.899" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">o2 you get the sense oof and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.059" end="00:09:58.899" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the sense since Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:02.319" style="s2">Harris started talking that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.899" end="00:10:06.540" style="s2">talking past each other yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.319" end="00:10:08.529" style="s2">frequently hear Sam accusing Jordan of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.540" end="00:10:10.750" style="s2">not answering the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.529" end="00:10:13.059" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting listening to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.750" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t get that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.059" end="00:10:18.370" style="s2">Jordan was him was avoiding the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:19.509" style="s2">like it&#39;s interesting I mean I probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.370" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">listen to a lot of Jordan Peters and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.509" end="00:10:22.750" style="s2">stuff and listen to quite a lot of sam</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.600" style="s2">Harris&#39;s stuff as well like I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.750" end="00:10:26.769" style="s2">lot of respect for the waking up podcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.600" end="00:10:28.059" style="s2">there was a spectator article this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.769" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">morning really good spectre article</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.059" end="00:10:32.620" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll link to it under this where</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.800" end="00:10:34.389" style="s2">the writer was saying he he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.620" end="00:10:36.819" style="s2">Jordan Pederson has a bigger view than</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.389" end="00:10:38.350" style="s2">sam Harris that he understands Sam</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.819" end="00:10:39.850" style="s2">Harris&#39;s perspective better than Sam</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.350" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">Harris&#39;s understands Jordan Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.850" end="00:10:44.019" style="s2">perspective now I think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:48.069" style="s2">obviously we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.019" end="00:10:50.410" style="s2">stuff about Jordan Peterson and just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.069" end="00:10:51.250" style="s2">point we did actually ask if sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.410" end="00:10:52.990" style="s2">would be available for an interview</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.250" end="00:10:53.800" style="s2">while he was here in London but he</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.990" end="00:10:55.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.800" end="00:10:56.230" style="s2">because I&#39;d love to put some of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.000" end="00:10:58.450" style="s2">stuff to him so Sam if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.230" end="00:11:01.780" style="s2">we&#39;d love to interview you give you a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.450" end="00:11:05.320" style="s2">chance to respond and but I but I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.780" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">get the sense that there was a frequent</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.320" end="00:11:10.930" style="s2">kind of reducing to caricature by Sam</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:12.280" style="s2">Harris that I didn&#39;t think I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.930" end="00:11:14.200" style="s2">that feeling from Peterson Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.280" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">staff is a huge amount of his his</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.200" end="00:11:20.140" style="s2">comments with yes yes but like including</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:22.420" style="s2">like he includes a lot of what sam says</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.140" end="00:11:25.480" style="s2">sam kind of seems to continually reduce</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.420" end="00:11:29.530" style="s2">it down to the material or to the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.480" end="00:11:30.940" style="s2">and peterson says yes and which which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.530" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">really interesting because we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.940" end="00:11:34.510" style="s2">integral theory quite a lot in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:36.610" style="s2">idea is yes and peterson seems to be yes</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.510" end="00:11:38.860" style="s2">handing sam harris an awful lot he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.610" end="00:11:41.380" style="s2">saying to sam harris is saying we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.860" end="00:11:43.990" style="s2">hang on are you saying that this was</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.380" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">divinely inspired how can you tell you</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.990" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">that this book was divinely inspired and</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:50.290" style="s2">peterson is saying well we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:52.510" style="s2">where creativity comes from that in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.290" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">sense creativity comes from somewhere we</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.510" end="00:11:56.260" style="s2">don&#39;t understand and if you take</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">creativity over millenia where things</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.260" end="00:12:01.510" style="s2">are refined and refined and refined what</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:03.460" style="s2">is kept of that particular story has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.510" end="00:12:06.220" style="s2">reflect something has to reflect some</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.460" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">kind of divine reality or what it has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.220" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">reflect some kind of reality which you</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:12.370" style="s2">can choose to call divine or not and Sam</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:14.260" style="s2">continued kind of just brings it back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.370" end="00:12:17.640" style="s2">know this is just people&#39;s imagination</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.260" end="00:12:20.350" style="s2">or just this this is just so I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.640" end="00:12:22.990" style="s2">yeah very frequently the Peterson takes</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.350" end="00:12:25.480" style="s2">does understand that incorporates Sam</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.990" end="00:12:27.970" style="s2">Harris&#39;s reductive world view but frames</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.480" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">it within something more and yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.970" end="00:12:32.080" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good point another thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:33.460" style="s2">that struck me somehow it actually makes</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.080" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">a really good point towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.460" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">the last debate where he says look he</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:38.290" style="s2">starts talking about consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:39.610" style="s2">our understanding of what consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.290" end="00:12:40.900" style="s2">is and he said you know that could&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.610" end="00:12:42.790" style="s2">been a place we started this particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.900" end="00:12:44.050" style="s2">debate and they may well have covered</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.790" end="00:12:46.630" style="s2">that in the in the first two I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.050" end="00:12:48.340" style="s2">sure if as I&#39;ve seen them but that is I</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.630" end="00:12:50.170" style="s2">think a really key question because</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.340" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">there&#39;s you know we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.170" end="00:12:54.390" style="s2">soft problem of consciousness and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:58.410" style="s2">hard problem and the soft problem is</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.390" end="00:13:00.370" style="s2">effectively how is our neurobiology</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.410" end="00:13:02.200" style="s2">involved in how we perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.370" end="00:13:04.030" style="s2">and that&#39;s soft because we can do brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.200" end="00:13:05.529" style="s2">scans and we can look at it and we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.030" end="00:13:07.569" style="s2">you know we can experiment back and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.529" end="00:13:10.329" style="s2">that out pretty much the hard problem is</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.569" end="00:13:11.829" style="s2">what is consciousness and you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.329" end="00:13:15.999" style="s2">local or non-local as in is</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.829" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">consciousness a quality of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.999" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">which is everywhere and we happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:23.620" style="s2">recipients of that really yeah pantheism</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:25.209" style="s2">effectively or is it specifically just</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.620" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">in the human mind you know all of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.209" end="00:13:29.439" style="s2">question that has not been answered yet</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:32.769" style="s2">and it also there is a sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.439" end="00:13:34.329" style="s2">can&#39;t be answered yeah so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.769" end="00:13:39.009" style="s2">this is where I keep coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.329" end="00:13:41.800" style="s2">the sort of my real frustration with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.009" end="00:13:43.749" style="s2">more strict strict materialist types</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.800" end="00:13:45.459" style="s2">because you can&#39;t have a worldview that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.749" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">says well we understand pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.459" end="00:13:49.660" style="s2">everything apart from consciousness like</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:51.069" style="s2">okay so you can understand absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:52.389" style="s2">everything apart from the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.069" end="00:13:54.999" style="s2">experiencing absolutely everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.389" end="00:13:59.529" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty big hole in your theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.999" end="00:14:02.470" style="s2">and to maintain this kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.529" end="00:14:05.499" style="s2">dogmatic materialism without accepting</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.470" end="00:14:06.790" style="s2">that this is you you&#39;re like okay just</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.499" end="00:14:08.769" style="s2">give me that one miracle of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.790" end="00:14:10.360" style="s2">that we can experience anything and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.769" end="00:14:13.300" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain everything it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.360" end="00:14:14.889" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re you&#39;re asking for a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.300" end="00:14:16.329" style="s2">different kind of because they argue</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.889" end="00:14:17.829" style="s2">that religion is sort of miraculous or</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.329" end="00:14:19.449" style="s2">magical thinking it&#39;s like no actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.829" end="00:14:21.759" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a magical thinking going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.449" end="00:14:23.680" style="s2">as well just the same as believers yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.759" end="00:14:25.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a good point as well and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.680" end="00:14:28.870" style="s2">and not just the magical thinking but</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:30.279" style="s2">also the the dangers of dogmatism that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.870" end="00:14:31.870" style="s2">can come about not talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.279" end="00:14:34.569" style="s2">heresy necessarily just that what my</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.870" end="00:14:36.189" style="s2">experience of very extreme materialists</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.569" end="00:14:37.930" style="s2">because I&#39;m one of the organizers of</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.189" end="00:14:39.819" style="s2">breaking convention of psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.930" end="00:14:41.709" style="s2">conference and that is possibly the main</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.819" end="00:14:43.870" style="s2">tension of that conference is we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.709" end="00:14:45.730" style="s2">neuro scientists and we have I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.870" end="00:14:48.879" style="s2">Psychonauts and explorers and artists</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.730" end="00:14:51.750" style="s2">and poets and all sorts and the tension</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.879" end="00:14:55.149" style="s2">is between the materialist worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.750" end="00:14:56.620" style="s2">one which is more centered on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.149" end="00:14:58.990" style="s2">phenomenology of the experience and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.620" end="00:15:00.429" style="s2">mystery and faith not faith isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.990" end="00:15:03.209" style="s2">the right word but the religious</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.429" end="00:15:05.589" style="s2">experience let&#39;s call it and I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.209" end="00:15:09.249" style="s2">what I pick up from the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.589" end="00:15:12.040" style="s2">materialists is a value system in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.249" end="00:15:15.100" style="s2">internal experience and the claims or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.040" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">the the value of internal experience is</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.100" end="00:15:21.180" style="s2">lower than the value of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:23.100" style="s2">scientific reason always that those two</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.180" end="00:15:25.740" style="s2">things there now I think they should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.100" end="00:15:27.779" style="s2">on equal footing but in different</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.740" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">domains and serve different roles but</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.779" end="00:15:33.720" style="s2">the smugness and the snide miss comes I</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:35.339" style="s2">think from partly from that value</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.720" end="00:15:38.250" style="s2">structure yeah I think this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.339" end="00:15:41.880" style="s2">place to start the the second Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.250" end="00:15:44.010" style="s2">Pederson clip because yeah I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.880" end="00:15:46.830" style="s2">talks to this sort of potential</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.010" end="00:15:50.310" style="s2">dogmatism on the materialist side as</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.830" end="00:15:52.890" style="s2">well so roll number two I read The</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.310" end="00:15:54.209" style="s2">Spectator review of your recent</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.890" end="00:15:55.500" style="s2">conversation I think you&#39;ve now come to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.209" end="00:15:57.959" style="s2">the end of your debates for Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.500" end="00:15:59.700" style="s2">and they said that you expressed a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.959" end="00:16:02.040" style="s2">little bit of irritation at some of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.700" end="00:16:03.720" style="s2">when Sam didn&#39;t grass some of the points</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.040" end="00:16:04.890" style="s2">that you were making or that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.720" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">fully appreciate that he&#39;d and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.890" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">understood them I also think that Sam</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.610" style="s2">Harris in particular like he&#39;s built a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:14.339" style="s2">whole kind of personality career several</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.610" end="00:16:17.220" style="s2">books on this atheism position do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.339" end="00:16:19.890" style="s2">think that he can argue in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.220" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">from that perspective could he turn</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.890" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">around and say well actually no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:26.010" style="s2">right Jordan this atheism thing is it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">think he was I think he was I think he</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.010" end="00:16:30.029" style="s2">was conducting the discussion in good</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:32.459" style="s2">faith I actually think that what Sam is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.029" end="00:16:35.790" style="s2">doing is a good-faith project you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.459" end="00:16:41.010" style="s2">he I think there&#39;s conceptual muddiness</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.790" end="00:16:43.860" style="s2">about it but you know his basic premise</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.010" end="00:16:46.760" style="s2">is that we could come to an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.860" end="00:16:51.200" style="s2">that working to reduce unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.760" end="00:16:53.339" style="s2">misery and suffering is a universal good</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:55.320" style="s2">okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.339" end="00:16:57.690" style="s2">that seems like a reasonable proposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.320" end="00:16:59.640" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a proposition of fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.690" end="00:17:01.380" style="s2">and he claims that it is but that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.640" end="00:17:04.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter still it&#39;s fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.380" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">then and then you know so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.260" end="00:17:08.730" style="s2">proposition another proposition is it</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:13.079" style="s2">would be really good if our systems of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.730" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">value weren&#39;t founded on air and what do</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.079" end="00:17:16.980" style="s2">we have that&#39;s not air well we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.630" style="s2">facts we have objective facts I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.980" end="00:17:20.309" style="s2">look at the technology look at what</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.630" end="00:17:21.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve done with our science it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.309" end="00:17:23.850" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to underestimate the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.839" end="00:17:25.380" style="s2">utility of objective facts so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.850" end="00:17:27.480" style="s2">can ground the value structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.380" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">facts it&#39;s like well that would be good</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.480" end="00:17:31.950" style="s2">if we could do it so and and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:34.170" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.950" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">his ethic let&#39;s say is an amalgam of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.170" end="00:17:38.580" style="s2">those two propositions and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">his project is honorable and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:44.070" style="s2">think he&#39;s committed to it he also</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:47.070" style="s2">rightly is concerned with the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.070" end="00:17:51.680" style="s2">the fundamentalist dangers of revealed</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.070" end="00:17:55.530" style="s2">truth and so is very skeptical about</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.680" end="00:18:03.260" style="s2">about the axiomatic claims of dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.530" end="00:18:03.260" style="s2">religion it&#39;s like yeah fair enough but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.530" end="00:18:09.800" style="s2">his the mechanisms that he outlines to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.080" end="00:18:12.180" style="s2">derive values from facts are</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.800" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">insufficient in my estimation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.180" end="00:18:17.670" style="s2">think that his argument is sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:20.940" style="s2">sophisticated even though I don&#39;t doubt</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.670" end="00:18:24.450" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t think that Sam is any less</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.940" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">committed to an ethical good it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.450" end="00:18:31.490" style="s2">obvious to me that he is than I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:33.990" style="s2">you know and he&#39;s argued and discussed</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.490" end="00:18:35.910" style="s2">fully in good faith as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.990" end="00:18:40.800" style="s2">concerned you know with the with the odd</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.910" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">error because no one is negotiating 100%</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.800" end="00:18:46.290" style="s2">all the time in good faith I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:48.540" style="s2">a standard that no one can can achieve</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.290" end="00:18:50.820" style="s2">but I think the discussions have been</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.540" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">unbelievably productive and and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.820" end="00:18:53.820" style="s2">see that certainly the crowds are</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:55.380" style="s2">responding I don&#39;t think the crowds</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.380" end="00:19:00.210" style="s2">have been wouldn&#39;t been discussing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.540" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">good faith you know because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.210" end="00:19:04.230" style="s2">engagement is actually an indication</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:06.240" style="s2">that a good faith discussion is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.230" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">occurring otherwise it gets dull very</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:09.990" style="s2">very rapidly we&#39;ll see what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:12.990" style="s2">the videos are released</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.990" end="00:19:15.030" style="s2">and that&#39;ll be in August once there the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.990" end="00:19:17.700" style="s2">sound is edited and all of that and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.030" end="00:19:21.240" style="s2">then people will have a public debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.700" end="00:19:23.640" style="s2">about how it how the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.240" end="00:19:25.800" style="s2">proceeded I also think that each</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.640" end="00:19:28.230" style="s2">discussion built on the previous one and</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.800" end="00:19:29.880" style="s2">that we both ended up I think we both</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.230" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">ended up more informed and more</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.880" end="00:19:34.410" style="s2">articulate than we started out so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:36.180" style="s2">a good that&#39;s a really good thing I</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.410" end="00:19:39.720" style="s2">certainly understand his arguments much</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.180" end="00:19:42.600" style="s2">better than I did well a year ago let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.720" end="00:19:44.070" style="s2">say I think that exchange kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.600" end="00:19:45.250" style="s2">illustrates the point that I made I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.070" end="00:19:46.809" style="s2">like they asked him</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.250" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">whether sam harris was arguing in good</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.809" end="00:19:49.750" style="s2">faith because if i mean if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">it from this perspective look sam house</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.750" end="00:19:53.230" style="s2">is written like two or three books on</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">atheism he is one of the most kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.230" end="00:19:58.299" style="s2">noted celebrate&#39; celebrity atheists with</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:19:59.530" style="s2">possible exception richard dawkins so he</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.299" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">had a huge amount professionally at</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.530" end="00:20:04.450" style="s2">stake so i guess my question about good</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:07.539" style="s2">faith was is it possible for him to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.450" end="00:20:09.250" style="s2">change his mind and i was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.539" end="00:20:11.530" style="s2">looking yeah i really didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.250" end="00:20:15.159" style="s2">what jordan would say about that i had a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.530" end="00:20:17.559" style="s2">sense that yeah that there was some</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.159" end="00:20:19.900" style="s2">irritation sometimes in the way sam was</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.559" end="00:20:20.980" style="s2">kind of caricature or or minimizing some</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.900" end="00:20:22.720" style="s2">of the things that he was saying so i</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.980" end="00:20:26.679" style="s2">was genuinely interested in whether he</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.720" end="00:20:30.039" style="s2">thought that and genuinely kind of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.679" end="00:20:31.960" style="s2">really interested in his response which</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.039" end="00:20:33.940" style="s2">i kind of found to be like that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.960" end="00:20:35.350" style="s2">a this fan seemed to me to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.940" end="00:20:36.789" style="s2">generosity in there it&#39;s like we all</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.350" end="00:20:38.770" style="s2">really value sam&#39;s project i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.789" end="00:20:40.360" style="s2">really good and a lot of honesty about</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.770" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">where he sees and conceptual modernist</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.360" end="00:20:44.140" style="s2">and and all the rest of it but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:48.190" style="s2">interesting thing for me is reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.140" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">below the comments on the leaked the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.190" end="00:20:53.110" style="s2">recently leaked talk from london and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:54.789" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this a few times like the Matt</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.110" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">Dillahunty talked with Peterson as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.789" end="00:21:02.350" style="s2">I find this the material the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:05.980" style="s2">atheist types to be far more dismissive</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.350" end="00:21:07.630" style="s2">of Peterson Oh Sam destroyed Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.980" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s avoiding arts answering the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.630" end="00:21:12.280" style="s2">question all of this I find them far</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.600" end="00:21:15.130" style="s2">more dismissive of Peterson that I hear</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.280" end="00:21:18.070" style="s2">Peterson being a Paris or generally</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.130" end="00:21:19.720" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s fans being of Harris which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.070" end="00:21:23.110" style="s2">interesting it kind of speaks to what we</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.720" end="00:21:27.789" style="s2">said before the danger of a dogmatism in</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.110" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">the Atheist camp that can become a kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.789" end="00:21:34.299" style="s2">of new religion yeah and as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:37.260" style="s2">saying that I&#39;m something came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.299" end="00:21:39.880" style="s2">which I thought in the past which is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.260" end="00:21:41.590" style="s2">when atheism does go that far</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.880" end="00:21:42.970" style="s2">and it won&#39;t be all of his supporters</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.590" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">but it&#39;ll be you know some there is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.970" end="00:21:48.659" style="s2">strand in the world when it does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">becomes a religion in a sense based on</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.659" end="00:21:52.840" style="s2">being able to control everything there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.309" style="s2">there&#39;s a real sense of that for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.840" end="00:21:55.929" style="s2">because you know Peterson in that clip</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.309" end="00:21:57.970" style="s2">talked about it will be good if our</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.929" end="00:21:58.870" style="s2">values weren&#39;t based on air and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.970" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">really stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.870" end="00:22:03.100" style="s2">I was like hmm but going back to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.320" style="s2">sense of we don&#39;t know where creativity</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.100" end="00:22:06.520" style="s2">comes from we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know just</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.320" end="00:22:08.910" style="s2">that with respect for the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.520" end="00:22:12.070" style="s2">respect for the mystery and the ego</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.910" end="00:22:14.230" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t like letting go into a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.070" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">mystery you know that&#39;s that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.230" end="00:22:19.510" style="s2">the inside of a lot of the Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:22.059" style="s2">traditions as well so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.510" end="00:22:25.570" style="s2">strikes me as an interesting point</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.059" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">because I mean to be honest the irony is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.570" end="00:22:30.700" style="s2">the the pre-socratic philosophers they</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">were getting their information</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.700" end="00:22:34.300" style="s2">Parmenides and pedak Li&#39;s they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:38.740" style="s2">receiving their wisdom which became</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.300" end="00:22:41.710" style="s2">logic from mysterious kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.740" end="00:22:45.070" style="s2">transcendent experiences so we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.710" end="00:22:48.070" style="s2">based our values to a degree on what</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.070" end="00:22:50.700" style="s2">they might call err but that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.070" end="00:22:53.020" style="s2">concept they might see as air is</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.700" end="00:22:54.280" style="s2">actually something potentially very</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.020" end="00:22:55.480" style="s2">different I would see it as something</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.280" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">potentially very different that it has</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.480" end="00:22:59.740" style="s2">substance in it that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:23:01.720" style="s2">substance that arises up that might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.740" end="00:23:04.150" style="s2">the root of creativity or you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.320" style="s2">whatever else we don&#39;t know but that</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.150" end="00:23:07.030" style="s2">sense if we don&#39;t know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.320" end="00:23:09.130" style="s2">humility in map and there&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.030" end="00:23:10.390" style="s2">much humility in we do know when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.130" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">just a matter and anything we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.390" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of time till we</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.070" style="s2">figure it out with science yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:17.770" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I&#39;ve thought as</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.070" end="00:23:20.140" style="s2">well it&#39;s like at some point your axioms</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.770" end="00:23:23.040" style="s2">have to be or not have to be that your</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.140" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">axioms are based on something irrational</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.040" end="00:23:28.540" style="s2">you cannot rationally derive axioms so</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:30.280" style="s2">the idea that we can be purely rational</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.540" end="00:23:32.740" style="s2">at some point you are making a leap of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.280" end="00:23:34.059" style="s2">faith you cannot avoid making a leap of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.740" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">faith it&#39;s like what is your what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.059" end="00:23:36.940" style="s2">your leap of faith going to be what are</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:39.130" style="s2">your original axioms going to be you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.940" end="00:23:41.260" style="s2">have to kind of at some point assume</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.130" end="00:23:43.330" style="s2">some things and so what are those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.260" end="00:23:46.300" style="s2">and what was really interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.330" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">in the in the o2 debate one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.300" end="00:23:50.950" style="s2">things Douglas Murray said which was</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.890" end="00:23:54.250" style="s2">what we&#39;re seeing in the world seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.950" end="00:23:55.809" style="s2">be that when you remove religion people</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.250" end="00:23:57.309" style="s2">will make new religions out of anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.809" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">and I think we&#39;re seeing this</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.309" end="00:24:01.179" style="s2">particularly on the left at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:04.030" style="s2">sort of like the whole equality</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.179" end="00:24:08.350" style="s2">diversity what you might call didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.030" end="00:24:10.269" style="s2">call SJW thinking or has become a new</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.350" end="00:24:13.119" style="s2">religion I think we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.269" end="00:24:16.599" style="s2">this is there&#39;s there&#39;s a really real</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.119" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">dogmatism that seems to have arisen that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.599" end="00:24:22.359" style="s2">that is replacing the the old religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:24.129" style="s2">stories and obviously also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.359" end="00:24:25.539" style="s2">returning us to group identity and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.129" end="00:24:26.979" style="s2">danger of that in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.539" end="00:24:28.749" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual and all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.979" end="00:24:30.519" style="s2">that which which I talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.749" end="00:24:32.459" style="s2">Jordan Peters in quite a bit more will</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.519" end="00:24:38.589" style="s2">have coming up in one of our future</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.459" end="00:24:40.119" style="s2">future videos what was also reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.589" end="00:24:42.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a great line one of the guys</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.119" end="00:24:45.729" style="s2">that we interviewed in America talked</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.339" end="00:24:48.549" style="s2">about so scientism is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.729" end="00:24:50.829" style="s2">worldview that sort of sees Sciences as</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.549" end="00:24:52.179" style="s2">the guys in their white coats the new</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.179" end="00:24:55.659" style="s2">and it happens at the very subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.889" end="00:24:57.789" style="s2">level it&#39;s like you use scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.659" end="00:25:00.399" style="s2">validation to to support something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.789" end="00:25:01.690" style="s2">oh the benefits of meditation oh it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.139" end="00:25:47.009" style="s2">question once you&#39;ve removed kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.599" end="00:25:49.479" style="s2">ethical grounds which we could argue</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.009" end="00:25:51.639" style="s2">Rupert Sheldrake and one of our videos</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.479" end="00:25:54.429" style="s2">argued they&#39;re ultimately Christian in</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.639" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">origin but this ethical basis that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.429" end="00:25:58.629" style="s2">take is self-evident sam harris is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:01.239" style="s2">actually based in a heart whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.629" end="00:26:03.459" style="s2">christian story that&#39;s acted out through</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.239" end="00:26:05.769" style="s2">our actions and through our assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.459" end="00:26:08.139" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.769" end="00:26:10.769" style="s2">worldview you get rid of that and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.139" end="00:26:13.509" style="s2">don&#39;t get an emergent morality you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.769" end="00:26:16.149" style="s2">science torn free of emergent morality</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.509" end="00:26:18.909" style="s2">and that as yeah that is a terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.149" end="00:26:20.229" style="s2">prospect yeah definitely and i murray</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.909" end="00:26:23.149" style="s2">makes a really good i thought that was a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.229" end="00:26:25.159" style="s2">really good point by murray is round</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.149" end="00:26:26.450" style="s2">that those new religions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.159" end="00:26:28.460" style="s2">seeing effectively which are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.450" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">ideological kind of semi strange</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.460" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">political sjw style religions and and on</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">both sides in fact it&#39;s like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:38.389" style="s2">based on what&#39;s come before they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.129" style="s2">those the pp says the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.389" end="00:26:42.019" style="s2">doing that they don&#39;t know what their</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.129" end="00:26:43.669" style="s2">ancestors created before that is trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.019" end="00:26:46.690" style="s2">to create this split and build something</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.669" end="00:26:48.529" style="s2">on foundations that don&#39;t really exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.690" end="00:26:50.509" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s quite a strong</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.529" end="00:26:51.919" style="s2">argument for really engaging in religion</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.509" end="00:26:55.549" style="s2">and seeing how these systems have</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.919" end="00:26:58.309" style="s2">survived for so long and what tenants</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.549" end="00:27:02.359" style="s2">they hold which is another subtlety</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.309" end="00:27:04.719" style="s2">which was in the debate around religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.359" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">as a political institution</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.719" end="00:27:08.509" style="s2">organized religion which I would be with</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:10.849" style="s2">Sam Harris on around the massive</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.509" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">problems with that and religion as</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.849" end="00:27:14.749" style="s2">Jordan Peterson talks about it which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:17.419" style="s2">like looking at the deep archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.749" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">truth that exists within it which which</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.419" end="00:27:22.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really cross over necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:25.009" style="s2">with you know the Spanish Inquisition or</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.330" end="00:27:26.659" style="s2">what the Catholic Church is up to in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.009" end="00:27:29.899" style="s2">certain country yeah yeah and as</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.659" end="00:27:32.049" style="s2">Peterson says Sam Harris in his books</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.899" end="00:27:34.279" style="s2">and his lectures doesn&#39;t grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.049" end="00:27:35.599" style="s2">Dostoyevsky doesn&#39;t grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.279" end="00:27:37.129" style="s2">Nietzsche doesn&#39;t grapple with these</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.599" end="00:27:39.799" style="s2">thinkers who wrestled with the human</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.129" end="00:27:42.169" style="s2">condition and often resorts to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.799" end="00:27:45.619" style="s2">caricature of religion that most</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.169" end="00:27:47.779" style="s2">religious people don&#39;t believe yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.619" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">Sam if you&#39;re watching and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.779" end="00:27:53.799" style="s2">respond to any of this you&#39;re more than</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:57.139" style="s2">welcome your publicist of my details so</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.799" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s look forward to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.139" end="00:28:02.379" style="s2">we&#39;ve got coming up and really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:05.299" style="s2">like I was I was very taken with some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.379" end="00:28:07.940" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s answers today particularly</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.299" end="00:28:09.619" style="s2">about the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.940" end="00:28:12.679" style="s2">individual and collective identity in</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.619" end="00:28:16.969" style="s2">the left which I&#39;ve never heard him mate</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.679" end="00:28:19.399" style="s2">before and this I think will be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.969" end="00:28:23.749" style="s2">centerpiece of what we&#39;re looking to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.399" end="00:28:27.799" style="s2">next week because there&#39;s a I&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.749" end="00:28:29.629" style="s2">few people on the left now really</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.799" end="00:28:31.219" style="s2">grappling with Jordan Peterson in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.629" end="00:28:32.190" style="s2">of sense of what does the left have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.219" end="00:28:35.520" style="s2">learn from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.190" end="00:28:38.850" style="s2">and that seems new to me for a while it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.520" end="00:28:40.170" style="s2">felt like most of there&#39;s obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.850" end="00:28:41.790" style="s2">radical death which hates women and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.170" end="00:28:43.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of it there&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.790" end="00:28:45.510" style="s2">the soft left which is really unsure</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.500" end="00:28:47.550" style="s2">about him and I had a sense for a while</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.510" end="00:28:52.800" style="s2">that they were just wanting him to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.550" end="00:28:55.020" style="s2">away and he hasn&#39;t been hey so now the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.800" end="00:28:56.400" style="s2">sense is okay and it&#39;s quite a brave</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.020" end="00:28:57.780" style="s2">thing for people on the left to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.400" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">that because there&#39;s he&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.780" end="00:29:03.720" style="s2">quite a kind of kind of polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:04.890" style="s2">figure and an hated figure by some area</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.720" end="00:29:06.030" style="s2">of the left so I would have kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.890" end="00:29:07.440" style="s2">acknowledged the bravery of the people</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.030" end="00:29:11.790" style="s2">on the Left who are engaging with his</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.440" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">thought and what we want to do next week</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.790" end="00:29:16.860" style="s2">is a whole series of programs looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:18.750" style="s2">what can the left learn from Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:20.970" style="s2">Peterson yeah and I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.750" end="00:29:22.650" style="s2">good timing I&#39;ve noticed that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.970" end="00:29:25.050" style="s2">something shifting on the left around</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.650" end="00:29:26.520" style="s2">identity politics in particular and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.050" end="00:29:31.350" style="s2">left kind of sorting its house out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.520" end="00:29:33.390" style="s2">then last night there&#39;s a now quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.350" end="00:29:34.590" style="s2">viral tweet of Barack Obama talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.390" end="00:29:38.670" style="s2">about effectively the dangers of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.590" end="00:29:40.710" style="s2">identity politics and specifically using</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.670" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">Mandela as an example of someone who was</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.710" end="00:29:45.420" style="s2">able to transcend that learned Afrikaans</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:47.310" style="s2">in prison really you know challenging</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.420" end="00:29:48.900" style="s2">and just disputing this idea of like oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.310" end="00:29:51.660" style="s2">if someone&#39;s you know for example white</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.900" end="00:29:53.400" style="s2">and male they can&#39;t possibly understand</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.660" end="00:29:56.220" style="s2">you or you know just bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.400" end="00:29:58.500" style="s2">empathy so Barack Obama bringing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.220" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">into the into the conversation I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.500" end="00:30:02.460" style="s2">that&#39;s quite a big moment so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:05.670" style="s2">there is a kind of shift happening and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.460" end="00:30:08.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a good time great and any</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.670" end="00:30:11.400" style="s2">housekeeping we&#39;ve got a we&#39;ve now</p>
