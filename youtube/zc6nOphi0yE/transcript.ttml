<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.710" style="s2">hey folks welcome to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.220" end="00:00:06.810" style="s2">podcast this is the sixth in a series of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.710" end="00:00:09.570" style="s2">live streams with dr. Heather Hahn</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.810" end="00:00:11.849" style="s2">sitting as always to my right we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.570" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">some interesting things to discuss with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.849" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">you today and it is in some sense an</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.870" end="00:00:20.369" style="s2">unusual podcast we will start with</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:23.240" style="s2">Corrections and then we will get to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.369" end="00:00:25.859" style="s2">part that is in many ways much more</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.240" end="00:00:27.810" style="s2">personal I should also add that we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.859" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">working on technical aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.810" end="00:00:32.840" style="s2">podcast and so anyway this is a painful</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:34.829" style="s2">process we are discovering all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.840" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">wrinkles that need to be ironed out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.829" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">our system hopefully we will have fewer</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">dropped frames today and better</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">continuity with the sound I will try to</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">remember to speak into the microphone</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">which sometimes I don&#39;t do when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">looking at my lovely wife so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.230" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">other observations that we ought to know</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.289" style="s2">about please don&#39;t be shy about sharing</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">them and we will attempt to refine this</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.289" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">process as we go all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">as far as Corrections go we have a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">things to discuss first I had a number</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:12.810" style="s2">of people tell me that we had it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">with respect to whether or not urine is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.810" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">sanitary and I would have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:20.520" style="s2">look at exactly what we said sterile was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">the word that we used sterile okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.520" end="00:01:24.630" style="s2">think the problem here there is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">correction that needs to be made which</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.630" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">is that it certainly can&#39;t be considered</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">sterile there are in fact things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">are transmitted in urine they tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:36.360" style="s2">difficult to transmit that way but they</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">have been cultured by people who have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.360" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">looked for it it&#39;s to say there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">bacterial load in your and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">bacteria in the bladder at some point it</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">was imagined that maybe there wasn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:49.590" style="s2">and and there&#39;s more bacteria in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">bladder and urine of people with current</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.590" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">urinary tract infections but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:58.200" style="s2">always some bacteria in even the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">healthiest urine the the issue though</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.200" end="00:02:06.329" style="s2">comes down to one of extremophiles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">evolution so while urine is not sterile</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.329" end="00:02:11.860" style="s2">it does have some sanitizing properties</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">by virtue of the high salt content</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.860" end="00:02:16.750" style="s2">and it is not that things cannot adapt</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:20.740" style="s2">to the high salt content clearly urinary</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.750" end="00:02:22.840" style="s2">tract infections manage it but it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.740" end="00:02:24.700" style="s2">difficult to evolve those things and to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:26.530" style="s2">the extent that things evolve resistance</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.700" end="00:02:28.210" style="s2">to extreme environments they have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.530" end="00:02:30.520" style="s2">difficult time with normal environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.210" end="00:02:34.450" style="s2">so there&#39;s a trade-off there and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.520" end="00:02:36.940" style="s2">explains why was the mass I who utilized</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.450" end="00:02:41.020" style="s2">cow urine to wash their hands there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.940" end="00:02:42.880" style="s2">some sanitizing capacity there so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.020" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2">partial correction in that case and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.880" end="00:02:47.110" style="s2">certainly more more useful as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:50.140" style="s2">sanitizer than any other bodily</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.110" end="00:02:52.420" style="s2">excretion I can stand out Wow</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.140" end="00:02:53.709" style="s2">okay well I mean I&#39;m gonna yes you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.420" end="00:02:56.260" style="s2">go gross with that but you could also</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.709" end="00:02:58.540" style="s2">say okay spit to spit work now right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.260" end="00:03:01.930" style="s2">you know anything blood no CC is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.540" end="00:03:05.200" style="s2">obviously not right okay good</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.930" end="00:03:09.310" style="s2">second some folks challenged me I I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.200" end="00:03:11.860" style="s2">asked what sort of preparatory materials</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.310" end="00:03:13.989" style="s2">did I leave when we moved out of Olympia</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.860" end="00:03:15.220" style="s2">and to Portland and I mentioned off the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.989" end="00:03:18.250" style="s2">top of my head</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.220" end="00:03:19.870" style="s2">compressed air and the tools that go</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.250" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">with it and I had said that this could</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.870" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">be useful in the event of a collapse</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:25.930" style="s2">scenario and many people said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:28.150" style="s2">terrible idea it&#39;s too hard to generate</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.930" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">the pressure and to an extent they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.150" end="00:03:35.320" style="s2">right and in fact we have switched over</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">to battery-powered tools which in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.320" end="00:03:39.670" style="s2">scenarios are just simply so far</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:42.459" style="s2">superior to air powered tools if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.670" end="00:03:45.850" style="s2">power goes out that it&#39;s no contest but</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.459" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">I would point out that there are many</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.850" end="00:03:50.440" style="s2">different collapse scenarios and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:52.390" style="s2">battery-powered tools are great if what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.440" end="00:03:54.820" style="s2">you have is a short-term collapse</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.390" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">scenario where things go back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.820" end="00:04:00.340" style="s2">after a few months let&#39;s say in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:03.010" style="s2">event that civilization actually came</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.340" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">apart your batteries would die your</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.010" end="00:04:07.480" style="s2">tools would become useless and there&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:09.489" style="s2">be no way to power them alternatively so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.480" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">it really depends on what scenario</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.489" end="00:04:12.519" style="s2">you&#39;re preparing for and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">difficult things for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.519" end="00:04:18.729" style="s2">interested in preparing for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:20.950" style="s2">unforeseen outcomes is trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.729" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">out what the kit is that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.950" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">assemble that covers you for the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:27.220" style="s2">number of scenarios and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:29.320" style="s2">that are belt-driven and can therefore</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.220" end="00:04:31.450" style="s2">be driven by something like a bicycle</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.320" end="00:04:32.710" style="s2">are desirable from that perspective even</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.450" end="00:04:34.420" style="s2">if they&#39;re not ideal from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.710" end="00:04:36.100" style="s2">perspective of actually the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.420" end="00:04:40.570" style="s2">work it takes to get power out of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.100" end="00:04:42.580" style="s2">tools all right third thing has to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.570" end="00:04:45.130" style="s2">with smallpox blankets and I said that</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.580" end="00:04:46.870" style="s2">the stories about smallpox blankets</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.130" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">being delivered to natives of the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.870" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">world were apocryphal and indeed they</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:54.700" style="s2">are when it comes to the conquistadors</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:56.200" style="s2">there are a couple of credible instances</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.700" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">where this took place on the American</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.200" end="00:05:00.220" style="s2">frontier where it is more often invoked</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:02.290" style="s2">it was apparently not a widespread</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.220" end="00:05:06.070" style="s2">practice it&#39;s not that this was</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.290" end="00:05:08.290" style="s2">something that accounted for the massive</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.070" end="00:05:10.090" style="s2">outbreak of smallpox across native</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.290" end="00:05:12.820" style="s2">populations that was just simply the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.090" end="00:05:14.980" style="s2">confrontation between this novel</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.820" end="00:05:18.210" style="s2">pathogen and a population that had no</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.980" end="00:05:20.350" style="s2">evolutionary preparedness for it but</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.210" end="00:05:21.760" style="s2">nonetheless there are a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.350" end="00:05:24.790" style="s2">credible instances it&#39;s well worth</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.760" end="00:05:27.850" style="s2">looking into and the final correction</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.790" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">though I&#39;ve got a few oh wow I have one</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.850" end="00:05:33.850" style="s2">more and then whatever list you have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:35.920" style="s2">final one has to do with the focus of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.850" end="00:05:39.580" style="s2">the last live stream was on the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.920" end="00:05:43.690" style="s2">of whether or not hypoxia and depletion</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:47.230" style="s2">of iron and porphyrin from hemoglobin</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.690" end="00:05:52.600" style="s2">was more credibly the cause of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.230" end="00:05:56.919" style="s2">symptoms in the kovat 19 then is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.600" end="00:05:58.900" style="s2">simple viral pneumonia and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.919" end="00:06:02.290" style="s2">a correction here I think what we said</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.900" end="00:06:05.230" style="s2">turns out to be important but what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.290" end="00:06:08.080" style="s2">has emerged is a tension between doctors</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.230" end="00:06:12.840" style="s2">who are seeing different things and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.080" end="00:06:15.220" style="s2">have doctors who are seeing the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.840" end="00:06:17.380" style="s2">failure of the blood to transport oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.220" end="00:06:18.850" style="s2">as a primary driving force and there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.380" end="00:06:21.160" style="s2">other doctors who say no in fact this</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.850" end="00:06:23.320" style="s2">really does look like pneumonia and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.160" end="00:06:27.550" style="s2">piece of evidence that I heard marshaled</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.320" end="00:06:30.940" style="s2">against the hypoxia argument or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.550" end="00:06:33.760" style="s2">primary hypoxia argument was that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:36.729" style="s2">dissolved oxygen in the plasma plasma is</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.760" end="00:06:38.380" style="s2">the blood absent the cells the plasma</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.729" end="00:06:39.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t carry very much oxygen but it</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.380" end="00:06:41.830" style="s2">carries some</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.370" end="00:06:44.470" style="s2">and we&#39;re it&#39;s simply the failure of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.830" end="00:06:46.780" style="s2">hemoglobin to be transporting oxygen you</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.470" end="00:06:48.520" style="s2">would expect the plasma oxygen levels to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">be normal and in fact they are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.520" end="00:06:51.910" style="s2">normal in the case of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.850" style="s2">doctors who are arguing against the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.910" end="00:06:57.430" style="s2">hypoxia as the the driving force here</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.850" end="00:06:59.830" style="s2">and the point is that is more consistent</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.430" end="00:07:02.199" style="s2">with oxygen failing to cross from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.830" end="00:07:04.600" style="s2">lungs into the bloodstream rather than</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.199" end="00:07:07.270" style="s2">the blood failing to carry oxygen yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.600" end="00:07:10.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a great illustration of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.270" end="00:07:13.060" style="s2">prediction that would appear to and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.780" end="00:07:14.770" style="s2">necessarily falsify but run counter to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.060" end="00:07:16.840" style="s2">what it was that we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.770" end="00:07:18.340" style="s2">right although the final thing I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.840" end="00:07:20.410" style="s2">about it is that these two things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.340" end="00:07:22.900" style="s2">not mutually exclusive and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.410" end="00:07:25.060" style="s2">mutually exclusive in two ways one it</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.900" end="00:07:27.669" style="s2">could be that kovat 19 causes both</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.060" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">problems right and so to decide that one</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.669" end="00:07:31.810" style="s2">is not the cause and the other is is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:33.610" style="s2">mistake in either case which is it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.810" end="00:07:35.410" style="s2">won&#39;t always be the case of course that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.610" end="00:07:37.810" style="s2">you can have two hypotheses that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.410" end="00:07:39.820" style="s2">mutually exclusive and it is cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.810" end="00:07:41.710" style="s2">when we have ones that are such that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.820" end="00:07:43.389" style="s2">when you falsify one whichever one is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.710" end="00:07:46.090" style="s2">left standing is the most likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.389" end="00:07:47.710" style="s2">true but in this case there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.090" end="00:07:51.430" style="s2">to expect there&#39;s a single mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.710" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">action right in fact what we have here</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.430" end="00:07:57.250" style="s2">is this is a classic for Biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:08:00.520" style="s2">thinking because consider the the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.250" end="00:08:04.360" style="s2">that kovat 19 or the virus that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.520" end="00:08:07.090" style="s2">causing the syndrome is is facing it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.360" end="00:08:09.099" style="s2">to get into a body which requires it to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.090" end="00:08:11.620" style="s2">invade human cells and then it has to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.099" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">spread cell to cell but the particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.620" end="00:08:16.300" style="s2">site that it invades and the cells that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">it skips to have a lot to say about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.300" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">symptomatology from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.539" style="s2">the patients and the doctors who are</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">seeing them so you shouldn&#39;t expect that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.539" end="00:08:27.370" style="s2">this virus causes one set of symptoms a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:29.470" style="s2">lot is contingent on the exact path it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.370" end="00:08:32.380" style="s2">took to get to the place where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.470" end="00:08:34.750" style="s2">doctor first sees the patient so it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.380" end="00:08:36.459" style="s2">actually quite likely that different</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.750" end="00:08:38.289" style="s2">doctors are seeing different things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.459" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">could be the result of genetic variation</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.289" end="00:08:44.529" style="s2">between strains of the virus or patients</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:47.020" style="s2">or patients or different developmental</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.529" end="00:08:49.600" style="s2">trajectories of the patients yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.020" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">this is this is the the lesson of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.600" end="00:08:54.630" style="s2">biology is that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">temptation to to simplify what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.630" end="00:08:59.280" style="s2">seeing is obviously important but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">very easy to take it too far in biology</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.280" end="00:09:06.440" style="s2">because complexity is you know is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:08.820" style="s2">present in every biological facet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.440" end="00:09:11.940" style="s2">okay so the Corrections that I had we</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.820" end="00:09:13.710" style="s2">already covered one about urine it turns</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.940" end="00:09:15.930" style="s2">out that eggs do have Salmonella inside</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.710" end="00:09:18.450" style="s2">of them because salmonella can actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.930" end="00:09:22.170" style="s2">is actually sometimes found in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.450" end="00:09:24.360" style="s2">cases in the ovaries of chickens and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.170" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">yes most the salmonella is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.360" end="00:09:28.170" style="s2">the surfaces of eggs and if you wash the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:30.120" style="s2">surface of your egg just before you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.170" end="00:09:32.340" style="s2">break it you are much more much less</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.120" end="00:09:34.470" style="s2">likely to get Salmonella but it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.340" end="00:09:36.840" style="s2">sometimes inside of the egg from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.470" end="00:09:39.870" style="s2">beginning which is news to me to me as</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.840" end="00:09:42.180" style="s2">well and then the final one was with</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:43.980" style="s2">regard to UV light and viral decay you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.180" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">would raised the question in life</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.980" end="00:09:47.460" style="s2">something I&#39;d said earlier about isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:49.340" style="s2">sunlight a great disinfectant and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.460" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">something to that effect and I&#39;d say no</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.340" end="00:09:56.960" style="s2">actually it seems like it&#39;s UVC that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">the best best route to to decaying</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.960" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">viruses and such and it turns out I had</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:05.310" style="s2">just received a paper that I had not yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:07.020" style="s2">read which called the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.310" end="00:10:09.090" style="s2">simulated sunlight on the inactivation</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.020" end="00:10:10.920" style="s2">of influenza virus and aerosol so this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.090" end="00:10:15.090" style="s2">has been influenza virus which is not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.920" end="00:10:17.580" style="s2">corona virus but it is a virus and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.090" end="00:10:21.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a simulation but what what they</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.580" end="00:10:23.700" style="s2">find is indeed that the half-life of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.030" end="00:10:26.370" style="s2">viruses of the influenza virus in a dark</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.700" end="00:10:28.470" style="s2">room is something like half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.370" end="00:10:31.230" style="s2">whereas in full intensity against</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">simulated sunlight it&#39;s two point four</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.230" end="00:10:34.770" style="s2">minutes two point four minutes is 0.4</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:37.170" style="s2">minutes compared to a half an hour for</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.770" end="00:10:39.090" style="s2">the half-life they&#39;re basically that how</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.170" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">long it takes for half of the virus to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.090" end="00:10:43.800" style="s2">decay and become inactive and capable of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:45.810" style="s2">being active in full sunlight</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.800" end="00:10:47.940" style="s2">well then I&#39;m proud to say that the Dark</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.810" end="00:10:50.220" style="s2">Horse podcast is the first place that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.940" end="00:10:54.060" style="s2">you will hear that simulated sunlight is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.220" end="00:10:56.730" style="s2">the best disinfectant yeah so it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.060" end="00:10:58.170" style="s2">interestingly this will be our topics</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.730" end="00:11:02.670" style="s2">today are going to be about death and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.170" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">also peer review and this is not related</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.670" end="00:11:08.790" style="s2">to the death topic but</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.740" style="s2">this article which is in the Journal of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.790" end="00:11:13.410" style="s2">infectious diseases is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.740" end="00:11:15.689" style="s2">published in 2020 but it is not it is it</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.410" end="00:11:17.579" style="s2">it went through peer review you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.689" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">over the last probably a year or two so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.579" end="00:11:20.879" style="s2">it just happens to have been published</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.779" end="00:11:24.629" style="s2">and you know in the in the log of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.879" end="00:11:27.059" style="s2">publication to to emerge just as this</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.629" end="00:11:28.050" style="s2">this global pandemic is hitting which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.059" end="00:11:29.819" style="s2">just an accident</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.050" end="00:11:32.249" style="s2">most of most everything that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.819" end="00:11:36.809" style="s2">hearing from scientific research right</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.249" end="00:11:38.189" style="s2">now about the SARS co2 and the disease</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.809" end="00:11:42.199" style="s2">it causes co19</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.189" end="00:11:44.730" style="s2">pandemic are on preprint servers and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.199" end="00:11:47.189" style="s2">have and are you know just coming out</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.730" end="00:11:49.759" style="s2">fast and furious and it&#39;s up to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.189" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">you know everyone basically to assess</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.759" end="00:11:55.860" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s it&#39;s true or not all</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:57.990" style="s2">right we will return to that topic when</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.860" end="00:12:01.529" style="s2">we get to the question of peer review</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.990" end="00:12:05.069" style="s2">later on yeah all right how would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.529" end="00:12:07.619" style="s2">like to you have something planned with</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.069" end="00:12:08.939" style="s2">respect to how we not exactly I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.619" end="00:12:11.429" style="s2">have some I have some things I want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.939" end="00:12:14.519" style="s2">say but if you if you wanted to start go</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.429" end="00:12:20.129" style="s2">for it yeah how about I do that so today</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.519" end="00:12:22.920" style="s2">is a somber day for us that is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.129" end="00:12:25.559" style="s2">anniversary of the death of Heather&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.920" end="00:12:29.029" style="s2">father seven seven years ago it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.559" end="00:12:32.759" style="s2">to believe it was seven years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.029" end="00:12:35.490" style="s2">Heather will say more about what took</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.759" end="00:12:38.309" style="s2">place and what it meant but I will just</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.490" end="00:12:41.730" style="s2">say for my part that Heather&#39;s father</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.309" end="00:12:44.850" style="s2">was an extremely unusual guy his name</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.730" end="00:12:47.129" style="s2">was Doug and he and I didn&#39;t get along</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.850" end="00:12:51.179" style="s2">perfectly at first I think that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.129" end="00:12:54.889" style="s2">of normal with you know father&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.179" end="00:12:57.480" style="s2">their daughters and their daughters</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.889" end="00:13:01.350" style="s2">would be boyfriends and all but</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.480" end="00:13:04.350" style="s2">ultimately we came to be quite close and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.350" end="00:13:06.779" style="s2">I must say I still in some sense have</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.350" end="00:13:09.959" style="s2">not reckoned my reconciled myself to his</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.779" end="00:13:12.209" style="s2">death he is somebody we comment on</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.959" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">frequently we given all that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.209" end="00:13:15.839" style="s2">through in the last few years we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">often wondered what he would make of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.839" end="00:13:21.870" style="s2">and we really wished we had his</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:24.270" style="s2">perspective he was a Heather will tell</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.870" end="00:13:26.220" style="s2">you more about his his professional</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.270" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">background but he was a computer</p>

<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:36.990" style="s2">by many which was interestingly we</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:39.480" style="s2">discovered that in the sense after he</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.990" end="00:13:41.490" style="s2">was gone when people told us what their</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.480" end="00:13:44.610" style="s2">relationships with him had been but he</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.490" end="00:13:46.230" style="s2">was a man of very few words he was an</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.610" end="00:13:49.110" style="s2">excellent teacher but it was not</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.230" end="00:13:52.200" style="s2">primarily about him telling you what to</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.410" end="00:14:02.130" style="s2">so we we miss him a great deal and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.470" end="00:14:06.990" style="s2">are very much still grappling with with</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.470" end="00:14:15.060" style="s2">Kovac 19 and it&#39;s possible that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:18.029" style="s2">are slightly fewer deaths from a few</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.060" end="00:14:22.530" style="s2">other sources because of the because of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.029" end="00:14:24.960" style="s2">the lockdown but by by unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.530" end="00:14:29.160" style="s2">happenstance there are two other deaths</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.160" end="00:14:32.940" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll say a few words about at</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.410" end="00:14:35.550" style="s2">least one of those at the end of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.940" end="00:14:37.170" style="s2">but knowing that this was coming that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.550" end="00:14:38.670" style="s2">were due to do another live stream on</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.170" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">the anniversary of my father&#39;s death I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.670" end="00:14:43.890" style="s2">was thinking about it in light of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:47.790" style="s2">it might tell us about what the deaths</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.890" end="00:14:51.150" style="s2">from coma 19 are doing to people and how</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.790" end="00:14:52.470" style="s2">particularly this disease which of</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.470" end="00:14:57.470" style="s2">having died seven years ago is affecting</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.710" end="00:15:00.030" style="s2">people in ways that is hard to quantify</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.470" end="00:15:01.950" style="s2">but pretty easy to qualify if you start</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.030" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">to put putting stories together did you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.950" end="00:15:04.860" style="s2">say that the two deaths in our world</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.890" style="s2">were not yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.860" end="00:15:10.080" style="s2">yeah we so far have have no one that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.890" end="00:15:11.910" style="s2">know directly you know there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.080" end="00:15:14.940" style="s2">of second-order you know we know of some</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.910" end="00:15:18.529" style="s2">academics and such who have died from</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.940" end="00:15:18.529" style="s2">coma nineteen but the two people who we</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.680" end="00:15:27.820" style="s2">who died are experienced deaths this</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.450" end="00:15:32.080" style="s2">week I had nothing to the Cova 19 so</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.820" end="00:15:38.440" style="s2">in 2012 Brett and I were both teaching</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.080" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">evergreen and it was an early spring</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.440" end="00:15:44.530" style="s2">morning and for some reason I&#39;d gotten</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:46.030" style="s2">up very very early and was building</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">curriculum for the day it was maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.030" end="00:15:50.980" style="s2">first week of Spring Quarter and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:53.350" style="s2">boys were asleep and Brett was asleep</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.980" end="00:15:55.240" style="s2">and my phone rang and normally I</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.350" end="00:15:59.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been up at six ten or so</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.240" end="00:16:01.690" style="s2">it was my mom and she said your dad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.860" end="00:16:02.620" style="s2">having a heart attack the paramedics are</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.690" end="00:16:04.120" style="s2">here I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what to</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.120" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">they had my parents had moved to Olympia</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.010" end="00:16:10.810" style="s2">the year before year-and-a-half before</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:15.490" style="s2">to be near us to be near us and their</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.810" end="00:16:18.280" style="s2">grandchildren and I ran upstairs to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.490" end="00:16:19.660" style="s2">changed and Brett woke up and said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.280" end="00:16:21.460" style="s2">breaking the kids were taking them I</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.660" end="00:16:23.260" style="s2">said now don&#39;t know we don&#39;t need to and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.460" end="00:16:26.350" style="s2">you said yeah no we need to take them</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.260" end="00:16:28.150" style="s2">over there and you drove you drive</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.350" end="00:16:31.270" style="s2">faster normal conditions but you drive</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.150" end="00:16:32.710" style="s2">as fast as I remember you you driving to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.270" end="00:16:34.300" style="s2">get to my parents house and there were</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.710" end="00:16:36.310" style="s2">three emergency vehicles in the driveway</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.300" end="00:16:38.890" style="s2">again it&#39;s long before dawn at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.310" end="00:16:42.880" style="s2">point and I said Brett stay in the car</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.890" end="00:16:44.710" style="s2">with the boys I&#39;m gonna run in and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:46.570" style="s2">wanted to see what I wanted to see what</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.710" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">the situation was our kids were at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.570" end="00:16:52.240" style="s2">point almost nine and seven and I just</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:55.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t want them walking in on a scene</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.240" end="00:16:57.400" style="s2">that was really gruesome and I went to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.720" end="00:17:00.850" style="s2">the door it was locked which was strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.400" end="00:17:03.880" style="s2">and I banged on it and my mom opened the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.850" end="00:17:07.480" style="s2">door and there&#39;s my dad like that was a</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.880" end="00:17:09.750" style="s2">big guy six-two and big I was on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.480" end="00:17:15.690" style="s2">floor and there were seven eight or nine</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.750" end="00:17:17.860" style="s2">first responders there EMTs and firemen</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.690" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">working on him and my mom was standing</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.860" end="00:17:25.449" style="s2">there with with the main guy and she</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:26.110" style="s2">came over to me and said he says your</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.449" end="00:17:28.540" style="s2">dad&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.110" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve been working on him for 20</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.540" end="00:17:38.200" style="s2">minutes and he&#39;s had no sign of life and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:39.670" style="s2">he&#39;s gone and I I started crying or</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.200" end="00:17:41.230" style="s2">hugged her and then there&#39;s a knock on</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.670" end="00:17:41.950" style="s2">the door and it&#39;s Brett with the boys</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.230" end="00:17:48.820" style="s2">whose</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.950" end="00:17:50.740" style="s2">he&#39;s come with them and the EMTs we</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.820" end="00:17:54.280" style="s2">opened the door and they see these two</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.740" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">children in the doorway and I tell them</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.280" end="00:18:00.100" style="s2">your grandfather&#39;s died and they start</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:01.990" style="s2">crying and the first responders keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.100" end="00:18:05.020" style="s2">working on my father and they bring him</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.990" end="00:18:07.830" style="s2">back they bring him back which is just</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.020" end="00:18:11.590" style="s2">extraordinary and it points to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.830" end="00:18:13.990" style="s2">connection that we have between us as</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.590" end="00:18:16.270" style="s2">human beings that sometimes is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.990" end="00:18:18.790" style="s2">difference between life and death now he</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.270" end="00:18:20.770" style="s2">had been out he had been without a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.790" end="00:18:22.300" style="s2">heartbeat for at least 20 minutes and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.770" end="00:18:23.800" style="s2">have no idea how much longer than that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.300" end="00:18:25.930" style="s2">it actually was because it took some</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.800" end="00:18:27.760" style="s2">time for them to arrive after my mother</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.930" end="00:18:31.930" style="s2">called them and she of course has no</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.760" end="00:18:38.100" style="s2">idea how long that actually was but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.930" end="00:18:41.350" style="s2">then got him to the hospital and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.100" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">Western medicine just did wondrous</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:45.880" style="s2">things for him over the next seven weeks</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:48.880" style="s2">in the ICU seven weeks in the ICU out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.880" end="00:18:51.550" style="s2">the ICU a few times but mostly in they</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.880" end="00:18:54.580" style="s2">put him into a cold coma they basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.550" end="00:18:56.410" style="s2">dropped his core temperature to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.580" end="00:18:58.240" style="s2">even remember what it was was like 92</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.410" end="00:19:00.220" style="s2">degrees I&#39;m I want to say but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.240" end="00:19:02.470" style="s2">remember I didn&#39;t look it up</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.220" end="00:19:06.100" style="s2">the idea being based on empirical</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.470" end="00:19:08.620" style="s2">results that people who died in people</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.100" end="00:19:11.230" style="s2">who almost drown in cold water tend to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.620" end="00:19:13.000" style="s2">have better results cognitively later on</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.230" end="00:19:16.170" style="s2">than people who almost drown in warm</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.000" end="00:19:18.610" style="s2">water that the slowing down of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.170" end="00:19:20.170" style="s2">slowing down of all biological and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.610" end="00:19:23.290" style="s2">chemical processes basically stops</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.170" end="00:19:24.550" style="s2">damage as well slows damage as well so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.290" end="00:19:26.980" style="s2">they put him into this cold coma</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.550" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">and the amazing cardiologist whom we</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.980" end="00:19:31.270" style="s2">spoke with in the hospital that morning</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.570" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2">said any outcome is possible you may</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.270" end="00:19:35.770" style="s2">never interact with him again and he may</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.360" end="00:19:36.310" style="s2">get up and walk away from this and be</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.770" end="00:19:38.770" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.310" end="00:19:40.300" style="s2">and we really can&#39;t say at least we</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.770" end="00:19:42.070" style="s2">can&#39;t make any predictions at all until</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.300" end="00:19:44.260" style="s2">we begin to pull him out of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.070" end="00:19:51.400" style="s2">medically induced cold comment 24 hours</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.260" end="00:19:53.380" style="s2">or so he was I wouldn&#39;t say just to jump</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.400" end="00:19:55.929" style="s2">forward not to tell the entire story</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.380" end="00:19:58.629" style="s2">here but I wouldn&#39;t say he</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.929" end="00:20:00.820" style="s2">was a hundred percent after he came out</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.629" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">of the ICU seven weeks later but he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.820" end="00:20:07.119" style="s2">really close and he went through bypass</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:09.159" style="s2">open heart bypass surgery he was on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.119" end="00:20:10.840" style="s2">heart-lung machine you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.159" end="00:20:12.730" style="s2">kind of medical intervention which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.840" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">extraordinary and saved my father&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.730" end="00:20:22.450" style="s2">a number of times during that spring of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:25.029" style="s2">2012 was was remarkable and so I must</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.450" end="00:20:27.970" style="s2">say I was never sure whether the little</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.029" end="00:20:31.299" style="s2">bit that he didn&#39;t seem to come back was</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.970" end="00:20:33.249" style="s2">the fact that he was so shaken by what</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.299" end="00:20:35.529" style="s2">had happened to him and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.249" end="00:20:36.700" style="s2">you can imagine being in his shoes you</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.529" end="00:20:39.129" style="s2">would always every time you forgot</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.700" end="00:20:41.769" style="s2">something you would wonder was that some</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.129" end="00:20:44.289" style="s2">capacity I lost so he there was a way in</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.360" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">and he and I shared maybe eight minutes</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.020" end="00:24:47.990" style="s2">of conversation during which time I told</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:49.180" style="s2">him I loved him and he told me he loved</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.560" end="00:25:30.680" style="s2">and I&#39;m Brett and our two children were</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.890" end="00:25:34.210" style="s2">around him as he as he died and were</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.680" end="00:25:39.050" style="s2">able to be in the room you know terrible</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.210" end="00:25:42.110" style="s2">ICU room for an hour or so afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.050" end="00:25:45.890" style="s2">and then we later I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.110" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">days later accompanied his body to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.890" end="00:25:52.370" style="s2">crematorium he had been Catholic in sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:26:00.380" style="s2">of a past life but but he had no</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.370" end="00:26:03.710" style="s2">objection to that ending for him and in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.380" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">his ending I thought this is how no one</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.710" end="00:26:07.480" style="s2">wants to die ever</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:09.770" style="s2">no one wants to die in the hospital</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.480" end="00:26:13.250" style="s2">Americans don&#39;t know how to die we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.770" end="00:26:16.370" style="s2">lost track of most of our most of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.250" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">ancient rituals every society that has</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.370" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">been looked at every culture that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:22.520" style="s2">looking at has death rituals and to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:25.220" style="s2">extent that individuals are still from</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.520" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">cultures that do or have created some</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.220" end="00:26:32.330" style="s2">for their themselves our our</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:35.130" style="s2">governmental and medical establishment</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.330" end="00:26:40.590" style="s2">has mostly kept us from those rituals</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.130" end="00:26:42.630" style="s2">under times of extreme duress and he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.590" end="00:26:44.519" style="s2">luckier than most because he had five</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.630" end="00:26:46.529" style="s2">they let the children into the ICU</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.519" end="00:26:49.529" style="s2">because it was the end which normally</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.529" end="00:26:51.149" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t have done and so he had</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.529" end="00:26:52.289" style="s2">five people around him who loved him</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.149" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.289" end="00:26:57.950" style="s2">but people dying of Kovan 19 generally</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:27:04.350" style="s2">don&#39;t have that at all and that loss of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.950" end="00:27:07.230" style="s2">contact between between humans is so</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.350" end="00:27:08.389" style="s2">profound and so extreme and it must be</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.230" end="00:27:12.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.389" end="00:27:14.220" style="s2">alienating and isolating and lonely it</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.600" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">feels like there must be something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.220" end="00:27:20.879" style="s2">we can do to make better deaths not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.730" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">now in this in this time of global</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.879" end="00:27:27.659" style="s2">pandemic but across all deaths yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:30.179" style="s2">really a difficult problem too because</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.659" end="00:27:32.460" style="s2">so many deaths now take place in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.179" end="00:27:34.200" style="s2">hospital and obviously at this moment if</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.460" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">you can avoid being in the hospital it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.200" end="00:27:38.940" style="s2">exactly the last place you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">just from the perspective of catching</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.940" end="00:27:46.049" style="s2">this virus so yeah you know obviously it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:48.600" style="s2">can&#39;t be the same priority level as</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.049" end="00:27:50.820" style="s2">figuring out how to treat people and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.600" end="00:27:53.519" style="s2">prevent them from dying but there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.820" end="00:27:55.470" style="s2">going to be deaths and you know even</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.519" end="00:27:57.990" style="s2">deaths from other things under these</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.470" end="00:28:01.019" style="s2">circumstances are just so compromised by</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.990" end="00:28:03.299" style="s2">the regulations around who can be where</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.019" end="00:28:07.169" style="s2">yeah I had it it doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.299" end="00:28:11.100" style="s2">addressed I have a interesting list here</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.169" end="00:28:13.559" style="s2">of ways that ways that death is</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.100" end="00:28:16.429" style="s2">celebrated just it&#39;s from its from the</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.230" end="00:29:03.900" style="s2">right there</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.799" end="00:29:05.850" style="s2">that we have come up with so many you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.900" end="00:29:08.630" style="s2">know what for every single one of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.850" end="00:29:11.340" style="s2">some of those sound crazy yeah and for</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.630" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">someone on earth whatever sounds crazy</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.340" end="00:29:15.570" style="s2">to every to the rest of us it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">the most natural thing in the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.570" end="00:29:19.679" style="s2">yeah but everywhere there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.240" style="s2">everywhere there&#39;s something everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.679" end="00:29:22.740" style="s2">there&#39;s something it&#39;s a human Universal</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.240" end="00:29:24.990" style="s2">Earth rituals are almost ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.740" end="00:29:29.220" style="s2">death rituals seemed to be ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.990" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">yeah and uh our culture has done so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.220" end="00:29:34.529" style="s2">to turn them generic and to sanitize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:37.970" style="s2">process and to turn it into a commodity</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.529" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s frightening yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.970" end="00:29:44.220" style="s2">alright is there more to say you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:46.950" style="s2">on this topic I think there there may</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.220" end="00:29:49.289" style="s2">well be more but maybe we maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.950" end="00:29:53.720" style="s2">stopped caring for now did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.289" end="00:29:53.720" style="s2">say what&#39;s up thank you no it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.960" end="00:30:02.149" style="s2">yeah maybe let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.740" end="00:30:04.289" style="s2">okay all right so the other topic is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.149" end="00:30:07.470" style="s2">it&#39;s tempting to try to find a</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.289" end="00:30:09.090" style="s2">connection between death and peer review</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.470" end="00:30:11.130" style="s2">here our view is sometimes the death of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.090" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">good idea yes it&#39;s where good ideas go</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.130" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">to die but in any case I wanted to raise</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:20.270" style="s2">an issue with respect to peer review</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:24.360" style="s2">because of what I&#39;m seeing unfold which</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.270" end="00:30:26.370" style="s2">is a very very unusual circumstance so</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.360" end="00:30:28.380" style="s2">for those of you who are not academics</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.370" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">and have not been academics there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.380" end="00:30:34.230" style="s2">part of the world of how science and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:36.929" style="s2">other disciplines unfold that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.230" end="00:30:39.929" style="s2">see and you probably can&#39;t into it</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.929" end="00:30:41.730" style="s2">which is that well there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.929" end="00:30:44.700" style="s2">principle called the Matthew principle</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.730" end="00:30:48.210" style="s2">which is something to the effect of to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.700" end="00:30:51.000" style="s2">those with much much is given the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.210" end="00:30:53.250" style="s2">being a positive feedback loop where</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.000" end="00:30:54.659" style="s2">those who have lots of something end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.250" end="00:30:58.289" style="s2">with more and those who have little end</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.659" end="00:31:01.789" style="s2">up with less this is found across our</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.289" end="00:31:04.580" style="s2">system there are amplifiers that take</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.789" end="00:31:07.669" style="s2">parities and increase them and one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.580" end="00:31:12.259" style="s2">the places that this happens is in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.669" end="00:31:14.509" style="s2">of academic access so at a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.259" end="00:31:17.809" style="s2">high-powered university you will have</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.509" end="00:31:19.909" style="s2">incredible access to what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.809" end="00:31:21.109" style="s2">literature alright your library will</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.909" end="00:31:23.419" style="s2">have a great many of those things</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.109" end="00:31:25.489" style="s2">available to you and there&#39;s ways to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.419" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">access any that aren&#39;t present in your</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.489" end="00:31:29.509" style="s2">library and you sort of come to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:31.009" style="s2">this is just the nature of the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.509" end="00:31:32.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve now joined a field you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.009" end="00:31:35.029" style="s2">access to all the things to take place</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.570" end="00:31:37.669" style="s2">and it turns out that as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.029" end="00:31:40.519" style="s2">leave a major university even if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.669" end="00:31:42.499" style="s2">step to a just somewhat less renowned</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.519" end="00:31:44.840" style="s2">place you discover a spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.499" end="00:31:46.849" style="s2">decrease in what you have access to and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.840" end="00:31:48.769" style="s2">if you go to a college you find that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.849" end="00:31:51.169" style="s2">your access plummets and if you leave</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.769" end="00:31:53.359" style="s2">academia altogether you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.169" end="00:31:55.489" style="s2">facing a paywall that&#39;s asking you to</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.359" end="00:31:57.349" style="s2">pay thirty five bucks to glimpse a paper</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.489" end="00:31:59.479" style="s2">that you just need to look at a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.349" end="00:32:02.989" style="s2">bit to figure out whether some result</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.479" end="00:32:04.879" style="s2">makes sense so anyway there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.989" end="00:32:06.529" style="s2">with peer review that begins with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.879" end="00:32:10.820" style="s2">fact that it is a gate through which</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.529" end="00:32:12.710" style="s2">most people cannot pass hey folks sorry</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.820" end="00:32:15.349" style="s2">about that we had some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.710" end="00:32:17.869" style="s2">momentary power failure that took out</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.349" end="00:32:19.190" style="s2">cameras computer everything associated</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.869" end="00:32:20.599" style="s2">with the podcast and it took us a moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.190" end="00:32:22.879" style="s2">to get back I&#39;ve got a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.599" end="00:32:24.619" style="s2">hypothesis oh is that right yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.879" end="00:32:27.320" style="s2">the editors at Nature what took us out</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.619" end="00:32:28.849" style="s2">the editors at nature what took us out I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.320" end="00:32:31.489" style="s2">like that I thought this is and I like</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.849" end="00:32:34.549" style="s2">the phrasing of it thank you all right</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.489" end="00:32:36.619" style="s2">well here we an apologies I think what</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.549" end="00:32:40.009" style="s2">we will do is we will have this second</p>

<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:52.940" style="s2">finish up what I was getting at the fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.330" end="00:32:55.940" style="s2">of the literature being available in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.940" end="00:33:00.590" style="s2">proportion to the prestige of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.940" end="00:33:05.090" style="s2">University is a hidden fact about about</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.590" end="00:33:11.090" style="s2">the way peer-review works but there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.090" end="00:33:12.769" style="s2">another set of facts that is equal sorry</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.090" end="00:33:14.840" style="s2">there are things being done here to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.769" end="00:33:15.620" style="s2">resurrect the stream amazing tactical</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.000" end="00:33:26.929" style="s2">think we&#39;ve got it okay all right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.309" end="00:33:28.909" style="s2">here&#39;s what I want to get it I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.929" end="00:33:34.070" style="s2">cut to the chase so that is it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.909" end="00:33:37.730" style="s2">face another set of problems the Cova</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.070" end="00:33:40.010" style="s2">Dean situation is revealing something</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.730" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a kind of test of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.010" end="00:33:47.450" style="s2">something that we have been talking</p>

<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:18.409" style="s2">peers need to have veto power on whether</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.230" end="00:35:16.430" style="s2">is that we can behave so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.730" end="00:35:19.580" style="s2">catch it all of these things this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.430" end="00:35:21.770" style="s2">unfolding outside of peer review there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.580" end="00:35:24.830" style="s2">no time for the journals to send these</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.770" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">papers out and have peers review the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.830" end="00:35:28.040" style="s2">work and decide whether or not it could</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:28.700" style="s2">be published there&#39;s no time to publish</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.040" end="00:35:30.890" style="s2">it on paper</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.700" end="00:35:32.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s unfolding on these preprint</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.890" end="00:35:34.670" style="s2">servers and what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.599" end="00:35:36.619" style="s2">people are putting up papers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.670" end="00:35:37.339" style="s2">accessible to anybody with an internet</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.619" end="00:35:39.680" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.339" end="00:35:40.910" style="s2">they vary a tremendous amount or not I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2">don&#39;t think any of the preprint servers</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.910" end="00:35:45.560" style="s2">are behind a paywall right yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.640" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">you know the preprint servers weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.560" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">really designed for this purpose the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">preprint servers were designed in effect</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.170" style="s2">so that anybody could lodge an idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:35:56.630" style="s2">irrespective of where they were in peer</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.170" end="00:36:00.980" style="s2">review and later on you could see it so</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.630" end="00:36:03.829" style="s2">immediate access was important and and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.980" end="00:36:05.660" style="s2">such things but very often they actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.829" end="00:36:07.070" style="s2">are limited in terms of who can use them</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.660" end="00:36:09.380" style="s2">in other words you have to be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.070" end="00:36:11.480" style="s2">member in good standing within a field</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.380" end="00:36:13.579" style="s2">or something like this but that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.480" end="00:36:19.369" style="s2">neither here nor there the important</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.579" end="00:36:21.800" style="s2">point is that these papers are emerging</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.369" end="00:36:24.260" style="s2">in real time every day there are new</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.800" end="00:36:26.869" style="s2">papers available that discussed the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.260" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">mechanisms at work with the virus the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.869" end="00:36:31.880" style="s2">symptomatology of the patients the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:34.430" style="s2">epidemiology all of these things they</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.880" end="00:36:36.770" style="s2">are accessible to anyone most of us do</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.430" end="00:36:38.329" style="s2">not know who these authors are so these</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.770" end="00:36:39.920" style="s2">things are now being broadcast to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.329" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">something much larger than a field</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.920" end="00:36:42.980" style="s2">they&#39;re being broadcast to anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:45.790" style="s2">has a scientific interest in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.980" end="00:36:49.790" style="s2">understanding how this thing works and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.790" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">it is effectively the proof that this</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.790" end="00:36:57.130" style="s2">does function that the fact of no</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:59.780" style="s2">quality control on these things is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.130" end="00:37:02.569" style="s2">creating a hazard it&#39;s creating an</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">opportunity that we can now you the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.569" end="00:37:06.859" style="s2">public if you want to can tune in to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.990" style="s2">dialog between you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.859" end="00:37:10.490" style="s2">doctors who are seeing symptoms that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.990" end="00:37:14.060" style="s2">somewhat inconsistent with each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.490" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">you can tune in as the viral adjusts are</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.060" end="00:37:18.650" style="s2">discussing the similarities of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:21.849" style="s2">receptor molecules in one virus versus</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.650" end="00:37:23.960" style="s2">another and the fact that this works is</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.849" end="00:37:27.740" style="s2">tremendously important and what I very</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.960" end="00:37:31.339" style="s2">much hope is that at the end of the Cova</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.740" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">dean situation that we do not simply</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.339" end="00:37:35.839" style="s2">decide that peer review has to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:38.510" style="s2">re-established as the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.839" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">maintain quality what I hope is that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.510" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">will recognize that we&#39;ve discovered</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:44.610" style="s2">that in fact peer review is</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:47.880" style="s2">the abomination many of us think it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.610" end="00:37:50.790" style="s2">and that it should be replaced by some</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.880" end="00:37:56.490" style="s2">sort of open-source alternative yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.790" end="00:37:57.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a route there&#39;s a related Thank</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.490" end="00:37:59.790" style="s2">You Zack</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.740" end="00:38:01.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a related issue I&#39;m not actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.790" end="00:38:04.650" style="s2">sure might be interesting to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.860" end="00:38:05.490" style="s2">to here with you live how exactly you</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.650" end="00:38:10.440" style="s2">think at enter place but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.490" end="00:38:12.540" style="s2">related issue that you alluded to with</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.440" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">regard to our one universities you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.540" end="00:38:17.580" style="s2">the big research universities with with</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:19.380" style="s2">a lot of funding have the gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.580" end="00:38:21.690" style="s2">in terms of journal access and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.380" end="00:38:24.000" style="s2">a faculty or a student at one of those</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.690" end="00:38:25.470" style="s2">universities it&#39;s invisible to you once</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.000" end="00:38:28.290" style="s2">you know how to use the system it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.470" end="00:38:29.730" style="s2">it just slides right through and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.290" end="00:38:31.170" style="s2">know in fact this paper that I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.730" end="00:38:33.360" style="s2">at the beginning of the first live</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.170" end="00:38:34.670" style="s2">stream the influence of simulated</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.360" end="00:38:37.260" style="s2">sunlight on the inactivation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.670" end="00:38:38.670" style="s2">influenza virus and era cells that came</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.260" end="00:38:41.460" style="s2">to us through Princeton you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.670" end="00:38:44.580" style="s2">it&#39;s so easy we haven&#39;t we now for right</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.460" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">now have this this our one university</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.580" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">level access and all you have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:50.190" style="s2">ask you have to you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:52.920" style="s2">find it but then but then you just a</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.190" end="00:38:56.430" style="s2">scan it and it shows up for you so</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.920" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a maintaining of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.430" end="00:39:00.120" style="s2">status quo by virtue of the fact that if</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:01.410" style="s2">you&#39;re at one of these places you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.120" end="00:39:02.520" style="s2">access to the literature and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.410" end="00:39:03.600" style="s2">not at one of these places you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.520" end="00:39:06.060" style="s2">have access you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.600" end="00:39:08.340" style="s2">missing and it&#39;s very hard to jump into</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.060" end="00:39:09.720" style="s2">even knowing what it is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.340" end="00:39:13.590" style="s2">missing and therefore what to ask for</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.720" end="00:39:15.300" style="s2">so when we were at Evergreen which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.590" end="00:39:18.870" style="s2">you know a public liberal arts college</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.300" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">and was was once capable of doing very</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.870" end="00:39:24.510" style="s2">high quality work at the both the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:27.120" style="s2">faculty and the student level one of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.510" end="00:39:30.690" style="s2">soap boxes the entire time that we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.120" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">there was trying to get access to mostly</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.690" end="00:39:33.540" style="s2">news web of science which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.810" style="s2">the science Citation Index which is this</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.540" end="00:39:38.970" style="s2">indexing database that indexes so many</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.810" end="00:39:41.400" style="s2">journals you know across a wide array of</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.970" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">field is mostly Natural Sciences actual</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.400" end="00:39:45.150" style="s2">and physical sciences but and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:48.140" style="s2">full-text database you can&#39;t from there</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.150" end="00:39:51.180" style="s2">get to get to all of the full-text but</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.140" end="00:39:54.030" style="s2">by learning how to use its search</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.180" end="00:39:55.589" style="s2">function well you really confine you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.030" end="00:39:56.819" style="s2">do the lit review you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.589" end="00:39:59.640" style="s2">getting the lit review that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.819" end="00:40:02.039" style="s2">needs to be able to do but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.640" end="00:40:06.660" style="s2">expensive and evergreen was never rich</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.039" end="00:40:09.150" style="s2">and early in our tenure there I was able</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.660" end="00:40:11.369" style="s2">to convince the then library Dean to to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.150" end="00:40:12.930" style="s2">buy it for the school and I taught my</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.369" end="00:40:14.999" style="s2">students at every single quarter and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.930" end="00:40:18.119" style="s2">you know this is this is the access that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.999" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">you need and then it got cut a few years</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.119" end="00:40:24.749" style="s2">before we left half years before we did</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:25.739" style="s2">get cut and the argument made to me you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.749" end="00:40:27.960" style="s2">know obviously ultimately was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.739" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">financial argument it was expensive but</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.960" end="00:40:32.910" style="s2">the argument made to me by some of the</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.910" end="00:40:39.509" style="s2">there was basically as a researcher as a</p>

<p begin="00:40:39.509" end="00:40:42.989" style="s2">only a couple of journals that you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.219" end="00:40:44.969" style="s2">probably interested in looking at anyway</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.989" end="00:40:49.710" style="s2">what the hell do you need all this</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.969" end="00:40:52.890" style="s2">really broad access for and this to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.710" end="00:40:55.109" style="s2">is just an encapsulation of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.890" end="00:40:57.420" style="s2">things that is most wrong with with</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.109" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">higher ed now and not not just the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.420" end="00:41:01.229" style="s2">educational end of it but the research</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">and the idea that most people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.229" end="00:41:06.509" style="s2">research by being really really familiar</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:08.039" style="s2">with a couple of journals and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.509" end="00:41:10.950" style="s2">also get the tables of contents for</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.039" end="00:41:13.410" style="s2">Nature and Science and one or two other</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.950" end="00:41:15.809" style="s2">pretty big journals in in their inboxes</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.089" end="00:42:30.770" style="s2">they have to be able to review it</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.940" end="00:42:49.220" style="s2">they read it and they read it again and</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:51.230" style="s2">at first everyone&#39;s thought is almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.220" end="00:42:53.720" style="s2">everyone&#39;s thought is I can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.230" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">this I must be too dumb to understand it</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.920" end="00:43:06.020" style="s2">you know what maybe this is written in a</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.339" end="00:43:18.260" style="s2">well there are two things you have terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.460" end="00:43:19.880" style="s2">of art which are necessary in order to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.260" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">do the high quality work and then you</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.880" end="00:43:23.690" style="s2">have jargon which masquerade is terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:25.490" style="s2">art that are basically there just to</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.369" end="00:44:15.980" style="s2">his approach to things like debugging he</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.670" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">was definitely a no-nonsense yeah get it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.980" end="00:44:20.870" style="s2">unplugged kind of guy that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:24.890" style="s2">alright alright first Super chats</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.870" end="00:44:26.510" style="s2">spot-on Thank You Nate says a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.890" end="00:44:28.790" style="s2">about models specifically pertaining to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.510" end="00:44:30.650" style="s2">non regular non repeating events are</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.790" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">they predictive or do they serve a</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.650" end="00:44:34.010" style="s2">different purpose</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:36.520" style="s2">if predictive how do they derive an</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.010" end="00:44:39.470" style="s2">ought the future from an is a present</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.520" end="00:44:41.540" style="s2">it&#39;s just an inductive versus deductive</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.470" end="00:44:46.520" style="s2">question is that what he&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.540" end="00:44:48.920" style="s2">maybe maybe so I mean there they claim</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.520" end="00:44:50.540" style="s2">they&#39;re predictive of course but is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.920" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">is it inductive versity doctor I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.540" end="00:44:54.350" style="s2">sure here&#39;s what I wish I knew which of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">these mics was picking us up yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.350" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">not sure I&#39;m not sure what the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:45:00.490" style="s2">means but I have the sense that this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:03.140" style="s2">this is the answer you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.490" end="00:45:07.420" style="s2">unfortunately models are being abused</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.140" end="00:45:09.830" style="s2">they are taken to be reflective of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.420" end="00:45:12.350" style="s2">things that are being modeled and in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.830" end="00:45:14.330" style="s2">complex system it&#39;s very hard to get the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.350" end="00:45:16.010" style="s2">model right enough and it is very easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.330" end="00:45:18.770" style="s2">to fool yourself into thinking that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.010" end="00:45:20.900" style="s2">have the model right enough so what I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.770" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">would argue is that the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.900" end="00:45:27.320" style="s2">science logically applied to models</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:29.840" style="s2">suggest that models can be valid places</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.320" end="00:45:31.970" style="s2">to generate hypotheses which then need</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.840" end="00:45:35.060" style="s2">to be tested against nature they are not</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.970" end="00:45:37.100" style="s2">valid tests of hypotheses I can&#39;t say no</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.060" end="00:45:39.470" style="s2">model ever has been you had obviously in</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.100" end="00:45:42.380" style="s2">a very simple scenario build a model in</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.470" end="00:45:44.870" style="s2">which you can test the hypothesis but in</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.380" end="00:45:46.910" style="s2">a complex system they are valid ways to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.870" end="00:45:48.860" style="s2">generate hypotheses you may be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.910" end="00:45:51.170" style="s2">observe something in a model that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.860" end="00:45:52.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t expect but you can&#39;t test things</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.170" end="00:45:59.900" style="s2">there and that&#39;s I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.760" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">doing wrong good fellow biologist and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.900" end="00:46:02.420" style="s2">academic here</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:04.280" style="s2">what is your take on dr. David</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.420" end="00:46:06.050" style="s2">Sinclair&#39;s information theory of aging</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.280" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">as well as his and Aubrey de Grey</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.050" end="00:46:09.260" style="s2">approach to combat senescence and aging</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:12.260" style="s2">love you guys</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.260" end="00:46:18.550" style="s2">wonderful Johan I sure hope the audio is</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.260" end="00:46:18.550" style="s2">on for this ok out of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.900" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">okay great all right David Sinclair&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.349" end="00:46:28.329" style="s2">informational theory of aging I believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:31.660" style="s2">now I&#39;m not thoroughly versed in David</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.329" end="00:46:34.630" style="s2">Sinclair&#39;s probably it&#39;s a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.660" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">and not a theory what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.630" end="00:46:41.079" style="s2">that in my paper on telomeres I advanced</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:44.700" style="s2">what I believe to be the same hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.079" end="00:46:47.859" style="s2">I made an error which is that I used a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.700" end="00:46:49.710" style="s2">term which I now know would have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.859" end="00:46:52.900" style="s2">better replaced with another term I said</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.710" end="00:46:55.089" style="s2">histological entropy which many people</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.900" end="00:46:57.999" style="s2">took to be an analogue for normal</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.089" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">entropy what I should have said was</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.999" end="00:47:02.950" style="s2">epigenetic entropy so what do you I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:04.390" style="s2">I I loved that phrase histological</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.950" end="00:47:06.670" style="s2">entropy as you know but what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.390" end="00:47:09.009" style="s2">by it for those what I&#39;m what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.670" end="00:47:12.549" style="s2">it is if you look at the way development</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.009" end="00:47:15.279" style="s2">unfolds cells know what to do that is to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.549" end="00:47:18.849" style="s2">say they know which of their genes to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.279" end="00:47:21.069" style="s2">transcribe based on two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.849" end="00:47:23.619" style="s2">information based on a history of what</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.069" end="00:47:26.079" style="s2">cells they came from that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.619" end="00:47:27.999" style="s2">their lineage and information from</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.079" end="00:47:32.349" style="s2">things like neighbors that says where</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.999" end="00:47:36.450" style="s2">they are as you get old they lose track</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.349" end="00:47:40.059" style="s2">of these kinds of information because a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.450" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">they are no longer the next cell in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.059" end="00:47:45.249" style="s2">logical sequence from development what</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">they many of them are is cells ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.249" end="00:47:50.349" style="s2">that have stepped in to replace a cell</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:52.509" style="s2">that was lost due to damage or wearing</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.349" end="00:47:56.769" style="s2">out and so the amount of information</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.509" end="00:47:59.499" style="s2">about where a cell is is reduced based</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.769" end="00:48:01.509" style="s2">on basically in increasingly bad</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.499" end="00:48:03.549" style="s2">information and that bad information</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.509" end="00:48:05.259" style="s2">compounds because of the sent to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.549" end="00:48:06.730" style="s2">extent that one cell is confused it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.259" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">putting out a confusing message to all</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.730" end="00:48:11.319" style="s2">of its neighbors and so what you get is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:14.140" style="s2">informational breakdown of the natural</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.510" end="00:48:33.540" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t normally show up yep</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.100" end="00:48:34.860" style="s2">right and not just you know during</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.540" end="00:48:37.260" style="s2">puberty you get secondary sex</p>

<p begin="00:48:46.170" end="00:48:53.160" style="s2">this is I think a realization of this</p>

<p begin="00:48:53.160" end="00:48:56.730" style="s2">original example was a hair follicle out</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.560" end="00:49:03.090" style="s2">clear your paper predates Sinclair&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.170" end="00:49:04.410" style="s2">it comes after well it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.090" end="00:49:06.420" style="s2">he wrote something much earlier but I</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.410" end="00:49:10.050" style="s2">don&#39;t think so I think mine is far</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.420" end="00:49:12.120" style="s2">earlier and that I wish I had called it</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.050" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">epigenetic entropy I think it would have</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.120" end="00:49:18.600" style="s2">been much clearer histological entropy</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:20.940" style="s2">is I think a very valid term but it it</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.600" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">did lead some people to misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.940" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2">what was being said and what about</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:29.790" style="s2">degree what about what about Aubrey de</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:32.310" style="s2">Grey Aubrey de Grey is perspective I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.790" end="00:49:36.300" style="s2">basically just repeating what he has</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.310" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">said is that the failure of the human</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.300" end="00:49:40.860" style="s2">body due to senescence is effectively an</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:42.270" style="s2">engineering problem and that if it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.860" end="00:49:43.860" style="s2">addressed as an engineering problem it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.270" end="00:49:45.960" style="s2">has a small number of causes and then if</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.860" end="00:49:48.770" style="s2">we address those causes one by one lo</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.960" end="00:49:50.970" style="s2">and behold we will defeat aging and I</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:49:54.300" style="s2">agree with him that if you do to feed</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.970" end="00:49:56.970" style="s2">aging that living a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.300" end="00:49:59.910" style="s2">becomes readily within shooting distance</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.970" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">where we disagree is that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.910" end="00:50:03.570" style="s2">it may technically be an engineering</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:06.860" style="s2">problem has anything to say about how</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.570" end="00:50:09.930" style="s2">tractable it is and in fact years ago</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.860" end="00:50:13.260" style="s2">technology review out of MIT ran a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.930" end="00:50:16.020" style="s2">contest for any academic who could show</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.260" end="00:50:19.350" style="s2">that de Grey was not worth taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.020" end="00:50:20.730" style="s2">seriously and I did not yet have my PhD</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.350" end="00:50:23.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I was taken very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.730" end="00:50:25.890" style="s2">by the judges but my point oh I did</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.250" end="00:50:28.010" style="s2">submit one and my point was okay so</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.890" end="00:50:30.390" style="s2">aging is an engineering problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.010" end="00:50:34.830" style="s2">here&#39;s another engineering problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.390" end="00:50:36.930" style="s2">taking a 1965 Ford Mustang and allowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.830" end="00:50:38.940" style="s2">it to trans people transport people to</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.930" end="00:50:40.920" style="s2">the moon without ever taking it out of</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.120" end="00:50:50.390" style="s2">Apollo 11 or something like that and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">point is yeah that&#39;s an engineering</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.390" end="00:50:56.530" style="s2">problem it&#39;s just not tractable yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">my basic opinion is that barber degre</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.530" end="00:51:06.230" style="s2">has led us to a kind of false optimism</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:09.020" style="s2">about how tractable this problem is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.230" end="00:51:13.580" style="s2">also in my response to him took him to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.020" end="00:51:16.010" style="s2">task for having essentially no plan for</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.580" end="00:51:18.980" style="s2">addressing the informational breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.010" end="00:51:21.710" style="s2">of the mind that even if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.980" end="00:51:24.530" style="s2">solve all of the cellular aging and</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.710" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">tissue aging problems of the body you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.530" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">have another kind of problem which is</p>

<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:34.280" style="s2">function for a thousand years so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.550" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">know how much do you remember as a young</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.280" end="00:51:38.540" style="s2">person if you&#39;re planning to live a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:40.310" style="s2">thousand years you may be so forgetful</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.540" end="00:51:42.260" style="s2">as a young person that it&#39;s not worth it</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.310" end="00:51:45.080" style="s2">that&#39;s right the algorithms that work</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.260" end="00:51:47.300" style="s2">for memory for an 80 200 year old</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.080" end="00:51:51.380" style="s2">lifespan will be very very different</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.300" end="00:51:53.750" style="s2">yeah if the primary treatment is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.380" end="00:51:55.490" style="s2">ventilators which are 20% effective why</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.750" end="00:51:58.130" style="s2">do models show massive deaths in an</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.900" end="00:52:09.560" style="s2">more time yeah I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.090" end="00:52:10.940" style="s2">there&#39;s I think that there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.560" end="00:52:13.730" style="s2">logical leaps here that don&#39;t quite</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.090" end="00:52:32.540" style="s2">feel like maybe there&#39;s just some words</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.740" end="00:52:35.000" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not logical leaps but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.540" end="00:52:37.010" style="s2">quite tracking what the question is I</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.000" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">mean the primary treatment seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.010" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">ventilators which is we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:46.220" style="s2">last time may not be the right the right</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.540" end="00:52:52.070" style="s2">coming from I&#39;ve heard you know in some</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.970" end="00:52:55.060" style="s2">countries once you put on a ventilator</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.070" end="00:52:58.030" style="s2">it seems like you got a 50/50 chance</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.060" end="00:52:59.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve not heard 80% of people who go on</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.030" end="00:53:01.240" style="s2">ventilators end up dying so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.680" end="00:53:06.190" style="s2">what the measure of efficacy here would</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.240" end="00:53:08.740" style="s2">be and then you know ventilators versus</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.190" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">overrun you have something more here I</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.740" end="00:53:14.050" style="s2">don&#39;t really I think I think at some</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:15.850" style="s2">level the question comes down to if the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.050" end="00:53:19.750" style="s2">failure of the system because it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.850" end="00:53:21.550" style="s2">loaded is the cause of death then we</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.750" end="00:53:24.220" style="s2">should be able to estimate the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.550" end="00:53:29.080" style="s2">which we have a higher residual than</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.220" end="00:53:31.900" style="s2">expected based on how many ventilators</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.900" end="00:53:35.500" style="s2">don&#39;t quite get how maybe I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.060" end="00:53:37.300" style="s2">misunderstanding yes/no and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.500" end="00:53:40.930" style="s2">there&#39;s another interpretation there</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.300" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2">that if if the tool that you get in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.930" end="00:53:45.220" style="s2">hospital if the major treatment is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.570" end="00:53:47.140" style="s2">ventilator and it&#39;s not very effective</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.220" end="00:53:50.410" style="s2">and you&#39;re of course more at risk in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.140" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">hospital of getting other having other</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.410" end="00:53:55.900" style="s2">problems maybe there&#39;s a point at which</p>

<p begin="00:53:55.900" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">best move is to be at home rather than</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:02.470" style="s2">question and I think you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.150" end="00:54:06.550" style="s2">there is something to be investigated</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.470" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">there I&#39;m gonna just ask you to look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.550" end="00:54:10.300" style="s2">the chat sack and every couple of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:12.280" style="s2">minutes we&#39;re gonna check in and say can</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.300" end="00:54:20.470" style="s2">you hear us okay because I have no sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.280" end="00:54:23.020" style="s2">of all right great please tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.470" end="00:54:23.860" style="s2">the handsome Selectric - so I didn&#39;t no</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.020" end="00:54:27.220" style="s2">idea what you can see but I know</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.860" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">generally I block it somebody can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.220" end="00:54:30.760" style="s2">well enough and knows enough to know</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.920" style="s2">that that must be a Selectric - which</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.760" end="00:54:36.430" style="s2">indeed it is yeah it has a little story</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.920" end="00:54:39.220" style="s2">that goes along with it you and I both</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.430" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">as kids grew up in a house that happened</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.220" end="00:54:44.290" style="s2">to have two houses even it to separate</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:47.500" style="s2">houses because otherwise that&#39;d be gross</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.290" end="00:54:49.240" style="s2">but two separate houses that had a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.500" end="00:54:51.940" style="s2">Selectric typewriter and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.240" end="00:54:53.860" style="s2">thinking this was a very I was a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.940" end="00:54:56.890" style="s2">mechanically inclined kid and this was a</p>

<p begin="00:54:56.890" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">apart your childhood home Selectric oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.080" end="00:55:02.740" style="s2">boy</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:04.630" style="s2">my parents learned quickly that I had a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.740" end="00:55:06.820" style="s2">tendency to take things apart and as I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.630" end="00:55:08.750" style="s2">recall it I was more or less forbidden</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.820" end="00:55:12.230" style="s2">to touch this electric - because it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.750" end="00:55:13.430" style="s2">a very fancy typewriter and although I</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.230" end="00:55:15.320" style="s2">was good at putting things back together</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.430" end="00:55:16.760" style="s2">I was expected not to be able to do it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.320" end="00:55:18.620" style="s2">maybe it can i interject here and point</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.760" end="00:55:20.180" style="s2">out that you taught our younger son</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.620" end="00:55:23.660" style="s2">yesterday how to take apart a carburetor</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.180" end="00:55:26.480" style="s2">yes so so you&#39;re still at it and you</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.660" end="00:55:29.090" style="s2">rebuilt it yeah but actually this device</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.480" end="00:55:33.190" style="s2">here so we both grew up in homes that</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.090" end="00:55:36.290" style="s2">had a selector typewriter and I wanted I</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.190" end="00:55:38.690" style="s2">wanted my kids to have a Selectric</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.290" end="00:55:43.430" style="s2">typewriter that we could turn into a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.690" end="00:55:46.010" style="s2">printer by basically triggering the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.430" end="00:55:48.080" style="s2">switches in the keys basically I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.010" end="00:55:50.120" style="s2">to hack into the typewriter and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.080" end="00:55:53.360" style="s2">trigger the individual letters to type</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.120" end="00:55:55.490" style="s2">by triggering the switches associated</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.360" end="00:55:57.650" style="s2">with each key and we happen to cross</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.490" end="00:56:00.440" style="s2">this typewriter which looked to be in</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.650" end="00:56:02.930" style="s2">great shape I plugged it in at Goodwill</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.440" end="00:56:06.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t really work it came on but it did</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.930" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">not work and it was 11 bucks and I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.920" end="00:56:14.050" style="s2">thought 11 bucks all by it I bet you I</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:18.770" style="s2">can fix that bad boy and got it home and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.050" end="00:56:21.190" style="s2">opened it up and discovered a wow is</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.770" end="00:56:24.050" style="s2">that thing wild on the inside and be</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.190" end="00:56:25.430" style="s2">there ain&#39;t no switches in fact there</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.050" end="00:56:27.650" style="s2">are only two electric parts in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.430" end="00:56:30.050" style="s2">entire thing and they literally are the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.650" end="00:56:33.980" style="s2">motor and the switch everything else in</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.050" end="00:56:36.170" style="s2">there is mechanical and run the motor is</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.980" end="00:56:38.270" style="s2">basically sending power through a belt</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.170" end="00:56:40.070" style="s2">into this whole system and everything</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.270" end="00:56:42.020" style="s2">else that happens in there is mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.070" end="00:56:43.940" style="s2">so so you could technically power that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.020" end="00:56:45.440" style="s2">with a bicycle you could totally power</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.940" end="00:56:47.210" style="s2">that with a bicycle and I probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.440" end="00:56:50.030" style="s2">should just to spite those people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.210" end="00:56:52.760" style="s2">were dubious of my my plan with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.030" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">compressed air don&#39;t you also discover</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.760" end="00:56:58.010" style="s2">that they&#39;re like two or three Selectric</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.000" end="00:56:59.930" style="s2">repairmen left in the country oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.010" end="00:57:01.940" style="s2">more than that it&#39;s a small number and</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.930" end="00:57:04.190" style="s2">there&#39;d win I mean those things has got</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.940" end="00:57:05.840" style="s2">to be one of the most complex it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.190" end="00:57:07.070" style="s2">really a consumer object it was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.840" end="00:57:11.210" style="s2">business object but one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.070" end="00:57:12.650" style="s2">complex commodities ever devised the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.210" end="00:57:16.100" style="s2">thing is amazing and they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.650" end="00:57:18.980" style="s2">repairmen whose job was to travel around</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.100" end="00:57:22.220" style="s2">and service those things in place on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.980" end="00:57:23.990" style="s2">regular schedule but that was the what</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.220" end="00:57:25.940" style="s2">late 70s varieties point as most of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.990" end="00:57:28.310" style="s2">those people are now dead they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.940" end="00:57:30.740" style="s2">small number of them still out there</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.310" end="00:57:32.900" style="s2">some of some of them are referring these</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.740" end="00:57:35.000" style="s2">things you know and selling you could</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.900" end="00:57:36.860" style="s2">buy them for like I did 11 bucks and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.000" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">then you refer bit and you sell it for a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.860" end="00:57:41.120" style="s2">few hundred or something but anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:44.360" style="s2">a fantastically complicated object and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.120" end="00:57:46.880" style="s2">sort of at the point I realized how</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.360" end="00:57:49.430" style="s2">complex it was I started figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.880" end="00:57:52.670" style="s2">how to fix it and I&#39;m still learning</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.430" end="00:57:54.500" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult but anyway I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.670" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">got that one up and running it works the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.500" end="00:57:59.900" style="s2">correction works it can actually lift</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:03.170" style="s2">letters off the page so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.900" end="00:58:05.930" style="s2">the story excellent in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.170" end="00:58:07.910" style="s2">disappearance of dr. I fen by probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.930" end="00:58:09.770" style="s2">mispronouncing the name in light of the</p>

<p begin="00:58:16.160" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">I think whistleblowers deserve</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.690" end="00:58:23.720" style="s2">diplomatic immunity some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:26.270" style="s2">immunity it&#39;s hard to know in advance</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.720" end="00:58:28.730" style="s2">you know how do you how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.270" end="00:58:31.670" style="s2">you are worthy of immunity before you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.730" end="00:58:33.530" style="s2">get disappeared well I would say if and</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.670" end="00:58:35.270" style="s2">only if you want an honorable system</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.530" end="00:58:38.330" style="s2">figure out how to protect whistleblowers</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.270" end="00:58:39.710" style="s2">under SM and they a lot of people give</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.330" end="00:58:42.670" style="s2">lip service to the idea of protecting</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.710" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">whistleblowers but it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.670" end="00:58:47.510" style="s2">essential and I say that I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:50.980" style="s2">feel like a whistleblower when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.510" end="00:58:53.150" style="s2">to MOUs telomeres and you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.980" end="00:58:55.370" style="s2">forking it&#39;s the wrong metaphor it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.150" end="00:58:57.080" style="s2">tried to sound the alarm and the Bell</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.370" end="00:59:01.390" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t ring the whistle wouldn&#39;t blow</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.080" end="00:59:01.390" style="s2">whatever it was it just didn&#39;t work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.480" end="00:59:05.690" style="s2">hypoxia hypothesis current and former</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.040" end="00:59:08.390" style="s2">smokers are showing up underrepresented</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.690" end="00:59:12.350" style="s2">in the ICU data would this suggest</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.390" end="00:59:14.990" style="s2">evidence for the hypothesis now I feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.350" end="00:59:15.950" style="s2">like I saw something and I don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.990" end="00:59:17.800" style="s2">in front of me and this isn&#39;t my</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.950" end="00:59:20.150" style="s2">computer this is yours I can&#39;t look at I</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.800" end="00:59:22.970" style="s2">thought I saw the opposite I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.150" end="00:59:25.160" style="s2">saw that smoking was one of the risk</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.970" end="00:59:27.590" style="s2">factors one of the top six risk factors</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.160" end="00:59:29.990" style="s2">I just saw a list today where diabetes</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.590" end="00:59:30.920" style="s2">was the top risk factor kidney disease</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.990" end="00:59:33.770" style="s2">was in there</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.920" end="00:59:35.150" style="s2">COPD was in there I thought smoking was</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.770" end="00:59:37.250" style="s2">so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.150" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">we can still take this on but I would I</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.250" end="00:59:42.380" style="s2">would put a strong one caveat on I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:45.100" style="s2">sure that the claim is right I parked</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.380" end="00:59:47.450" style="s2">with regard to the hypoxia hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.100" end="00:59:49.220" style="s2">current and former smokers are showing</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.450" end="00:59:51.350" style="s2">up underrepresented in the ICU data</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.220" end="00:59:57.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the claim here would this suggest</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.350" end="00:59:59.150" style="s2">evidence for the hypoxia hypothesis it</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.740" end="00:59:59.930" style="s2">almost feels to me like it should go the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.150" end="01:00:02.750" style="s2">other way why would they be</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.930" end="01:00:04.880" style="s2">underrepresented in the ICU data is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.750" end="01:00:07.100" style="s2">suggesting that they are healthier</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.880" end="01:00:09.260" style="s2">because they&#39;ve already faced a low</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.100" end="01:00:11.240" style="s2">oxygen like they&#39;re effectively</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.260" end="01:00:13.100" style="s2">acclimated yeah I don&#39;t quite see the</p>

<p begin="01:02:04.259" end="01:02:11.249" style="s2">friends who were in there people were in</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.219" end="01:02:12.390" style="s2">their cars watching the sunset alone in</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.249" end="01:02:13.739" style="s2">their cars are in their cars with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.390" end="01:02:15.989" style="s2">people whom they were already quarantine</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.739" end="01:02:17.670" style="s2">and with watching the sunset and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.989" end="01:02:20.609" style="s2">can receive either a thousand dollar</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.670" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">fine or six up to six months in jail for</p>

<p begin="01:02:25.789" end="01:02:33.349" style="s2">incredible either just blatant abuse of</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.949" end="01:02:37.160" style="s2">power or more likely a confused</p>

<p begin="01:02:37.160" end="01:02:46.199" style="s2">directive so I would add I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.839" end="01:02:51.269" style="s2">you can make a society functional</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.199" end="01:02:53.789" style="s2">without discretion and so in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.269" end="01:02:57.299" style="s2">what we are seeing is a failure to</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.789" end="01:02:59.609" style="s2">either provide discretion or to utilize</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.299" end="01:03:01.380" style="s2">it properly what you need is people who</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.609" end="01:03:03.689" style="s2">understand what the objective of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.380" end="01:03:05.670" style="s2">policy is and know how to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.689" end="01:03:09.150" style="s2">exceptions that don&#39;t violate the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.670" end="01:03:10.739" style="s2">of the policy and so to the extent I I</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.150" end="01:03:13.019" style="s2">don&#39;t remember where I encountered it</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.739" end="01:03:14.309" style="s2">might even be a friend got evicted from</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.019" end="01:03:17.219" style="s2">a public park they were sitting on a</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.309" end="01:03:19.769" style="s2">bench alone you know fifty feet from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.219" end="01:03:22.529" style="s2">nearest person and they were apparently</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.769" end="01:03:27.179" style="s2">told that they were in violation of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.529" end="01:03:28.920" style="s2">law and the fact is you know we use the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.179" end="01:03:31.619" style="s2">analogy sometimes that we are physically</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.920" end="01:03:33.689" style="s2">a robot but that robot has a computer</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.619" end="01:03:39.179" style="s2">riding on its shoulder and that computer</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.689" end="01:03:41.789" style="s2">is it has needs and so if we simply</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.179" end="01:03:43.559" style="s2">start figuring out what the robot needs</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.789" end="01:03:45.089" style="s2">to do in order not to catch this virus</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.559" end="01:03:46.650" style="s2">and we stop paying attention to the fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.089" end="01:03:49.319" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to drive people stark</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.650" end="01:03:51.779" style="s2">raving mad if you lock them down and</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.319" end="01:03:53.279" style="s2">don&#39;t let them access those things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.779" end="01:03:55.640" style="s2">would make them feel some degree of</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.279" end="01:03:58.979" style="s2">normalcy and have almost no risk of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.640" end="01:04:00.689" style="s2">catching or transmitting the disease and</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.979" end="01:04:01.019" style="s2">give them no sense of legitimate hope or</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.689" end="01:04:04.319" style="s2">this thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.019" end="01:04:06.479" style="s2">ever ending yeah then you know you we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.319" end="01:04:08.969" style="s2">gonna create a catastrophe and also next</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.479" end="01:04:10.769" style="s2">time this happens we in the northern</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.969" end="01:04:14.089" style="s2">hemisphere might be heading into winter</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.769" end="01:04:17.549" style="s2">not summer right we are in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.089" end="01:04:19.649" style="s2">lucky that even if the virus doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.549" end="01:04:21.869" style="s2">respond to warmer weather the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.649" end="01:04:24.419" style="s2">people you know many of them might have</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.869" end="01:04:26.519" style="s2">a courtyard they can go sit in or a tree</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.419" end="01:04:28.949" style="s2">they can sit under that&#39;s very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.519" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">but we need to figure out how to do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.949" end="01:04:35.939" style="s2">humanely and that means you know the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:38.369" style="s2">question is apt when is it too much no</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.939" end="01:04:42.359" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s quite apt it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.369" end="01:04:45.959" style="s2">it is too much and but but part of how</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.359" end="01:04:48.989" style="s2">it&#39;s too much is the rote and robot like</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.959" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">receiving and dispensing of orders so</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.989" end="01:04:52.739" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of you know we&#39;re not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.779" style="s2">not going through these as quickly as I</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.739" end="01:04:56.399" style="s2">was hoping we would before but um I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.779" end="01:04:59.459" style="s2">wonder if you would talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.399" end="01:05:00.839" style="s2">about this at first it&#39;s gonna sound</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.459" end="01:05:05.359" style="s2">like it&#39;s coming at it out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.839" end="01:05:08.699" style="s2">but your experience during occupy when</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.359" end="01:05:13.229" style="s2">you insisted on engaging with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.699" end="01:05:17.309" style="s2">policemen who showed up to disband the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.229" end="01:05:21.299" style="s2">Occupy artisan call it yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.309" end="01:05:23.699" style="s2">participants who were who were at the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.299" end="01:05:25.829" style="s2">capital campus in Olympia Washington</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.699" end="01:05:28.709" style="s2">and you know there were a number of our</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.829" end="01:05:30.809" style="s2">students who were up there with us and</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.709" end="01:05:33.029" style="s2">then I think on a couple of occasions</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.809" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">the police showed up and so I I left</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.029" end="01:05:36.509" style="s2">with our children because it was</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:38.069" style="s2">important that if people were going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.509" end="01:05:40.499" style="s2">be arrested no one you know it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.069" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">happen to both but you talked to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.499" end="01:05:42.509" style="s2">police</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:44.789" style="s2">yeah I thought it was very important</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.509" end="01:05:48.149" style="s2">that the police understand that they</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.789" end="01:05:50.189" style="s2">were facing human beings and you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.149" end="01:05:51.719" style="s2">there were some there were some bad cops</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.189" end="01:05:53.399" style="s2">I remember them there were some people</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.719" end="01:05:57.199" style="s2">who were clearly interested in</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.399" end="01:05:59.939" style="s2">exercising power and but there were also</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.199" end="01:06:02.579" style="s2">compassionate people and most of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.939" end="01:06:06.539" style="s2">you interacted with yes and the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.579" end="01:06:08.639" style="s2">the many of the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.539" end="01:06:12.509" style="s2">associated with Occupy had a strong</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.639" end="01:06:14.220" style="s2">anarchist bent I&#39;m quite anti anarchist</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.509" end="01:06:16.650" style="s2">but the anarchists have this</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.220" end="01:06:19.619" style="s2">that all cops are bastards and all of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.650" end="01:06:21.750" style="s2">this stuff and what that resulted in was</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.619" end="01:06:23.430" style="s2">not engaging the cops as if they were</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.750" end="01:06:26.280" style="s2">him and treating them as if they are not</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.430" end="01:06:28.530" style="s2">human which resulted in the cops feeling</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.280" end="01:06:30.030" style="s2">like they were dealing with nonhumans on</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.530" end="01:06:31.290" style="s2">the other side and it was a you know it</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.030" end="01:06:33.090" style="s2">was just a catastrophe waiting to happen</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.290" end="01:06:35.700" style="s2">so I thought you were being a patsy for</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.090" end="01:06:37.890" style="s2">wanting to engage right so the idea you</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.700" end="01:06:39.480" style="s2">know some some of the the anti-occupy</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.890" end="01:06:41.640" style="s2">people would say you&#39;re being ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.480" end="01:06:43.320" style="s2">for engaging with the Occupy people at</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.640" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">all and the people with an Occupy were</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.320" end="01:06:46.980" style="s2">saying how not only how foolish of you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:50.280" style="s2">but how dare you interact with the cops</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.980" end="01:06:52.260" style="s2">and you know you had good human</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.280" end="01:06:54.869" style="s2">interactions with the policeman who had</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.260" end="01:06:57.359" style="s2">been who had been sent to disband a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.869" end="01:06:59.160" style="s2">group and with whom you had human</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:02.310" style="s2">interactions yep and I&#39;m waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.160" end="01:07:06.690" style="s2">those stories here yeah now and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.310" end="01:07:08.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t see them yet there is so much</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.690" end="01:07:10.050" style="s2">contradictory information being given to</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.340" end="01:07:11.670" style="s2">us wear a mask masks won&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.050" end="01:07:13.710" style="s2">difference stay home go out and get Sun</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.670" end="01:07:18.320" style="s2">et cetera how do we sift through it will</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.710" end="01:07:21.780" style="s2">prevent the spread of Sina of cover 19</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.320" end="01:07:24.780" style="s2">well part of why we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.780" end="01:07:28.170" style="s2">doing is so that you will hear how</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.780" end="01:07:31.050" style="s2">people who have a background in biology</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.170" end="01:07:35.730" style="s2">and have a lot of experience you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.050" end="01:07:39.359" style="s2">teaching students are parsing these</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.730" end="01:07:43.800" style="s2">questions themselves and you know that</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.359" end="01:07:46.440" style="s2">if you optimize for zero likelihood of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.800" end="01:07:49.740" style="s2">spread you will end up in a completely</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.440" end="01:07:51.089" style="s2">paralyzed universe right in fact you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.740" end="01:07:53.250" style="s2">starve because you won&#39;t be able to go</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.089" end="01:07:54.690" style="s2">out and get food and at some point your</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.250" end="01:07:56.040" style="s2">supplies will dwindle and you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.690" end="01:07:57.750" style="s2">psychologically destroyed you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.040" end="01:08:01.830" style="s2">psychologically destroyed along the way</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.750" end="01:08:03.150" style="s2">so in essence what I really I hesitate</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.830" end="01:08:04.530" style="s2">to say this because I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.150" end="01:08:07.290" style="s2">somebody to get sick because somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.530" end="01:08:09.990" style="s2">else makes a bad call but in essence</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.290" end="01:08:12.300" style="s2">what you need is to understand as much</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.990" end="01:08:14.940" style="s2">as possible about how the virus</p>

<p begin="01:09:48.540" end="01:09:52.770" style="s2">taken a lot of flack from some fairly</p>

<p begin="01:09:58.290" end="01:10:02.699" style="s2">particulars are but my basic point is I</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.600" end="01:10:05.400" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that random mutation on</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.699" end="01:10:08.520" style="s2">its own results in the kind of diversity</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.400" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">that we have I believe random mutation</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.520" end="01:10:13.260" style="s2">and selection built an earlier world in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:15.960" style="s2">which selection then figured out how to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.260" end="01:10:17.940" style="s2">explore more efficiently and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.960" end="01:10:20.130" style="s2">exploring more efficiently is still a</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.130" end="01:10:24.750" style="s2">haphazard and so when we see something</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.590" end="01:10:27.030" style="s2">like the Cambrian explosion we may not</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.750" end="01:10:30.780" style="s2">know what innovation it was that set</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.030" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">loose this tremendous diversity but the</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.780" end="01:10:34.890" style="s2">question is look random mutation might</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">not get you there but the random</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.890" end="01:10:39.620" style="s2">mutation building a mechanism you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:42.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.620" end="01:10:44.600" style="s2">we got three things all working together</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.620" end="01:10:46.370" style="s2">and sort of leapfrogging over one</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.600" end="01:10:47.960" style="s2">another but not necessarily in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.370" end="01:10:49.160" style="s2">particular order I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.960" end="01:10:50.810" style="s2">of course more the magnificence of</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.160" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">microevolution include other things but</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.810" end="01:10:54.350" style="s2">the three things you just mentioned a</p>

<p begin="01:11:03.880" end="01:11:08.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve overly fallen in love with the</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:09.860" style="s2">random part of the story when it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.570" end="01:11:12.230" style="s2">never the important part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.860" end="01:11:15.980" style="s2">but you know I would say the question is</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.230" end="01:11:18.860" style="s2">a little bit analogous to a you know a</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.980" end="01:11:21.710" style="s2">colony of cells how does it navigate</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.860" end="01:11:24.500" style="s2">around the room right are you telling me</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.710" end="01:11:26.180" style="s2">that colony of cells you know well I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.500" end="01:11:27.680" style="s2">colony of cells how did I know where the</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.180" end="01:11:29.830" style="s2">glass of water was well it happens that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.680" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">some of those cells are organized into a</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.830" end="01:11:33.860" style="s2">pattern that allows me to detect the</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:34.940" style="s2">precise location of the glass and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.860" end="01:11:36.680" style="s2">know is it amazing</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.940" end="01:11:39.110" style="s2">you better believe it&#39;s amazing but is</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.680" end="01:11:42.350" style="s2">it inexplicable foul it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.110" end="01:11:43.880" style="s2">explicable so so anyway it&#39;s that kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.350" end="01:11:46.010" style="s2">of thing yes selection has figured out a</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.930" end="01:15:05.120" style="s2">the opposite is true what is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.040" end="01:15:06.480" style="s2">I believe clear that language has</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.860" end="01:15:57.690" style="s2">is not right there is no no forests</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.650" end="01:16:01.590" style="s2">don&#39;t evolve in the same way that</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.690" end="01:16:05.180" style="s2">individual trees and tree species do yep</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.590" end="01:16:07.980" style="s2">yes yeah amazing things are possible</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.180" end="01:16:17.160" style="s2">participate in one but there is a</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.160" end="01:16:21.180" style="s2">I would say emergent phenomena are real</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.989" end="01:16:22.050" style="s2">it is not right to say that forests</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.180" end="01:16:23.370" style="s2">don&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.050" end="01:16:25.470" style="s2">but it is right to say that they do not</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.370" end="01:16:28.890" style="s2">evolve right they do not have the</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.470" end="01:16:32.940" style="s2">prerequisites to evolve so really what</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.890" end="01:16:37.350" style="s2">you have is a virus taking advantage of</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.940" end="01:16:41.700" style="s2">the kind of closeness that occurs at</p>

<p begin="01:16:41.700" end="01:16:46.260" style="s2">is a integral participant in some</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.610" end="01:16:48.110" style="s2">agreement to thin the population or</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.989" end="01:16:59.060" style="s2">harm yeah at the moment but that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.170" end="01:17:01.910" style="s2">not it being sent to do the most harm</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.060" end="01:17:04.140" style="s2">how does sickle cell and gene variants</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.910" end="01:17:05.670" style="s2">possibly relate to the reasons why this</p>

<p begin="01:17:05.670" end="01:17:11.700" style="s2">communities the most well it would seem</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.720" end="01:17:14.040" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s relatively simple to</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.700" end="01:17:15.960" style="s2">test whether or not the disproportionate</p>

<p begin="01:17:15.960" end="01:17:20.310" style="s2">is sickle cell related in other words if</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.300" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">we control for those people who</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.310" end="01:17:23.940" style="s2">carry the sickle-cell trait into</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:25.530" style="s2">adulthood do we still see</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.940" end="01:17:28.410" style="s2">disproportionate effects my guess is you</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.530" end="01:17:30.720" style="s2">would it&#39;s not clear to me from this</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.410" end="01:17:32.340" style="s2">question if he is referring to our</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.720" end="01:17:35.550" style="s2">conversation last time or if this is</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.340" end="01:17:38.100" style="s2">coming to novo yeah but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.550" end="01:17:41.100" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly possible and would be</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.100" end="01:17:46.260" style="s2">relatively easy yeah to test but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.100" end="01:17:48.990" style="s2">just say it is possible that sickle cell</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.260" end="01:17:51.780" style="s2">which reduces the capacity of the blood</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.990" end="01:17:53.550" style="s2">to carry oxygen puts people who carry</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.780" end="01:17:54.900" style="s2">the trait as a heterozygote that is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.550" end="01:17:56.580" style="s2">say they have one copy of the sickle</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.900" end="01:17:58.650" style="s2">cell gene and one copy of the normal</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.580" end="01:18:00.990" style="s2">gene it would put them at</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.650" end="01:18:06.030" style="s2">disproportionate risk which might result</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.990" end="01:18:10.010" style="s2">in more extreme cases it is also</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.030" end="01:18:13.260" style="s2">possible that economic factors or</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.010" end="01:18:14.460" style="s2">demographic factors are the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.260" end="01:18:16.550" style="s2">the connection and it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.460" end="01:18:18.930" style="s2">with sickle cell this does raise another</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.550" end="01:18:21.720" style="s2">correction of sorts in talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.930" end="01:18:23.300" style="s2">sickle cell anemia last time I had</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.720" end="01:18:25.380" style="s2">suggested that if you&#39;re heterozygous</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.300" end="01:18:26.790" style="s2">you seem to do fine but you probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.380" end="01:18:28.770" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to be an elite athlete and</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.790" end="01:18:31.170" style="s2">a few people pointed out is that David</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.770" end="01:18:33.090" style="s2">Goggins I think who is maybe a former</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.170" end="01:18:34.530" style="s2">Marine and an elite athlete and is also</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.090" end="01:18:35.850" style="s2">heterozygous for sickle cells really</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.530" end="01:18:37.620" style="s2">there will be you know there will be</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.850" end="01:18:39.420" style="s2">exceptions but that&#39;s extraordinary that</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.620" end="01:18:41.310" style="s2">is extraordinary yeah I hope I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.420" end="01:18:45.660" style="s2">the name right I wasn&#39;t aware of him</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.310" end="01:18:47.310" style="s2">before this let&#39;s entertain let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.660" end="01:18:50.040" style="s2">entertain the conspiracy of covered</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.310" end="01:18:52.080" style="s2">being caused by 5g if in fact your</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.040" end="01:18:53.610" style="s2">theory is correct could 5g possibly</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.080" end="01:18:56.690" style="s2">interfere with hemoglobin because the</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.610" end="01:18:59.010" style="s2">iron is some kind of cellular antenna</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.690" end="01:19:01.920" style="s2">take this one yeah you&#39;re gonna let me</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.010" end="01:19:05.280" style="s2">take that one well thank you I would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.920" end="01:19:06.990" style="s2">I am NOT a fan of the idea of 5g for so</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.280" end="01:19:11.700" style="s2">many different reasons I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.990" end="01:19:14.460" style="s2">need it and I don&#39;t think doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.700" end="01:19:16.590" style="s2">high-energy stuff in such a close</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.460" end="01:19:18.960" style="s2">proximity to people is a good idea I</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.590" end="01:19:20.940" style="s2">have no idea I&#39;ve I&#39;ve heard these</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.960" end="01:19:22.440" style="s2">connections to I haven&#39;t yet seen</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.940" end="01:19:24.660" style="s2">anything that compels me it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.440" end="01:19:26.100" style="s2">going down that road I&#39;m open to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.660" end="01:19:31.580" style="s2">possibility that there&#39;s some evidence</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.100" end="01:19:33.690" style="s2">that I need to see but anyway yes it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.580" end="01:19:36.739" style="s2">unprecedented in</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.690" end="01:19:38.640" style="s2">many ways or it&#39;s not 5g 5g is</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.739" end="01:19:40.620" style="s2">unprecedented and so could it have</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.640" end="01:19:42.630" style="s2">effects that we have yet to discover of</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.620" end="01:19:45.600" style="s2">course yeah and you know we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.630" end="01:19:47.250" style="s2">unprecedented things coming together at</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.600" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">more or less the same time so of course</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.250" end="01:19:53.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve been put together causally but I</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:55.350" style="s2">want to see the I want to see the</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.400" end="01:19:58.610" style="s2">evidence that makes it worth my time to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.350" end="01:20:01.050" style="s2">chase this particular connection yep</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.610" end="01:20:02.489" style="s2">many species go extinct due to</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.050" end="01:20:05.370" style="s2">rainforest destruction for animal</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.489" end="01:20:07.410" style="s2">agriculture isn&#39;t it smarter to let pigs</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.370" end="01:20:13.380" style="s2">cows and chicken go extinct to save more</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.410" end="01:20:17.520" style="s2">species you let me do that sure okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.380" end="01:20:20.130" style="s2">first of all farming where tropical</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.520" end="01:20:22.920" style="s2">rainforest once stood is never a good</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.130" end="01:20:25.080" style="s2">idea it doesn&#39;t work very effectively</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.920" end="01:20:26.820" style="s2">because the very nature of tropical</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.080" end="01:20:28.890" style="s2">rainforest is that they sit on top of</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.820" end="01:20:31.890" style="s2">soils which some will claim are</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.890" end="01:20:34.380" style="s2">paradoxically depleted I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.890" end="01:20:35.370" style="s2">it&#39;s paradoxical at all this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.380" end="01:20:40.050" style="s2">the things I addressed in my</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.370" end="01:20:43.350" style="s2">dissertation but the fact is there are</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.050" end="01:20:47.430" style="s2">places that you can raise animals and do</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.350" end="01:20:50.640" style="s2">it properly I am no fan of factory</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.430" end="01:20:53.670" style="s2">farming I think it&#39;s despicable and it</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.640" end="01:20:55.680" style="s2">cannot be morally justified but that</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.670" end="01:20:59.130" style="s2">does not require us the not growing</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.680" end="01:21:02.300" style="s2">animals on fragile thin tropical soils</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.130" end="01:21:05.640" style="s2">and not growing animals in an inhumane</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.300" end="01:21:08.310" style="s2">way on a feedlot or at a high density in</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.640" end="01:21:09.870" style="s2">a cage or whatever that does not force</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.310" end="01:21:12.420" style="s2">us to go all the way to driving them</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.870" end="01:21:14.640" style="s2">extinct we could eat a lot less meat and</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.420" end="01:21:16.050" style="s2">not eat zero that would address many of</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.640" end="01:21:17.940" style="s2">the health problems that arise when</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.050" end="01:21:19.530" style="s2">people go to zero with respect to meat</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.940" end="01:21:22.199" style="s2">and it can be done in a way that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.530" end="01:21:24.449" style="s2">involve a moral compromise so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.199" end="01:21:26.160" style="s2">don&#39;t want to see rainforests cleared to</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.449" end="01:21:27.270" style="s2">to raise these animals but it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.160" end="01:21:29.400" style="s2">been a good idea in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.270" end="01:21:32.790" style="s2">let&#39;s just put a tiny bit more nuance on</p>

<p begin="01:28:36.770" end="01:28:42.290" style="s2">the breadth of his connections yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.750" end="01:28:44.210" style="s2">the nature of them yes please can you</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.290" end="01:28:45.739" style="s2">discuss invasive species is this a real</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.210" end="01:28:47.420" style="s2">thing is there debate here aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.739" end="01:28:48.949" style="s2">conservationists simply picking a point</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.420" end="01:28:50.480" style="s2">in time and saying we like this best</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.949" end="01:28:53.630" style="s2">let&#39;s keep it this way Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.480" end="01:28:57.320" style="s2">oh my god it&#39;s so much here so this this</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.630" end="01:28:59.090" style="s2">is many many hours of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.320" end="01:29:00.440" style="s2">let me try first just I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.090" end="01:29:02.090" style="s2">backwards through the questions aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.440" end="01:29:03.590" style="s2">conservationists simply picking a point</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.090" end="01:29:05.210" style="s2">in time and saying we like this best</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.590" end="01:29:07.340" style="s2">let&#39;s keep it this way there is some of</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.210" end="01:29:11.270" style="s2">that for sure right there is sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.340" end="01:29:13.340" style="s2">moment of this is when we the ecologist</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.270" end="01:29:14.989" style="s2">started paying attention and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.340" end="01:29:18.230" style="s2">declared that the moment in time that</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.989" end="01:29:21.110" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to preserve and it it</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.230" end="01:29:22.640" style="s2">forgets that environments change and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.110" end="01:29:27.440" style="s2">devolution happens and it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.640" end="01:29:32.960" style="s2">naive view of nature that said invasive</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:34.760" style="s2">species are real and when it is humans</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.960" end="01:29:36.290" style="s2">with our modern technology who are</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.760" end="01:29:39.290" style="s2">moving things around the world either</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.290" end="01:29:40.940" style="s2">intentionally or not and bringing them</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.290" end="01:29:42.500" style="s2">into environments where they have no</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.940" end="01:29:44.750" style="s2">native competitors or pathogens or</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.500" end="01:29:46.760" style="s2">predators allowing them to take off and</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.750" end="01:29:48.590" style="s2">become monocultures to the benefit of</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.760" end="01:29:50.270" style="s2">nothing but those species there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.590" end="01:29:53.690" style="s2">problem and you&#39;ve you&#39;ve rendered</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.270" end="01:29:55.010" style="s2">ecosystems unhealthy yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.690" end="01:29:58.310" style="s2">another thing I covered in in my</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.010" end="01:30:00.140" style="s2">dissertation we have a problem that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.310" end="01:30:02.719" style="s2">very serious with what are called</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.140" end="01:30:05.540" style="s2">invasive species one has to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.719" end="01:30:07.090" style="s2">not to declare anything that shows up in</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.540" end="01:30:09.050" style="s2">someplace where it didn&#39;t exist before</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.090" end="01:30:10.820" style="s2">invasive because that&#39;s not what they</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.050" end="01:30:13.250" style="s2">are there are ornamentals there are</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.820" end="01:30:14.929" style="s2">non-native species but invasive well and</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.250" end="01:30:17.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all predictive paradigm as to</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.929" end="01:30:19.250" style="s2">which which ornamentals for instance are</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.120" end="01:30:22.310" style="s2">likely to escape from their ornamental</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.250" end="01:30:24.560" style="s2">status and become invasive versus</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.310" end="01:30:27.710" style="s2">stay in a garden and be just fine yeah</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.560" end="01:30:32.260" style="s2">and I would also say that in traveling</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.710" end="01:30:34.820" style="s2">the world the the devastation of</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.260" end="01:30:36.429" style="s2">habitats that comes from invasive</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.820" end="01:30:40.389" style="s2">species is</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.429" end="01:30:43.949" style="s2">absolutely jaw-dropping my least</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.389" end="01:30:47.949" style="s2">favorite creatures on earth are probably</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.949" end="01:30:51.579" style="s2">trees in the eucalyptus family because</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.949" end="01:30:55.420" style="s2">they have absolutely devastated habitats</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.579" end="01:30:58.709" style="s2">in California in fact along the whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.420" end="01:31:01.539" style="s2">west coast of the US the Andes are</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.709" end="01:31:03.880" style="s2">utterly transformed by them where</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.539" end="01:31:08.889" style="s2">eucalyptus is everywhere and the native</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.880" end="01:31:10.329" style="s2">trees that were there are found mostly</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.889" end="01:31:12.519" style="s2">in in places where they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.329" end="01:31:14.199" style="s2">cultivated it&#39;s so destructive so just</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.519" end="01:31:16.300" style="s2">to be clear eucalyptus is native to</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.199" end="01:31:18.010" style="s2">Australia it doesn&#39;t it does it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.300" end="01:31:19.329" style="s2">start out in the new world at all it was</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.010" end="01:31:23.679" style="s2">humans who brought it to the new world</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.329" end="01:31:26.229" style="s2">and it spread so fast it spreads so it</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.679" end="01:31:27.729" style="s2">is simply a superior competitor and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.229" end="01:31:29.289" style="s2">I think the answer you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.729" end="01:31:32.889" style="s2">whether you want to hear it or not is</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.289" end="01:31:36.090" style="s2">that the problem is there&#39;s a trade-off</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.889" end="01:31:38.889" style="s2">between competitive ability and</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.090" end="01:31:40.659" style="s2">dispersal ability and so the limits of</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.889" end="01:31:42.880" style="s2">where things are found are very often</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.659" end="01:31:44.739" style="s2">structured by that very ferocious</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.880" end="01:31:47.559" style="s2">competitors are often limited in where</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.739" end="01:31:49.179" style="s2">they can get and so when we transport</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.559" end="01:31:51.400" style="s2">something like eucalyptus what we were</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.179" end="01:31:53.769" style="s2">effectively doing is saying let every</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.400" end="01:31:56.260" style="s2">habitat be dominated by the same</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.769" end="01:31:58.030" style="s2">critters and what that means is an</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.260" end="01:31:59.650" style="s2">overall loss in the diversity of</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.030" end="01:32:02.139" style="s2">critters around and I don&#39;t know live in</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.650" end="01:32:03.610" style="s2">a less diverse world for lots of reasons</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.139" end="01:32:06.130" style="s2">having everything to do with human</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.610" end="01:32:08.590" style="s2">utility and well-being I want to live in</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.130" end="01:32:11.769" style="s2">a highly diverse world and so if I want</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.590" end="01:32:13.809" style="s2">to live in a highly diverse world the</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.769" end="01:32:16.030" style="s2">invasive species are among the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.809" end="01:32:17.590" style="s2">threats because once Unleashed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.030" end="01:32:19.780" style="s2">almost impossible to do anything about</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.590" end="01:32:22.570" style="s2">them if they&#39;re really good competitors</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.780" end="01:32:25.449" style="s2">like eucalyptus then you know a single</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.570" end="01:32:31.420" style="s2">error where they get released is out of</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.449" end="01:32:35.530" style="s2">control almost instantly how does how</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.420" end="01:32:36.969" style="s2">does fungi reprogram ant brains it&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.530" end="01:32:39.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.969" end="01:32:42.729" style="s2">know how it does it I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.880" end="01:32:44.860" style="s2">anybody does yeah but what I can say is</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.729" end="01:32:49.119" style="s2">that the real question is how do ant</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.860" end="01:32:49.930" style="s2">brains work and the itself is I mean so</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.119" end="01:32:52.330" style="s2">they they have</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.930" end="01:32:54.160" style="s2">don&#39;t they a bunch of ganglia so they</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.330" end="01:32:57.190" style="s2">don&#39;t have a centralized brain they have</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.160" end="01:32:58.390" style="s2">I think I thinkwell have at the very</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.190" end="01:33:00.820" style="s2">least they don&#39;t have something that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.390" end="01:33:02.980" style="s2">would all agree as a brain but they do</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.820" end="01:33:06.880" style="s2">have neurological processing that</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.980" end="01:33:08.440" style="s2">results in coordinated behavior and in</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.880" end="01:33:11.380" style="s2">order to understand how a fungus</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.440" end="01:33:15.520" style="s2">intervenes to get a creature to behave</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.380" end="01:33:17.260" style="s2">in this way you probably have to realize</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.520" end="01:33:19.890" style="s2">what heuristics are running about inside</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.260" end="01:33:22.690" style="s2">an ants head which I don&#39;t think we know</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.890" end="01:33:25.750" style="s2">but lots of you know to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.690" end="01:33:28.090" style="s2">rabies causes you know anger and an</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.750" end="01:33:29.830" style="s2">infected dog that causes the dog to</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.090" end="01:33:34.000" style="s2">behave in a way that spreads the rabies</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.830" end="01:33:35.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the same kind of process but maybe</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.000" end="01:33:37.570" style="s2">it&#39;s easier to understand in a dog how</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.800" end="01:33:39.610" style="s2">you would trigger anger because lots of</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.570" end="01:33:41.110" style="s2">things confusion because we know that</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.610" end="01:33:42.820" style="s2">mammals experience these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.110" end="01:33:45.100" style="s2">emotions because we&#39;re mammals yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.820" end="01:33:46.870" style="s2">it&#39;s harder it&#39;s harder to understand</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.100" end="01:33:49.000" style="s2">what seems like a complex behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.870" end="01:33:51.280" style="s2">response in an organism that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.000" end="01:33:58.990" style="s2">think of as having individually complex</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.280" end="01:34:01.630" style="s2">behavior yep all right please can you</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.990" end="01:34:06.310" style="s2">discuss alright switch it out please can</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.630" end="01:34:08.680" style="s2">you same question no okay</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.310" end="01:34:09.310" style="s2">the invasive species question again I</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.680" end="01:34:11.560" style="s2">think we did it</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.310" end="01:34:13.150" style="s2">did you see the videos regarding Philly</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.560" end="01:34:14.980" style="s2">Metro personnel and security</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.150" end="01:34:18.060" style="s2">aggressively kicking people off for</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.980" end="01:34:19.900" style="s2">failure to wear masks this is from Jonas</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.060" end="01:34:24.370" style="s2">apologize if I&#39;m mispronouncing your</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.900" end="01:34:27.810" style="s2">name someone we know on Twitter didn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.370" end="01:34:27.810" style="s2">don&#39;t see these videos I didn&#39;t either</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.680" end="01:34:33.820" style="s2">yeah well I don&#39;t know what to say I</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.470" end="01:34:36.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t see the video so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.820" end="01:34:41.590" style="s2">whether it would be obviously beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.520" end="01:34:43.270" style="s2">pale or you know justified but I can say</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.590" end="01:34:46.270" style="s2">I have watched a radical transformation</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.270" end="01:34:49.390" style="s2">in how what percentage of people are</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.270" end="01:34:51.280" style="s2">wearing some kind of mask and I regard</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.390" end="01:34:53.350" style="s2">that as on the one hand very good news</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.280" end="01:34:55.960" style="s2">people are taking this seriously and on</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.350" end="01:34:59.200" style="s2">the other hand how many people are going</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.960" end="01:35:02.440" style="s2">to die because other people were afraid</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.200" end="01:35:03.670" style="s2">to stand out right in other words if you</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.440" end="01:35:04.960" style="s2">weren&#39;t wearing a mask because</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.670" end="01:35:06.660" style="s2">other people weren&#39;t wearing masks and</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.960" end="01:35:09.340" style="s2">you&#39;d feel dumb wearing a mask or</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.660" end="01:35:11.140" style="s2">somebody hadn&#39;t given you the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.340" end="01:35:14.590" style="s2">license you would need to innovate some</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.140" end="01:35:17.650" style="s2">kind of a mask then other people were</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.590" end="01:35:21.040" style="s2">put at risk and so what I hope is that</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.650" end="01:35:22.989" style="s2">next time we will remember that we all</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.040" end="01:35:25.510" style="s2">ended up wearing the masks and we will</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.989" end="01:35:30.040" style="s2">be able to jump to it and you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.510" end="01:35:32.679" style="s2">of lives could be saved yeah the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.040" end="01:35:34.449" style="s2">expert the biggest expert in a research</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.679" end="01:35:36.250" style="s2">area usually has the most motivation to</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.449" end="01:35:38.920" style="s2">dishonestly kill work that is disruptive</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.250" end="01:35:40.690" style="s2">true how is it that this obvious</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.920" end="01:35:46.030" style="s2">conflict of interest is overlooked when</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.690" end="01:35:50.199" style="s2">a paper is assigned reviewers yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.030" end="01:35:52.780" style="s2">let&#39;s just be clear assigned reviewers</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.199" end="01:35:56.380" style="s2">is already the problem the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.780" end="01:35:58.780" style="s2">field has the right to kill off concepts</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.380" end="01:36:01.210" style="s2">because they&#39;re not high quality doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.780" end="01:36:03.370" style="s2">make any sense it made sense maybe in a</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.210" end="01:36:04.989" style="s2">world where ink and paper were limited</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.370" end="01:36:06.820" style="s2">and you had to figure out on what to</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.989" end="01:36:10.179" style="s2">spend them but we are now talking about</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.820" end="01:36:12.400" style="s2">pixels pixels are not expensive if you</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.179" end="01:36:14.920" style="s2">want to put out an idea that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.400" end="01:36:16.480" style="s2">thinks is stupid well let&#39;s let you put</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.920" end="01:36:18.400" style="s2">it out and if you turn out to be right a</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.480" end="01:36:19.840" style="s2">hundred years from now we can come back</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.400" end="01:36:22.840" style="s2">to it and we can say well we got that</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.840" end="01:36:25.449" style="s2">wrong so what where&#39;s the harm in it so</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.840" end="01:36:28.030" style="s2">let&#39;s just do the process of reviewing</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.449" end="01:36:29.350" style="s2">other people&#39;s work in public where the</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.030" end="01:36:30.880" style="s2">people who turn out to be right</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.350" end="01:36:32.469" style="s2">especially people who turn out to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.880" end="01:36:34.750" style="s2">right and way ahead of their time are</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.469" end="01:36:36.219" style="s2">ultimately vindicated and the people who</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.750" end="01:36:37.830" style="s2">we thought were experts who turn out to</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.219" end="01:36:40.810" style="s2">be wrong again and again and again</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.830" end="01:36:43.330" style="s2">stopped being listened to so there are</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.810" end="01:36:44.530" style="s2">going to be one piece of pushback there</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.330" end="01:36:46.989" style="s2">is going to be you know everyone</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.530" end="01:36:49.330" style="s2">complains about review or two three</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.989" end="01:36:51.310" style="s2">three papers the three reviewers and</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.330" end="01:36:53.739" style="s2">it&#39;s always reviewer two comes up with</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.310" end="01:36:56.560" style="s2">the most ridiculous arguments against</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.739" end="01:36:59.260" style="s2">the paper but in general what those</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.560" end="01:37:00.810" style="s2">three reviewers peer reviewers on any</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.260" end="01:37:02.770" style="s2">paper are supposed to be doing is</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.810" end="01:37:05.560" style="s2">looking at different aspects of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.770" end="01:37:10.179" style="s2">paper so for it so if this is all to</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.560" end="01:37:12.820" style="s2">happen in public very few people have</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.179" end="01:37:15.160" style="s2">equal facility and say assessing whether</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.820" end="01:37:16.060" style="s2">or not the theoretical framework for a</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.160" end="01:37:16.389" style="s2">paper makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.060" end="01:37:18.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.389" end="01:37:20.649" style="s2">is actually building on the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.159" end="01:37:23.019" style="s2">the authors are claiming and whether or</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.649" end="01:37:25.269" style="s2">not the experimental design and the</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.019" end="01:37:28.239" style="s2">prediction and the hypothesis that is</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.269" end="01:37:29.409" style="s2">being tested is actually being tested</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.239" end="01:37:30.729" style="s2">with this experimental design whether or</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.409" end="01:37:32.530" style="s2">not the predictions inherently follow</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.729" end="01:37:36.419" style="s2">from the hypothesis so it&#39;s a second</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.530" end="01:37:39.039" style="s2">realm data analysis is a hugely</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.419" end="01:37:40.090" style="s2">technical realm and most of the people</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.039" end="01:37:41.829" style="s2">who can do that really relish</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.090" end="01:37:43.269" style="s2">statisticians who don&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.829" end="01:37:44.800" style="s2">the chops to do the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.269" end="01:37:52.269" style="s2">assessment and experiment design</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.800" end="01:37:55.989" style="s2">assessment and I would say you don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.269" end="01:37:58.630" style="s2">is useful to feel to know that someone</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.989" end="01:38:01.329" style="s2">with the chops that you don&#39;t have has</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.630" end="01:38:03.719" style="s2">looked at a paper and said yep that</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.329" end="01:38:06.969" style="s2">passes muster over in my end of things</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.719" end="01:38:08.919" style="s2">especially now with the ridiculously</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.969" end="01:38:11.019" style="s2">complicated statistics the people are</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.919" end="01:38:12.939" style="s2">using often to cover their tracks but</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.019" end="01:38:15.039" style="s2">sometimes because the data really are</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.939" end="01:38:16.780" style="s2">really do call for complicated</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.039" end="01:38:19.959" style="s2">statistics yes</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.780" end="01:38:22.630" style="s2">but again and I really want to emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.959" end="01:38:24.939" style="s2">if you have some kind of scientific</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.630" end="01:38:26.380" style="s2">background whether its formal or not you</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.939" end="01:38:28.119" style="s2">just have an interest and you&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.380" end="01:38:30.280" style="s2">some time thinking about it check out</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.119" end="01:38:33.189" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with the papers that are</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.280" end="01:38:36.010" style="s2">emerging every day on kovat 19 and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.189" end="01:38:40.510" style="s2">lectures that are being delivered on</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.010" end="01:38:42.880" style="s2">YouTube by one professional to others we</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.510" end="01:38:44.559" style="s2">are this is happening in real time and</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.880" end="01:38:47.139" style="s2">it&#39;s happening the way actual progress</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.559" end="01:38:49.599" style="s2">happens which is to say people are</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.139" end="01:38:51.309" style="s2">disagreeing with each other in public</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.599" end="01:38:53.530" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a stand I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.309" end="01:38:54.789" style="s2">this disease is progressing this way</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.530" end="01:38:56.559" style="s2">because of these things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.789" end="01:38:59.079" style="s2">observed know I&#39;ve observed these other</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.559" end="01:39:02.079" style="s2">things and the point is when it plays</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.079" end="01:39:04.300" style="s2">out in public like that a it has a much</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.079" end="01:39:06.099" style="s2">higher tendency to be honorable where</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.300" end="01:39:08.199" style="s2">you&#39;re playing with your own reputation</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.099" end="01:39:10.749" style="s2">and you&#39;re saying no I think it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.199" end="01:39:14.189" style="s2">way because of this thing well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.749" end="01:39:17.139" style="s2">risky position to take so anyway I guess</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.189" end="01:39:20.380" style="s2">once you start doing this in private and</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.139" end="01:39:22.149" style="s2">you have reasons to you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.380" end="01:39:25.239" style="s2">young you&#39;re engaged in quality control</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.149" end="01:39:26.709" style="s2">I think it&#39;s very hard to rescue that</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.239" end="01:39:29.360" style="s2">system and the reviewers are anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.709" end="01:39:33.110" style="s2">right so anyway let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.360" end="01:39:39.290" style="s2">this in in the open can kovat be</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.110" end="01:39:40.429" style="s2">transmitted through farting I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.290" end="01:39:42.619" style="s2">heard anyone say that</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.429" end="01:39:44.000" style="s2">mostly when people are farting in public</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.619" end="01:39:45.500" style="s2">they&#39;ve got something covering</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.000" end="01:39:47.810" style="s2">themselves right</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.500" end="01:39:51.190" style="s2">but given that apparently it is in fecal</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.810" end="01:39:52.670" style="s2">matter and it could spread through air I</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.190" end="01:39:54.679" style="s2">suppose so</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.670" end="01:39:57.260" style="s2">yeah I mean let&#39;s put it this way you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.679" end="01:39:59.000" style="s2">set kind of a low bar for a can it be</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.260" end="01:40:01.280" style="s2">yeah like yeah you could probably</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.000" end="01:40:03.290" style="s2">generate a scenario on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.280" end="01:40:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a pretty easy scenario to</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.290" end="01:40:09.290" style="s2">prevent from occurring very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.360" end="01:40:11.630" style="s2">yeah though wear underwear yes hey guys</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.290" end="01:40:14.360" style="s2">what do you think why do you think</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.630" end="01:40:15.679" style="s2">anti-semitism is so persistent it seems</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.360" end="01:40:18.320" style="s2">to be rearing its head again at both</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.679" end="01:40:19.219" style="s2">ends of the political spectrum yes it</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.320" end="01:40:28.730" style="s2">does yeah</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.219" end="01:40:30.230" style="s2">yes it does yeah I think well let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.730" end="01:40:32.480" style="s2">it this way we don&#39;t really have the</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.230" end="01:40:35.710" style="s2">bandwidth to do this here but I have</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.480" end="01:40:40.219" style="s2">talked elsewhere about the tendency of</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.710" end="01:40:43.369" style="s2">human populations to seek different</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.219" end="01:40:45.920" style="s2">kinds of growth be it through the</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.369" end="01:40:47.480" style="s2">discovery of new lands the discovery of</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.920" end="01:40:48.500" style="s2">technologies that allow you to do more</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.480" end="01:40:49.909" style="s2">with the lands you already have</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.500" end="01:40:52.219" style="s2">available to you and when those things</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.909" end="01:40:56.000" style="s2">run out our addiction to growth causes</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.219" end="01:40:57.830" style="s2">us to identify populations who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.000" end="01:41:00.350" style="s2">protect can&#39;t defend what they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.830" end="01:41:03.469" style="s2">and to make up reasons to attack them</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.350" end="01:41:05.659" style="s2">and so basically anti-semitism comes</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.469" end="01:41:08.090" style="s2">down to the fact of Jews being an</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.659" end="01:41:09.949" style="s2">unusual population that lives at low</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.090" end="01:41:12.980" style="s2">density in many places it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.949" end="01:41:15.320" style="s2">diaspora population and not all of it</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.980" end="01:41:17.510" style="s2">obviously but a large fraction of it and</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.320" end="01:41:20.540" style="s2">so that large fraction is always</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.510" end="01:41:25.639" style="s2">vulnerable to the population that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.540" end="01:41:28.850" style="s2">Jewish turning their or turning on them</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.639" end="01:41:31.580" style="s2">and so anyway I think it I&#39;ve my first</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.850" end="01:41:37.610" style="s2">evolutionary project actually was a</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.580" end="01:41:40.280" style="s2">paper arguing that anti-semitism evolves</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.610" end="01:41:42.910" style="s2">and that it has to be stopped that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.280" end="01:41:46.240" style="s2">basically a rationalization</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.910" end="01:41:49.480" style="s2">or lineage against lineage genocide or</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.240" end="01:41:53.260" style="s2">warfare and that is frankly not that</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.480" end="01:41:55.840" style="s2">hard to understand good we&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.260" end="01:42:00.010" style="s2">to be a little speedier speedier yeah</p>

<p begin="01:46:03.490" end="01:46:07.469" style="s2">in public where presumably we&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="01:46:15.510" end="01:46:23.360" style="s2">is there are lots and lots of indicators</p>

<p begin="01:46:34.770" end="01:46:40.590" style="s2">a distinction so thank you Gaming size</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.290" end="01:46:43.400" style="s2">and motility yeah so if you have if you</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.590" end="01:46:46.290" style="s2">are and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve said this elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.400" end="01:46:47.790" style="s2">and and I have to if you are a biologist</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.290" end="01:46:51.090" style="s2">in the field and you discover a new</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.790" end="01:46:52.680" style="s2">species and it somehow you just you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.090" end="01:46:53.610" style="s2">no idea what&#39;s going on with it and</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.680" end="01:46:55.350" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of species out there</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.610" end="01:46:57.719" style="s2">where you can&#39;t tell if you know</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.350" end="01:47:00.570" style="s2">typically are behaviorally if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.719" end="01:47:03.030" style="s2">male or female if you find that one of</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.570" end="01:47:06.239" style="s2">them that one individual has gametes</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.030" end="01:47:08.430" style="s2">that are large ish larger than average</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.239" end="01:47:10.050" style="s2">cells within that within that organism</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.430" end="01:47:11.310" style="s2">and sessile don&#39;t tend to move and</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.050" end="01:47:13.770" style="s2">that&#39;s a female you got in your hands</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.310" end="01:47:15.960" style="s2">and if you have gametes that are very</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.770" end="01:47:18.330" style="s2">small stripped of cytoplasm and tend to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.960" end="01:47:19.620" style="s2">be speedy at least in some parts of</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.330" end="01:47:22.860" style="s2">their lifecycle</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.620" end="01:47:25.110" style="s2">there you have a male so sperm or pollen</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.860" end="01:47:27.449" style="s2">being the animal and plant versions of</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.110" end="01:47:29.910" style="s2">the male gametes and eggs being a female</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.449" end="01:47:32.660" style="s2">and yeah it really does it really does</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.910" end="01:47:34.560" style="s2">make it simple yeah it is just the</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.660" end="01:47:38.699" style="s2">fundamental underlying what the</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.560" end="01:47:40.620" style="s2">distinction is let&#39;s see is it possible</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.699" end="01:47:43.110" style="s2">to detect a less lethal mutation right</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.620" end="01:47:49.830" style="s2">now and try to purposefully spread that</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.110" end="01:47:53.310" style="s2">mutation this is in effect hmm I want to</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.830" end="01:47:55.440" style="s2">I want to go that far I&#39;ve been toying a</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.310" end="01:47:59.219" style="s2">lot with the question about sub-lethal</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.440" end="01:48:00.989" style="s2">infections here and one of the questions</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.219" end="01:48:03.270" style="s2">which I really I would love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.989" end="01:48:08.030" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s well-versed in this who</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.270" end="01:48:08.030" style="s2">knows the answer if it was true that</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.630" end="01:48:16.110" style="s2">infections that do not that are</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.040" end="01:48:18.540" style="s2">asymptomatic are not destructive and not</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.110" end="01:48:20.699" style="s2">frequently transmitted which is</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.540" end="01:48:24.120" style="s2">plausible because it is the distress</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.699" end="01:48:26.969" style="s2">that causes symptoms and it is also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.120" end="01:48:29.429" style="s2">the lesions that are spilling virus into</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.969" end="01:48:31.710" style="s2">your lungs or wherever that are causing</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.429" end="01:48:33.960" style="s2">the transmission so if it were true that</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.710" end="01:48:36.330" style="s2">an asymptomatic case was not destructive</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.960" end="01:48:38.250" style="s2">to your body or not very destructive to</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.330" end="01:48:40.350" style="s2">your body and not highly transmissible</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.250" end="01:48:43.500" style="s2">then in effect it functions like a</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.350" end="01:48:46.260" style="s2">vaccine if on the other hand it is true</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.500" end="01:48:48.000" style="s2">and the virus wins in a way it slows</p>

<p begin="01:48:48.000" end="01:48:53.190" style="s2">never ends up in a host it dies well and</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.820" end="01:48:55.949" style="s2">this is we&#39;ve been saying since our</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.190" end="01:49:00.239" style="s2">first live stream that there tends to be</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.949" end="01:49:03.540" style="s2">an evolution towards a lower virulence a</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.239" end="01:49:06.230" style="s2">lower virulence lower damage infection</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.540" end="01:49:09.660" style="s2">over time and this would be that</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.230" end="01:49:12.090" style="s2">accelerating so you know the virus</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.660" end="01:49:13.980" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to make you sick it wants</p>

<p begin="01:49:13.980" end="01:49:20.190" style="s2">is a fair shorthand here and so to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.830" end="01:49:22.770" style="s2">passed on a symptomatically would be</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.190" end="01:49:26.040" style="s2">fine and anyway there&#39;s a question about</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.770" end="01:49:27.780" style="s2">whether or not the host is the place</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.040" end="01:49:29.969" style="s2">where this evolution takes place which i</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.780" end="01:49:31.590" style="s2">think in general that is but there will</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.969" end="01:49:33.989" style="s2">also be some evolution on the part of</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.590" end="01:49:38.070" style="s2">the the viruses and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.989" end="01:49:41.070" style="s2">less lethal ones spread it is likely to</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.070" end="01:49:42.300" style="s2">our benefit but you know I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.070" end="01:49:44.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know where we are and I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.300" end="01:49:47.190" style="s2">know what is true in these asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.040" end="01:49:49.830" style="s2">cases respected damage and you know in</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.190" end="01:49:53.310" style="s2">and further infections we need so much</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.830" end="01:49:55.560" style="s2">more information than we have know is</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.310" end="01:49:57.150" style="s2">hydrochloric win and I had said</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.560" end="01:49:59.160" style="s2">hydrochloric won at one point I and I</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.150" end="01:50:00.570" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually hydroxychloroquine I</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.160" end="01:50:02.400" style="s2">think I said Hydra clerk when are you</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.570" end="01:50:04.110" style="s2">corrected me but I had in an earlier</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.400" end="01:50:07.530" style="s2">episode I think with hydrochloric so I</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.110" end="01:50:09.000" style="s2">put that in your head is a drug see</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.530" end="01:50:11.489" style="s2">chloroquine used to essentially keep the</p>

<p begin="01:50:18.900" end="01:50:23.850" style="s2">either it tends to do in the case of</p>

<p begin="01:50:23.850" end="01:50:28.949" style="s2">think it&#39;s mechanism of action against</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.650" end="01:50:31.260" style="s2">kovat 19 is yeah I think that I want to</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.949" end="01:50:32.750" style="s2">look this one up and figure out if we</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.260" end="01:50:36.140" style="s2">can say something can</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.750" end="01:50:37.010" style="s2">nice about it next time okay thanks</p>

<p begin="01:50:45.200" end="01:50:50.060" style="s2">we have plans probably after our book</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.090" end="01:50:51.950" style="s2">emerges I think we will endeavor to get</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.060" end="01:50:52.780" style="s2">to put some flesh on those bones yeah</p>

<p begin="01:51:06.020" end="01:51:11.030" style="s2">maybe the first Q&amp;A that we did</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.140" end="01:51:12.920" style="s2">yep and neither of us looked into it</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.030" end="01:51:14.900" style="s2">afterwards we both had some exposure I</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.920" end="01:51:16.700" style="s2">looked into it a little but not enough</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.900" end="01:51:18.650" style="s2">to say yet I&#39;m still I&#39;m still curious</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.700" end="01:51:21.890" style="s2">about what he&#39;s still a possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.650" end="01:51:23.150" style="s2">I think it is what what Jamie Jamie will</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.890" end="01:51:26.600" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.150" end="01:51:29.450" style="s2">and you know he he he Jamie knows what</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.600" end="01:51:31.070" style="s2">he&#39;s doing and I you know I trust that</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.450" end="01:51:32.600" style="s2">if he thinks that something is valuable</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.070" end="01:51:37.610" style="s2">it probably has at least some value to</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.600" end="01:51:40.600" style="s2">it yep okay um kovat released on purpose</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.610" end="01:51:40.600" style="s2">says who Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.640" end="01:51:45.590" style="s2">I think what we said last time was that</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.590" end="01:51:48.590" style="s2">it seemed unlikely this was released on</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.590" end="01:51:51.560" style="s2">purpose and likely that this was</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.590" end="01:51:56.630" style="s2">released by accident from a laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.560" end="01:51:58.760" style="s2">in Wuhan yep but but it&#39;s open yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.630" end="01:52:00.500" style="s2">don&#39;t know does the current working</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.760" end="01:52:02.180" style="s2">assumption that this is not a bioweapon</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.500" end="01:52:03.920" style="s2">prevent treatment protocols to be more</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.180" end="01:52:11.750" style="s2">flexible and limit the research focus</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.920" end="01:52:14.690" style="s2">thank you my assumption from the</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.750" end="01:52:16.160" style="s2">beginning has been there comes a point</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.690" end="01:52:18.260" style="s2">if this was a weapon</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.160" end="01:52:20.860" style="s2">then it would predict certain things</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.260" end="01:52:23.450" style="s2">about it but until we have evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.860" end="01:52:27.620" style="s2">positively suggests that it is actually</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.450" end="01:52:30.730" style="s2">a weapon that it doesn&#39;t add anything we</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.620" end="01:52:35.300" style="s2">would do the same thing yeah at a</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.730" end="01:52:36.650" style="s2">epidemiological level and so again I</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.300" end="01:52:39.380" style="s2">want to see the evidence that says it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.650" end="01:52:42.890" style="s2">worth our time to pursue the this is a</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.380" end="01:52:45.090" style="s2">bioweapon line of inquiry and until I</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.890" end="01:52:46.889" style="s2">see that my sense is</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.090" end="01:52:49.500" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to get distracted by it</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.889" end="01:52:53.030" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re drowning in a sea of</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.500" end="01:52:55.530" style="s2">misinformation and under information and</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.030" end="01:52:57.420" style="s2">trying to imagine all the possible ways</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.530" end="01:52:58.739" style="s2">that you know like a switch could have</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.420" end="01:53:00.570" style="s2">been built into this if it was a bio</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.739" end="01:53:02.849" style="s2">weapon that could change what it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.570" end="01:53:06.270" style="s2">like who knows it&#39;s an infinite it just</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.849" end="01:53:08.460" style="s2">opens up the those possibilities to</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.270" end="01:53:10.020" style="s2">infinity and we already don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.460" end="01:53:14.670" style="s2">enough we already can&#39;t limit the</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.020" end="01:53:16.380" style="s2">degrees of freedom enough yeah watch all</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.670" end="01:53:19.349" style="s2">your vids keep it up if you can thank</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.380" end="01:53:21.150" style="s2">you carbon monoxide therapy for kovat</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.349" end="01:53:22.800" style="s2">patients I can&#39;t find out if anyone has</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.150" end="01:53:24.300" style="s2">tried this clinically I was reading on</p>
<p begin="01:53:22.800" end="01:53:26.280" style="s2">the connection with malaria vaccines</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.300" end="01:53:29.550" style="s2">enough vaccines and stumbled across</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.280" end="01:53:32.099" style="s2">fascinating legette research so again if</p>
<p begin="01:53:29.550" end="01:53:34.380" style="s2">you are referring to fascinating legit</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.099" end="01:53:39.090" style="s2">research link it here or find some other</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.380" end="01:53:40.980" style="s2">way to link it I don&#39;t know carbon</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.090" end="01:53:42.420" style="s2">monoxide therapy seems sounds very</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.980" end="01:53:46.860" style="s2">dangerous so my understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.420" end="01:53:50.760" style="s2">carbon monoxide binds hemoglobin better</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.860" end="01:53:53.489" style="s2">than oxygen and co2 thus displacing them</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.760" end="01:53:57.840" style="s2">yeah so I can easily imagine you making</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.489" end="01:53:59.400" style="s2">a case of kovat 19 vastly worse on the</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.840" end="01:54:01.969" style="s2">other hand you would need to I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.400" end="01:54:04.580" style="s2">it was like a way of pulling out the</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.969" end="01:54:06.650" style="s2">hemoglobin that&#39;s been attacked and then</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.580" end="01:54:09.780" style="s2">simultaneous with blood transfusion from</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.650" end="01:54:10.739" style="s2">health yeah I wouldn&#39;t want anybody who</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.780" end="01:54:13.199" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what they were doing</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.739" end="01:54:16.139" style="s2">experimenting with yeah carbon monoxide</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.199" end="01:54:18.630" style="s2">yeah why isn&#39;t the dorfmann method used</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.139" end="01:54:21.540" style="s2">anywhere I don&#39;t know yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.630" end="01:54:23.190" style="s2">why isn&#39;t dorfman method used anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.540" end="01:54:26.449" style="s2">what&#39;s the dorfmann method what is the</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.190" end="01:54:28.290" style="s2">Dorf I&#39;m glad you well no chalk board</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.449" end="01:54:29.639" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t know what the Dorfman</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.290" end="01:54:31.230" style="s2">method is so yeah it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.639" end="01:54:33.210" style="s2">matter even though you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.230" end="01:54:35.190" style="s2">it is yeah do you have the uncut</p>

<p begin="01:54:41.699" end="01:54:48.719" style="s2">intentionally Pangburn was I believe</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.570" end="01:54:51.420" style="s2">being a cheapskate and decided not to</p>

<p begin="01:54:51.420" end="01:54:55.409" style="s2">it was being recorded on a handycam now</p>

<p begin="01:54:58.770" end="01:55:05.430" style="s2">that was the case until a fragmented</p>

<p begin="01:55:13.290" end="01:55:20.100" style="s2">nowhere but if the Chicago Theatre has a</p>

<p begin="01:55:24.900" end="01:55:28.770" style="s2">it&#39;d be great we don&#39;t have it and as</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.180" end="01:55:30.360" style="s2">far as we know penguin doesn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.770" end="01:55:32.400" style="s2">either and no it does it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.360" end="01:55:37.740" style="s2">like that was intentional on his part</p>

<p begin="01:55:37.740" end="01:55:41.490" style="s2">two questions the being of this chat we</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.300" end="01:55:45.480" style="s2">just don&#39;t have them man if they started</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.490" end="01:55:47.040" style="s2">before regarding athletics and exercise</p>
<p begin="01:55:45.480" end="01:55:49.860" style="s2">how does the impact of tearing down</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.040" end="01:55:55.500" style="s2">muscle apply to cellular senescence does</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.860" end="01:55:56.970" style="s2">the speed up the aging process I&#39;m so I</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.500" end="01:56:01.400" style="s2">think I know what this question is about</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.970" end="01:56:04.290" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s long been evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.400" end="01:56:06.300" style="s2">athletic activity does not advance</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.290" end="01:56:08.430" style="s2">senescence which is at first pass</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.300" end="01:56:10.980" style="s2">paradoxical because it involves some</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.430" end="01:56:13.140" style="s2">wear and tear on the other hand muscle</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.980" end="01:56:17.340" style="s2">is an unusual tissue because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.140" end="01:56:20.130" style="s2">multinucleate and so the tendency for</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.340" end="01:56:23.780" style="s2">cellular reproduction to runaway in</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.130" end="01:56:27.030" style="s2">muscle at least striated muscle is</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.780" end="01:56:29.820" style="s2">greatly reduced but there may be other</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.030" end="01:56:31.050" style="s2">pathologies that look like it so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.820" end="01:56:34.140" style="s2">know the answer to the question but</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.050" end="01:56:37.280" style="s2">let&#39;s just say first step would be</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.140" end="01:56:39.990" style="s2">recognizing that skeletal muscle is</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.280" end="01:56:42.720" style="s2">distinct in its cellular nature and</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.990" end="01:56:44.970" style="s2">therefore doesn&#39;t fit in the same</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.720" end="01:56:48.630" style="s2">trade-off matrix or it doesn&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.970" end="01:56:50.430" style="s2">the same way all right could you talk</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.630" end="01:56:51.630" style="s2">about Gilbert&#39;s syndrome why it was</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.430" end="01:56:55.410" style="s2">selected for and how it&#39;s linked to</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.630" end="01:56:56.730" style="s2">hemoglobin could relate to Koba 19 wow I</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.410" end="01:56:58.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know what Gilbert&#39;s syndrome is II</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.730" end="01:57:03.570" style="s2">I am far better versed in sullivan</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.650" end="01:57:04.830" style="s2">syndrome sorry I don&#39;t mean reserve now</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.570" end="01:57:07.200" style="s2">we just wait I mean there&#39;s just two</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.830" end="01:57:10.250" style="s2">very quickly that we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.200" end="01:57:10.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.870" end="01:57:20.770" style="s2">do antibodies to antibodies after</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.210" end="01:57:22.390" style="s2">infection mean immunity okay so this is</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.770" end="01:57:24.040" style="s2">written interestingly I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.390" end="01:57:26.770" style="s2">you can see it do antibodies after</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.040" end="01:57:30.070" style="s2">infection mean immunity over inability</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.770" end="01:57:32.890" style="s2">to infect others over inability to</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.070" end="01:57:35.560" style="s2">become reinfected I&#39;m not I&#39;d say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.890" end="01:57:36.760" style="s2">slashes right yeah but there&#39;s also fits</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.560" end="01:57:38.110" style="s2">all of these three things fancy</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.760" end="01:57:40.570" style="s2">parentheses and those three things are</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.110" end="01:57:42.730" style="s2">immunity immunity inability to infect</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.570" end="01:57:45.640" style="s2">others and inability to become</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.730" end="01:57:47.530" style="s2">reinfected oh okay I got it</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.640" end="01:57:48.820" style="s2">so do if you have antibodies after</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.530" end="01:57:50.650" style="s2">infection does that mean these three</p>
<p begin="01:57:48.820" end="01:57:53.200" style="s2">things doesn&#39;t mean you are immune that</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.650" end="01:57:54.190" style="s2">you cannot infect others and you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.200" end="01:57:56.770" style="s2">become reinfected</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.190" end="01:58:00.490" style="s2">we think so yes oh it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.770" end="01:58:02.620" style="s2">anybody&#39;s right if if you test positive</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.490" end="01:58:05.380" style="s2">for a serology tests actually antibody</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.620" end="01:58:08.170" style="s2">test the presence of your antibodies</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.380" end="01:58:11.860" style="s2">indicate that well the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.170" end="01:58:13.660" style="s2">antibodies says you were exposed yes if</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.860" end="01:58:15.280" style="s2">exposure you&#39;ve had a strong enough</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.660" end="01:58:18.100" style="s2">immune response to producing a body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.280" end="01:58:20.590" style="s2">yeah if your immune response is the</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.100" end="01:58:22.870" style="s2">result of having been infected what we</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.590" end="01:58:25.000" style="s2">assume and I think now have pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.870" end="01:58:26.560" style="s2">evidence we don&#39;t see a lot of double</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.000" end="01:58:29.470" style="s2">infections people who recover and then</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.560" end="01:58:31.330" style="s2">get sick again we&#39;ve seen none there are</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.470" end="01:58:33.070" style="s2">a couple of cases that Nicholas</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.330" end="01:58:36.250" style="s2">Christakis was talking about early on</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.070" end="01:58:39.010" style="s2">that he thinks were due to the problem</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.250" end="01:58:40.570" style="s2">of false negatives right that people</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.010" end="01:58:42.340" style="s2">appeared to have been recovered tested</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.570" end="01:58:44.230" style="s2">negative and then tested positive again</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.340" end="01:58:45.490" style="s2">but probably just hadn&#39;t had not</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.230" end="01:58:47.050" style="s2">recovered yet</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.490" end="01:58:48.970" style="s2">but the short answer those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.050" end="01:58:51.910" style="s2">serology tests those were antigen test</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.970" end="01:58:54.100" style="s2">PCR tests yeah the mechanism is what are</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.910" end="01:58:56.080" style="s2">called memory cells and at some point I</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.100" end="01:58:57.970" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna put together a lecture</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.080" end="01:59:00.160" style="s2">on how the immune system works it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.970" end="01:59:03.700" style="s2">of the most stunning things I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.160" end="01:59:06.280" style="s2">heard and it&#39;s well worth exploring at</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.700" end="01:59:10.000" style="s2">an evolutionary level but the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.280" end="01:59:11.950" style="s2">your body fights an infection at the as</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.000" end="01:59:15.970" style="s2">its fighting it has effectively an army</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.950" end="01:59:18.430" style="s2">of cells that are specifically targeted</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.970" end="01:59:20.710" style="s2">at the infectious agent and it fights</p>
<p begin="01:59:18.430" end="01:59:24.160" style="s2">this battle and eventually if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.710" end="01:59:24.860" style="s2">die of it it wins when it wins that army</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.160" end="01:59:27.170" style="s2">edit</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.860" end="01:59:28.730" style="s2">down and you create what are called</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.170" end="01:59:31.820" style="s2">memory cells in these memory cells</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.730" end="01:59:33.770" style="s2">remember the formula for defeating that</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.820" end="01:59:36.590" style="s2">enemy and so if you are challenged with</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.770" end="01:59:38.900" style="s2">another particle a viral particle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.590" end="01:59:40.880" style="s2">close enough then the infection never</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.900" end="01:59:43.790" style="s2">gets far enough for you to detect that</p>
<p begin="01:59:40.880" end="01:59:46.369" style="s2">you had another encounter so it&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.790" end="01:59:49.690" style="s2">memory cells that would do it so in</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.369" end="01:59:52.130" style="s2">order to get to the three things were</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.690" end="01:59:54.380" style="s2">you can&#39;t be infected again</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.130" end="02:00:00.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t infect others and what was the</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.380" end="02:00:01.850" style="s2">third one and you are immune I guess in</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.440" end="02:00:04.070" style="s2">some ways that&#39;s the same yes the same</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.850" end="02:00:06.080" style="s2">one and three are the same thing so the</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.070" end="02:00:08.119" style="s2">answer is if the if the virus doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.080" end="02:00:09.619" style="s2">evolve too quickly then probably having</p>
<p begin="02:00:08.119" end="02:00:11.420" style="s2">had it once is enough to prevent you</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.619" end="02:00:13.850" style="s2">from ever getting it again because your</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.420" end="02:00:17.030" style="s2">memory cells will persist and they will</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.850" end="02:00:18.739" style="s2">spot it the next time it shows up and at</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.030" end="02:00:20.300" style="s2">the point that you fully recover unless</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.739" end="02:00:22.880" style="s2">it&#39;s one of these viruses that retreats</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.300" end="02:00:26.750" style="s2">to some tissue which I think we would</p>
<p begin="02:00:22.880" end="02:00:27.800" style="s2">also know that already do you think yeah</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.750" end="02:00:29.510" style="s2">because I think we&#39;d see some</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.800" end="02:00:31.790" style="s2">recurrences that wouldn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.510" end="02:00:34.670" style="s2">unless it&#39;s a longer term re-emergence</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.790" end="02:00:36.800" style="s2">oh yeah five acts malaria well my guess</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.670" end="02:00:38.540" style="s2">is wait for months or years yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.800" end="02:00:41.060" style="s2">think but again that&#39;s that&#39;s malaria</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.540" end="02:00:43.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not a virus but there are viruses</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.060" end="02:00:45.110" style="s2">to do it and I just don&#39;t know that we</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.010" end="02:00:46.850" style="s2">have seen a corona virus that does this</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.110" end="02:00:48.409" style="s2">so in other words it&#39;s resident in a</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.850" end="02:00:51.530" style="s2">population but it&#39;s not that it hides in</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.409" end="02:00:54.440" style="s2">a tissue of an individual so assuming</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.530" end="02:00:57.020" style="s2">you beat the pathogen you&#39;re free of</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.440" end="02:00:59.090" style="s2">active particles hiding out in some</p>
<p begin="02:00:57.020" end="02:01:00.290" style="s2">tissue and you have memory cells that</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.090" end="02:01:02.270" style="s2">can spawn it than all three of those</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.290" end="02:01:04.550" style="s2">conditions will obtain which may</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.270" end="02:01:07.520" style="s2">actually be two conditions yeah a study</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.550" end="02:01:09.800" style="s2">shows SARS two effects a stew in testes</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.520" end="02:01:13.040" style="s2">decreasing testosterone with elderly</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.800" end="02:01:17.150" style="s2">compromised unhealthy and dense groups</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.040" end="02:01:18.530" style="s2">thoughts on depopulation well if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.150" end="02:01:21.440" style="s2">affecting the elderly it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.530" end="02:01:24.889" style="s2">have much of an effect yep and you know</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.440" end="02:01:27.949" style="s2">it it it does it clearly is affecting or</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.889" end="02:01:29.570" style="s2">it&#39;s killing men and making higher rates</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.949" end="02:01:31.460" style="s2">than it&#39;s killing women and it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.570" end="02:01:36.170" style="s2">men sicker when they do get sick then</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.460" end="02:01:37.820" style="s2">it&#39;s making women but men aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.170" end="02:01:39.560" style="s2">limit on population size</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.820" end="02:01:43.430" style="s2">so it&#39;s unlikely to affect population</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.560" end="02:01:46.970" style="s2">yep clothes get darker when wet because</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.430" end="02:01:49.870" style="s2">of like light trapping see do I also is</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.970" end="02:01:53.840" style="s2">dyslexia an evolutionary adaptation mmm</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.870" end="02:01:58.310" style="s2">all right let&#39;s talk dyslexia here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.840" end="02:02:01.490" style="s2">thing dyslexia is a kind of a garbage</p>

<p begin="02:02:01.490" end="02:02:06.290" style="s2">that interfere with what is considered</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.230" end="02:02:08.420" style="s2">normal reading in my opinion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.290" end="02:02:10.460" style="s2">really a disability because reading is</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.420" end="02:02:13.310" style="s2">too new in other words to say that</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.460" end="02:02:15.380" style="s2">somebody like me is I&#39;m not against</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.310" end="02:02:17.690" style="s2">being defective but in this case to say</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.380" end="02:02:20.480" style="s2">that somebody like me who has challenges</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.690" end="02:02:22.970" style="s2">when reading is defective pays no heed</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.480" end="02:02:25.910" style="s2">to the fact that reading at a maximum</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.970" end="02:02:28.040" style="s2">goes back 8,000 years and wasn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.910" end="02:02:32.030" style="s2">common feature of a human existence</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.040" end="02:02:33.560" style="s2">until a few hundred years ago and so we</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.030" end="02:02:36.470" style="s2">basically are not evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.560" end="02:02:39.080" style="s2">prepared for it</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.470" end="02:02:41.480" style="s2">so what I would say is it is a novelty</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.080" end="02:02:45.710" style="s2">problem where reading is novel you</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.480" end="02:02:47.950" style="s2">probably have a bail distribution of you</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.710" end="02:02:50.510" style="s2">know how good you are at reading and</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.950" end="02:02:53.390" style="s2">there&#39;s some arbitrary threshold at</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.510" end="02:02:58.370" style="s2">which we decide that your reading is</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.390" end="02:03:01.370" style="s2">compromised enough that you have a some</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.370" end="02:03:03.980" style="s2">kind of a failure a system failure but</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.370" end="02:03:06.110" style="s2">that that&#39;s arbitrary and my argument</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.980" end="02:03:07.910" style="s2">would be everybody is dyslexic when</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.110" end="02:03:11.030" style="s2">they&#39;re tired or their glasses are dirty</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.910" end="02:03:12.620" style="s2">you know or there&#39;s loud music playing</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.030" end="02:03:14.320" style="s2">right there&#39;s lots of things that can</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.620" end="02:03:16.880" style="s2">interfere and some of us are just</p>

<p begin="02:03:16.880" end="02:03:22.400" style="s2">under decent lighting and so it gets</p>

<p begin="02:03:28.760" end="02:03:34.670" style="s2">solutions elsewhere so as we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.910" end="02:03:36.980" style="s2">about elsewhere dyslexia is one of these</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.670" end="02:03:38.750" style="s2">I don&#39;t think of myself as doing n runs</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.980" end="02:03:40.430" style="s2">again around the dominant paradigm I</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.750" end="02:03:42.560" style="s2">think if my self as running circles</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.430" end="02:03:48.970" style="s2">around the dominant paradigm yes you do</p>

<p begin="02:03:50.790" end="02:03:55.380" style="s2">left-handedness there are all sorts of</p>

<p begin="02:03:59.610" end="02:04:06.290" style="s2">you&#39;re forced into solution making that</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.660" end="02:04:10.430" style="s2">looks different and it often ends up</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.290" end="02:04:10.430" style="s2">resulting in pretty heterodox thinking</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.730" end="02:04:14.670" style="s2">can the earth be considered an organism</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.260" end="02:04:18.590" style="s2">or super organism from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.670" end="02:04:20.730" style="s2">biological perspective no it&#39;s too flat</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.590" end="02:04:23.190" style="s2">can it be considered an organism no</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.730" end="02:04:24.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not an organism no nor is it a</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.190" end="02:04:26.460" style="s2">super organism nope</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.600" end="02:04:29.250" style="s2">just like forests don&#39;t evolve the earth</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.460" end="02:04:32.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t evolve we have shared fate here</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.250" end="02:04:35.730" style="s2">on the earth but that does not mean that</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.700" end="02:04:38.040" style="s2">it is an organism or a super organism my</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.730" end="02:04:39.960" style="s2">previous question and I don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.040" end="02:04:41.460" style="s2">that was was intent to discover whether</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.960" end="02:04:43.080" style="s2">you believe it is possible that non</p>

<p begin="02:04:43.080" end="02:04:48.930" style="s2">counted as covin oh yeah it&#39;s possible I</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.160" end="02:04:50.970" style="s2">think there&#39;s not a ton of it probably</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.930" end="02:04:53.100" style="s2">going on but it&#39;s certainly possible</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.970" end="02:04:55.200" style="s2">that some are although I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.100" end="02:04:57.630" style="s2">almost certain that some are by virtue</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.200" end="02:05:00.540" style="s2">of the fact that you have everything</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.630" end="02:05:04.890" style="s2">through asymptomatic cases of kovat and</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.540" end="02:05:06.750" style="s2">so people come into the hospital and you</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.890" end="02:05:08.520" style="s2">die it&#39;s gonna be classified as we</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.750" end="02:05:10.740" style="s2">happen but we don&#39;t know how we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.520" end="02:05:13.170" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s enough to make a dent</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.740" end="02:05:14.670" style="s2">in what we think is going on or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.170" end="02:05:18.120" style="s2">just the rare case but it&#39;s certain not</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.670" end="02:05:19.890" style="s2">to be zero right good is there</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.120" end="02:05:21.810" style="s2">compromise between protection for Cova</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.890" end="02:05:23.400" style="s2">19 while allowing the economy to work</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.810" end="02:05:25.020" style="s2">perhaps continue telecommute</p>

<p begin="02:05:30.230" end="02:05:37.620" style="s2">so far I see almost no economies no</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.570" end="02:05:40.290" style="s2">nation states making plans and there is</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.620" end="02:05:43.290" style="s2">reference to what South Korea did which</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.290" end="02:05:48.180" style="s2">was pretty damn effective but there is</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.290" end="02:05:51.750" style="s2">such a paucity of testing in the US and</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.180" end="02:05:53.880" style="s2">Europe anyway that what are we supposed</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.750" end="02:05:56.130" style="s2">to do before we know what percentage of</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.880" end="02:05:57.570" style="s2">the populace has been infected and</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.130" end="02:05:59.940" style="s2">therefore what the actual case fatality</p>
<p begin="02:05:57.570" end="02:06:02.310" style="s2">rate is yeah it&#39;s high transmissibility</p>
<p begin="02:05:59.940" end="02:06:04.599" style="s2">if the case fatality rate is ten times</p>
<p begin="02:06:02.310" end="02:06:06.340" style="s2">the flu but not 100</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.599" end="02:06:10.329" style="s2">the flu it&#39;s a totally different</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.340" end="02:06:12.039" style="s2">landscape have 2% of the US population</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.329" end="02:06:16.809" style="s2">at this point been exposed and infected</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.039" end="02:06:18.969" style="s2">or 20% or 50% we have no idea fine now</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.809" end="02:06:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to find out and it seems like</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.969" end="02:06:23.109" style="s2">that just I hate it when people make</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.760" end="02:06:24.459" style="s2">these arguments but it just doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.109" end="02:06:27.429" style="s2">like it should be as hard as it seems to</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.459" end="02:06:30.219" style="s2">be yes I would also say we should figure</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.429" end="02:06:33.429" style="s2">out how to be surgical about what work</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.219" end="02:06:35.109" style="s2">we stopped and what work we allow even</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.429" end="02:06:36.159" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t come into play here even</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.109" end="02:06:38.229" style="s2">if we were on the verge of a</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.159" end="02:06:40.359" style="s2">breakthrough and I must say at the</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.229" end="02:06:42.820" style="s2">vaccine if it comes is going to be a</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.359" end="02:06:46.269" style="s2">long way off I&#39;ve now seen proper</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.820" end="02:06:48.340" style="s2">analysis that suggests that but whatever</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.269" end="02:06:51.129" style="s2">the mechanism that gets us through kovat</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.340" end="02:06:52.840" style="s2">19 this is probably not the last time we</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.129" end="02:06:55.929" style="s2">will face it and so figuring out how</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.840" end="02:07:00.159" style="s2">work continues without allowing an</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.929" end="02:07:01.899" style="s2">epidemic to continue spreading manure</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.159" end="02:07:03.909" style="s2">that out now it&#39;s not going to get</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.899" end="02:07:06.129" style="s2">easier and this is this is our moment</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.909" end="02:07:10.209" style="s2">because we&#39;ve already done a lot of the</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.129" end="02:07:12.099" style="s2">heavy lifting yeah and I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.209" end="02:07:15.249" style="s2">other places how other jurisdictions are</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.099" end="02:07:17.199" style="s2">defining essential services but you know</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.249" end="02:07:19.409" style="s2">in in Portland anyway and I think I</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.199" end="02:07:21.969" style="s2">assume throughout the state of Oregon</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.409" end="02:07:24.129" style="s2">hardware stores are open nurseries are</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.969" end="02:07:27.879" style="s2">open Landscaping Supply places are open</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.129" end="02:07:29.889" style="s2">and for us this means that we can you</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.879" end="02:07:31.719" style="s2">know we&#39;re still you know stuck and</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.889" end="02:07:33.789" style="s2">there&#39;s tremendous amount of restriction</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.719" end="02:07:36.249" style="s2">in terms of what we can do but we are</p>
<p begin="02:07:33.789" end="02:07:39.849" style="s2">able to continue to do a lot of work in</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.249" end="02:07:41.739" style="s2">and around our house that you know could</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.849" end="02:07:44.530" style="s2">have easily been delay into for you know</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.739" end="02:07:46.289" style="s2">months or years and so you know in what</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.530" end="02:07:48.939" style="s2">way is a nursery an essential service</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.289" end="02:07:51.550" style="s2">you you can&#39;t make that argument from</p>
<p begin="02:07:48.939" end="02:07:53.469" style="s2">the perspective of you know I&#39;ll die if</p>
<p begin="02:07:51.550" end="02:07:56.649" style="s2">I don&#39;t have this plant on the other</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.469" end="02:07:59.709" style="s2">hand for those people who do spend time</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.649" end="02:08:01.449" style="s2">outside and plant their own plants it is</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.709" end="02:08:02.919" style="s2">potentially a difference between coming</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.449" end="02:08:08.999" style="s2">out of the psychologically intact and</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.919" end="02:08:12.340" style="s2">not yep how many more do we have we have</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.999" end="02:08:17.169" style="s2">okay good no I see closer to ten but oh</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.340" end="02:08:18.910" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not let&#39;s see sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.169" end="02:08:21.140" style="s2">trying to figure out where I was</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.910" end="02:08:22.670" style="s2">previously you spoke of kovat being able</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.140" end="02:08:23.210" style="s2">to switch its behavior to mutate more</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.670" end="02:08:25.160" style="s2">easily</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.210" end="02:08:26.840" style="s2">what possible mechanism could do this</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.160" end="02:08:29.270" style="s2">and be accurate</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.840" end="02:08:30.890" style="s2">well mutation generally isn&#39;t accurate</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.270" end="02:08:33.140" style="s2">unless the mutations would cause it to</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.890" end="02:08:36.560" style="s2">fail and then those very very mutations</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.140" end="02:08:39.890" style="s2">that worked would would be selected for</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.560" end="02:08:43.480" style="s2">and proceed yep a facultative program</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.890" end="02:08:46.640" style="s2">that allowed greater variation when</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.480" end="02:08:48.920" style="s2">something told some strain of the virus</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.640" end="02:08:50.690" style="s2">that it was in a cul-de-sac</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.920" end="02:08:54.170" style="s2">it could be advantageous not saying it</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.690" end="02:08:55.670" style="s2">happens but it&#39;s possible absolutely can</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.170" end="02:08:57.560" style="s2">you explain if it is possible for the</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.670" end="02:08:59.150" style="s2">virus to have spread from a bat biting</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.560" end="02:09:02.120" style="s2">an animal that was then consumed by</p>
<p begin="02:08:59.150" end="02:09:04.940" style="s2">humans we don&#39;t know but it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.120" end="02:09:05.810" style="s2">plausible hmm it&#39;s pretty unlikely for</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.940" end="02:09:08.450" style="s2">one thing we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.810" end="02:09:10.970" style="s2">horseshoe bat but but again you know is</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.450" end="02:09:14.990" style="s2">it might be zero but it&#39;s possibly not</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.970" end="02:09:16.760" style="s2">zero much more likely that a bat I mean</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.990" end="02:09:19.340" style="s2">especially if this thing is depleting</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.760" end="02:09:22.070" style="s2">oxygen capacity either by messing up the</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.340" end="02:09:24.140" style="s2">lungs or messing with the hemoglobin a</p>
<p begin="02:09:22.070" end="02:09:26.240" style="s2">bats gonna suffer from that very quickly</p>
<p begin="02:09:24.140" end="02:09:28.460" style="s2">because of the way in which oxygen is</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.240" end="02:09:31.700" style="s2">used so a sick bats not gonna last very</p>
<p begin="02:09:28.460" end="02:09:33.560" style="s2">long mm unless this thing is at a really</p>
<p begin="02:09:31.700" end="02:09:34.790" style="s2">really low level which is also possible</p>
<p begin="02:09:33.560" end="02:09:36.310" style="s2">or somehow it manifests quite</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.790" end="02:09:38.360" style="s2">differently in different hosts yep</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.310" end="02:09:41.300" style="s2">different host species like it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.360" end="02:09:44.300" style="s2">asymptomatic in bats right we die which</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.300" end="02:09:45.290" style="s2">is possible but I would also argue that</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.300" end="02:09:48.560" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna come with low</p>
<p begin="02:09:45.290" end="02:09:50.510" style="s2">transmissibility you know if the if the</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.560" end="02:09:51.680" style="s2">bat is biting yeah that the biting thing</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.510" end="02:09:53.630" style="s2">here horseshoe bats don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.680" end="02:09:55.340" style="s2">horseshoe bat biting a Pangolin would be</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.630" end="02:09:57.290" style="s2">quite a natural history scenario right</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.340" end="02:09:59.720" style="s2">on the other hand falling out of the sky</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.290" end="02:10:02.770" style="s2">because it&#39;s sick and couldn&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.720" end="02:10:04.970" style="s2">back and some animal trundling along and</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.770" end="02:10:06.770" style="s2">happening on to it is possible on the</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.970" end="02:10:12.590" style="s2">other handle don&#39;t they they do on the</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.770" end="02:10:15.080" style="s2">other hand the the wet market connection</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.590" end="02:10:16.880" style="s2">is looking very tenuous to me I did I</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.080" end="02:10:20.150" style="s2">started to do some looking into the</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.880" end="02:10:21.950" style="s2">distribution of bats around Wuhan I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.150" end="02:10:24.740" style="s2">having I&#39;m having trouble buying that</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.950" end="02:10:27.200" style="s2">this was the wet market I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.740" end="02:10:30.130" style="s2">much more likely the virology lab all</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.200" end="02:10:30.130" style="s2">right interesting</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.440" end="02:10:36.140" style="s2">please let us know buyed thank you by</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.270" end="02:10:38.480" style="s2">the way if you&#39;ll consider questions</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.140" end="02:10:41.469" style="s2">asked before left like next time okay</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.480" end="02:10:45.949" style="s2">so we&#39;ll try to figure that out sure</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.469" end="02:10:47.810" style="s2">okay yes we will also watch out for BOTS</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.949" end="02:10:51.830" style="s2">thank you I don&#39;t know how to pronounce</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.810" end="02:10:54.440" style="s2">your name uh Co for the Dorfman method</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.830" end="02:10:58.640" style="s2">is group testing combining samples to</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.440" end="02:11:01.190" style="s2">one repeat our PCP our test why isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.640" end="02:11:02.690" style="s2">used anywhere that gets us a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.190" end="02:11:05.270" style="s2">closer but I still don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.690" end="02:11:07.430" style="s2">what it&#39;s what it&#39;s referring to sorry</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.270" end="02:11:08.230" style="s2">thank you both for your work you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.430" end="02:11:12.170" style="s2">welcome</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.230" end="02:11:14.980" style="s2">possible evidence of tissue retreat okay</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.170" end="02:11:18.590" style="s2">so there&#39;s a link here we&#39;ll take a look</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.980" end="02:11:21.620" style="s2">three more questions can you guys give</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.590" end="02:11:24.830" style="s2">us a tour of your house video we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.620" end="02:11:26.449" style="s2">have a house and if we did it would be</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.830" end="02:11:27.680" style="s2">on VHS and you just like look at it</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.449" end="02:11:29.719" style="s2">there you go yeah</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.680" end="02:11:32.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.719" end="02:11:33.620" style="s2">frightening prospect but we&#39;ll think</p>
<p begin="02:11:32.180" end="02:11:37.460" style="s2">about yeah maybe we&#39;ll give you a tour</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.620" end="02:11:41.600" style="s2">of three corners three well-chosen</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.460" end="02:11:44.210" style="s2">corners of this confusing question for</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.600" end="02:11:47.660" style="s2">episode 4 could an organism carry a</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.210" end="02:11:49.610" style="s2">benign virus that kills predators any</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.660" end="02:11:53.900" style="s2">known examples presumably a virus would</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.610" end="02:11:57.080" style="s2">function like toxin yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.900" end="02:11:58.400" style="s2">yeah examples of that I will repeat what</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.080" end="02:12:00.020" style="s2">I said last time which is that the</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.400" end="02:12:02.600" style="s2">problem with this is an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.020" end="02:12:04.390" style="s2">mechanism is it the best deal if you had</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.600" end="02:12:07.340" style="s2">a virus the Predators</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.390" end="02:12:08.270" style="s2">feared irrationally let&#39;s say you would</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.340" end="02:12:10.040" style="s2">have to have some sort of an</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.270" end="02:12:11.600" style="s2">advertisement that you had the virus in</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.040" end="02:12:13.310" style="s2">order for predators to know to avoid you</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.600" end="02:12:15.590" style="s2">but then the best deal is to use the</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.310" end="02:12:18.650" style="s2">advertisement and not have the virus at</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.590" end="02:12:22.280" style="s2">all and so until you can get an honest</p>
<p begin="02:12:18.650" end="02:12:24.620" style="s2">advertisement of the virus I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.280" end="02:12:27.290" style="s2">how it could evolve yeah okay two more</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.620" end="02:12:29.120" style="s2">questions and then we are done do you</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.290" end="02:12:30.590" style="s2">believe that homo sapiens are the final</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.120" end="02:12:34.160" style="s2">carbon-based life-form in our</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.590" end="02:12:36.410" style="s2">evolutionary lineage well yes unless we</p>
<p begin="02:12:34.160" end="02:12:39.020" style="s2">figure some shit out pretty quickly here</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.410" end="02:12:41.630" style="s2">yeah and we could declare ourselves you</p>
<p begin="02:12:39.020" end="02:12:43.460" style="s2">know we could declare our children a new</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.630" end="02:12:46.580" style="s2">the the problem is</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.460" end="02:12:51.350" style="s2">the term species has these two different</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.580" end="02:12:53.570" style="s2">meanings right and so creatures in a</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.350" end="02:12:58.430" style="s2">sequence are different we can declare</p>
<p begin="02:12:53.570" end="02:13:00.320" style="s2">our kids a new species and because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.430" end="02:13:03.950" style="s2">not the same criteria you would use to</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.320" end="02:13:06.469" style="s2">separate to bat species let&#39;s say to Co</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.950" end="02:13:08.630" style="s2">coexisting bat species yeah but he says</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.469" end="02:13:10.400" style="s2">in our evolutionary lineage he makes a</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.630" end="02:13:13.510" style="s2">point of not saying species so you know</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.400" end="02:13:15.620" style="s2">we right that&#39;s my point is our lineage</p>
<p begin="02:13:13.510" end="02:13:18.170" style="s2">is continuing at least another</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.620" end="02:13:19.760" style="s2">generation yeah so I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.170" end="02:13:21.710" style="s2">answer the question okay one more</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.760" end="02:13:23.239" style="s2">question is it possible that the</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.710" end="02:13:25.550" style="s2">functionality of the memory cells is</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.239" end="02:13:28.070" style="s2">being hijacked by kovat and causing them</p>
<p begin="02:13:25.550" end="02:13:30.200" style="s2">to initiate hemolysis that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.070" end="02:13:32.420" style="s2">pronounced right hemolysis subsequently</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.200" end="02:13:34.430" style="s2">releasing ferritin and kicking off an</p>
<p begin="02:13:32.420" end="02:13:37.760" style="s2">aisle 6 cytokine storm</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.430" end="02:13:41.780" style="s2">well the cytokine storm has been</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.760" end="02:13:43.219" style="s2">observed as a I don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.780" end="02:13:46.850" style="s2">proper term would be but a major</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.219" end="02:13:52.910" style="s2">correlate of the worst cases of kovat 19</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.850" end="02:13:54.950" style="s2">yeah so I find it it&#39;s boy I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.910" end="02:13:56.270" style="s2">don&#39;t want to define it because I I will</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.950" end="02:13:57.380" style="s2">I will screw it up and then I will end</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.270" end="02:14:01.910" style="s2">up having to make another correction</p>
<p begin="02:13:57.380" end="02:14:04.160" style="s2">next time but so cytokine storm yes as</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.910" end="02:14:07.930" style="s2">for the several links in the chain you</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.160" end="02:14:11.530" style="s2">described don&#39;t know enough to say I</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.930" end="02:14:15.890" style="s2">will say that there are two</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.530" end="02:14:19.510" style="s2">possibilities what was I reading it had</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.890" end="02:14:22.910" style="s2">to do with whether or not Cova dean was</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.510" end="02:14:24.440" style="s2">attacking the immune system which would</p>
<p begin="02:14:22.910" end="02:14:27.560" style="s2">be a very frightening prospect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.440" end="02:14:30.950" style="s2">what aids does is AIDS or HIV attacks</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.560" end="02:14:37.040" style="s2">the activated t-cells and then the</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.950" end="02:14:39.530" style="s2">alternative possibility was don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.040" end="02:14:41.500" style="s2">it I don&#39;t have it but it looked like it</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.530" end="02:14:43.850" style="s2">was not attacking the immune cells</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.500" end="02:14:47.239" style="s2">specifically so you know who knows that</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.850" end="02:14:48.590" style="s2">evidence will develop again I&#39;ve now got</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.239" end="02:14:50.030" style="s2">a bunch of things I need to look into</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.590" end="02:14:54.200" style="s2">but I will see if I can&#39;t come up with</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.030" end="02:14:56.060" style="s2">the particular paper I was looking at</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.200" end="02:14:57.890" style="s2">and pass it along next time</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.060" end="02:15:00.170" style="s2">okay one more question and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.890" end="02:15:01.880" style="s2">out all right has any of you have any of</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.170" end="02:15:03.590" style="s2">you spoken with Paul Stamets could</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.880" end="02:15:06.650" style="s2">mushrooms play a role in resolving Coppa</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.590" end="02:15:08.690" style="s2">19 no one by reputation but not the man</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.650" end="02:15:09.800" style="s2">yeah um don&#39;t know if he&#39;s working on</p>
<p begin="02:15:08.690" end="02:15:12.140" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.800" end="02:15:14.450" style="s2">a fellow greener though he&#39;s a he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.140" end="02:15:17.090" style="s2">fellow greater fellow greener so anyway</p>
<p begin="02:15:14.450" end="02:15:19.340" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know he seems to find</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.090" end="02:15:21.950" style="s2">mushrooms have utility and lots of</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.340" end="02:15:24.170" style="s2">things so are we always shocked but</p>
<p begin="02:15:21.950" end="02:15:26.630" style="s2">anyway Paul if you got something and</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.170" end="02:15:28.460" style="s2">contact us that&#39;s right all right</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.630" end="02:15:30.440" style="s2">all right well this has been harrowing</p>
