<p begin="00:00:03.040" end="00:00:05.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.359" end="00:00:09.359" style="s2">the first retina discussion</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:13.280" style="s2">how shall we proceed does anyone have</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.840" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">any particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.280" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">notes to start out with</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:22.480" style="s2">so we are discussing the first video</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.240" end="00:00:25.519" style="s2">that you reckon yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.480" end="00:00:27.920" style="s2">we are discussing the first conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.519" end="00:00:32.800" style="s2">that john had with</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.920" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">um jordan hall on the design constraints</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.800" end="00:00:36.640" style="s2">for the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.440" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">are you recording now yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">no one has any particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">thingies so</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">one thing that sort of jumped out at me</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:19.119" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.520" style="s2">because because i haven&#39;t been doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.119" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">this in my head at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.520" end="00:01:27.439" style="s2">is that john thinks</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.600" style="s2">that we should work out the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.439" end="00:01:33.360" style="s2">functionality of religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.600" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">in the first place like get a really</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.360" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">full understanding of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">spirituality and how it works</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">and then reverse engineer that</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">back into um</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">yeah like the root now and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">i guess on the chat the text channel so</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">far we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">sort of discussed the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">religion too much</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">so far like we obviously we do because</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">it feels like maybe we should put more</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">well i i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">it sounds almost to me like this the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">issue is very similar but</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">or the issues are very similar but</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">they&#39;re actually two different</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">um because the definition and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">function isn&#39;t necessarily the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">and so i guess the question then is i</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">don&#39;t remember actually in the video i</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">remember the function stuff i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">remember the definition stuff so i guess</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">i didn&#39;t mean to say definition i just</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.200" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">meant i may have misspoke</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">no no it&#39;s shivarani who&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:01.840" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve got to say okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.720" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">are we trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:10.560" style="s2">and then we can create it right but i</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">think that has</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.560" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">like um there&#39;s two particular ways of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">talking about the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:19.599" style="s2">like on the one hand um</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">we already have the answer in that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.599" end="00:03:22.800" style="s2">are looking for a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">religion but we don&#39;t have the answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.800" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">which religion that&#39;s not a religion we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">need so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you are talking trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">to speak about the more broad one or the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">more narrow one</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">in that case</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">like i mean i presume that you agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">we need a religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">are you talking to chef around either</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.840" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">sorry yeah i think i i think by</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">definition we all agree that we need a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">yeah so then the i think that like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">the problem then is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">is creating the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:17.199" style="s2">religion and then from there</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">the functionality question is the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.199" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">one that arises because we ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">well what exactly is it that religions</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">do right</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">well look what what i heard and maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">misheard but what i heard was what</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:36.560" style="s2">are you trying to solve with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">religion that is not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.560" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">and so defining those problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.199" style="s2">specifically would</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">be the first step and then it sounded to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.199" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">me like</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">again from what i heard the second step</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">is figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">how those problems are currently or</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">should be currently addressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:57.440" style="s2">uh with with existing religions</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">and then the third step from what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.440" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">heard was to reverse</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">engineer that right and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">you can have the basis for doing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">and the the the the problem that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">hearing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">okay so that and just to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">because i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.280" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not trying to hide anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:19.840" style="s2">but what i keep hearing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.280" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">is yeah that&#39;s not a religion so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">just design it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">but we&#39;re not taking those first three</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:27.280" style="s2">steps and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">that focusing on on maybe at least one</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.280" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">of those steps and you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">have to do them</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">uh in order to get the definitions down</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">but probably in order is better right</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">would be would be helpful so for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">you could go through all the things you</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">think religions do</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">and not worry about targeting it towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">you know some specific</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">aspect that you may may not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">define in terms of problem to fix</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">prior so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">pick one and let&#39;s work on that first</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">and see how far we can get what notes we</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">can take etc</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">and how does that sound agreed</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">and that sort of uh made me think</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">because later on john says that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">is a fair point like we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">formulate the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">really really well before we can start</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">to solve</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">things and it occurs to me that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">understanding the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:32.639" style="s2">religion and formulating the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">are basically the same thing because if</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.639" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">religion and now we&#39;re in a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:40.560" style="s2">the problem is that we&#39;ve lost the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">functionality of religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.560" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.479" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">yeah i think i can agree with that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">it was well i mean one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">that i also wrote down is the importance</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:56.800" style="s2">uh nietzsche was pronouncing the death</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">of god</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">but he was doing so while he fully</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">understood what we were losing in terms</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">of the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">to your point</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">all right so um could we say that to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.919" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">degree that we&#39;re all gathered here</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">together with each other that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">hoping collectively to produce</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">something of value with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">understanding this process</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">and then could we not say that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">which feeds into</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">that product this very process itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">should kind of exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">those elements of collective wisdom that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">if not tangential directly</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">representative of the religion it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:42.240" style="s2">a religion so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">is there a manner in which we could be</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.240" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">now in each other&#39;s presence</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">as we set an intention and as we develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">this stuff in real time</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">that is uh at the same time that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">constructing it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">or representing it right is there</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">true to that process which is part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:04.319" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to build</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">and that we can notice uh as a part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.319" end="00:08:07.280" style="s2">the design criteria</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">i feel like we consistently</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.120" end="00:08:18.960" style="s2">engage in you know dialogue us</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">like a lot so i think we all we</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.960" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">we just do that anyway</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">but that reminds me what me and mark</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">was saying yesterday well it&#39;s what mark</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">brought up um</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">a lot of us on the written our committee</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t don&#39;t seem to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">the like community practice on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">discord</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">like almost at all like there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">no overlap between written our committee</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">and the people who are regularly doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">so like that i feel like that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.080" style="s2">to the idea of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">exemplifying what we&#39;re going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.080" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">do in the end while we do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">especially as they&#39;ll probably make us</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">give wiser answers to the problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">yes um we probably should be doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.120" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">um sometimes i do and sometimes i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m bad at consistent</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">well nothing wrong with partaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">what not but question in there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">which of the events particularly geared</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">towards narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.839" end="00:09:51.920" style="s2">we have an ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">springing from primarily the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.920" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">right and and we&#39;ve been uh trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">implement those</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">as best as we can and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:02.720" style="s2">modifying them right and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">document all that at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.720" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">haven&#39;t been doing a good job of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">but we we have some it&#39;s not like we</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">haven&#39;t done any</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">and participation in at least the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.200" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">john&#39;s talking about in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">ecologies is useful</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">participating on the discord server is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">as useful if not more useful because</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">some of our practices vary</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">right because they&#39;re more around</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">communities because that&#39;s more what</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to build here</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.240" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know why we would limit it to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">narratives since we don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.240" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">does and doesn&#39;t work and we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">schematized the ecology of practices yet</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:36.640" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">i&#39;m looking forward to talking to john</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.640" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">about that in the next couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">and then i&#39;m i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">how relevant that is to problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">definition for example so while i think</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">this is a good effort and yeah we did</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">talk about it last night and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely uh something to put on</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">the list</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">i think that we can actually make</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">progress with the definition</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">if we focus on the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">problem we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">and just get step one sort of at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">on the tracks</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">if not uh if if not far enough down the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">track to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">to be useful</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:17.040" style="s2">and i will add uh one of the notes i</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.360" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">made which i already believed i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.040" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve said it already</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:24.720" style="s2">i think trying to do narrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">right now is a bit you know ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.720" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">feels like it should probably emerge out</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">like an established set of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">and stuff like that like that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:38.399" style="s2">should come first and it feels like we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.399" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">gotten anywhere near that yet no but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">my whole uh perspective on this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">narrative is the functionality that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">affords people so</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">uh you know yeah we well um</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">you might say that we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">ahead of us ourselves by dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">narrative but i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">that actually narrative is what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">should be looking at first of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.200" style="s2">when we&#39;re trying to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">functionality of religion</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.200" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i i think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.240" end="00:12:13.040" style="s2">subtle that goes on during the practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">of education</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.040" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">where you you construct your own inner</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">narrative regardless of what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">spoken about culturally at the meta</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">layer</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">and i think if we have an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">practices and if we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">sets of information which are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.360" style="s2">to explain</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">a lot of these deeply important aspects</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.360" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">of life and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.560" end="00:12:40.160" style="s2">and communitas and all of that then</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">if you let people look out in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">at the the sum total of all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">they&#39;ll see the common threads</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">from that perhaps construct something</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">which is convergent enough with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">people who have gone through that same</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">such that they can use a common language</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">but not require</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">that everyone have precisely the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">words or precisely the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">narrative right it&#39;s just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">mapping onto</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">a common experience to a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">level right</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like it feels like like</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">yes we need narrative like we do yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">that needs content like it&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">to refer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">and if we&#39;re looking at narrative in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">terms of defining functionality</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">and um looking at then we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:29.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">other religions narratives we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.680" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">figuring out our own we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">figure out okay how does this religion&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">narrative work how does this religion&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">narrative work</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">okay what&#39;s the commonalities what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">right i agree but the only way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be able to do that is by</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">in some sense practicing the narrative i</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">no that&#39;s not practice that&#39;s um looking</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.760" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">at this and examining it unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">talking about practicing the narratives</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">of other religions</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:13:59.920" style="s2">because at this point we&#39;re not create</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">you&#39;re not creating your own you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.920" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">saying i need to better understand the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">i need to better understand what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">on already okay how do other narratives</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">work how do other religions work</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">okay now that we&#39;ve got the problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">what divided into sections okay now</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve got sections let&#39;s work on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">section</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re still at the process we</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">started exploring the narratives of any</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">religions yet and we need to do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">that&#39;s i think what my position well i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:35.920" style="s2">definitely on board with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">i just feel like um like we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">sort out if you want to know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">like pretty much everything else first</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:48.079" style="s2">and then the narrative will grow out and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">bind everything</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.079" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">all together in the end it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:56.839" style="s2">rather than the narrative coming first</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">and then everything coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.839" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">well given that we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">look into all these things anyway i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">say if strewn wants to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">examine narrative and start looking into</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:11.120" style="s2">that in depth then that makes sense and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">he can do that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.120" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">get back to us and let us know what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.680" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">yeah yeah well i mean the the comments</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.680" end="00:15:20.800" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">ritmail section about heroism and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.800" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">is basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">where i am on that front so i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">i&#39;m happy to share with with what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">discovered um</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know if that really counts</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">as a practice or some something that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">retinal community is doing as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:44.079" style="s2">collective or like a communal project</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">so then well um you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.079" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">i would be doing that on my own but then</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">what would the rest of you be doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">yeah well from my understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.079" style="s2">what we&#39;d want to do is we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">um different sections what are different</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.079" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">groups of us working on different things</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">um and if um if exploring narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">something you&#39;re really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">then it makes sense for you to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">heading up that section</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">and then um we want other people looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">other aspects of the problem right</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">yeah fair enough i suppose if we can so</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">long as we can get everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">working together in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.480" style="s2">reasonable fashion</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">think of it as a really big group</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.480" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">project and we&#39;re having to divide into</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:30.000" style="s2">subgroups</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea but we should all</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.000" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">definitely keep our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">fingers in every domain and not just</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">split up and then just come back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">pretty much dictate to each other what</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">we found in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">different areas because only we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">familiar with our area or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">just sort of specialize rather than like</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">completely go in on one thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">yeah so maybe um well we&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">weekly meetings maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.600" style="s2">have like okay this is what i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">try and get done this week this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.600" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">i&#39;m going to try and get done this week</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">and then we get when we meet up we say</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">okay what have you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">figured out okay what have you figured</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">out and then discuss the different</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">um parts that get brought up</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.199" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">yeah so certainly a standard project</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:33.200" style="s2">management practice is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">report on what you got done last week in</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.200" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">your section</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">right and then you know to your point</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:39.679" style="s2">report on what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">moving forward with and just to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.679" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">everybody up to date</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">in a quick you know i mean if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">doing software it would be called agile</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s perfectly perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">reasonable to do it weekly</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">um if it&#39;s quick then</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">everybody can stay up to date and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">as long as we&#39;re tracking things in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">appropriate channels or whatever then</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">people have text to refer to and we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">come up with outlines or reports or</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">you know whatever we need to circulate</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">for more detail for those who are</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.840" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">okay so what other subsections do we</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">need right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.600" style="s2">so strewn was mentioning he um</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">he&#39;s interested in looking into</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.600" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.559" style="s2">looking at the narrative of religion</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">what other things do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.559" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">prioritize looking at right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:40.160" style="s2">well there&#39;s the obvious ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">practices and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.160" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">kind of because i i i&#39;m under the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">impression that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">mark and ben and others</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">i assume are really really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">going in on trying to make a little</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">prototype of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">our ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">define the problem first though like</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">this the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">um we could be exploring um different</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">practices and figuring out okay this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:11.360" style="s2">useful for this this is useful for this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">but until we know okay so the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.360" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">x</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t know okay will the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">a help with x and so you can do all</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:20.960" style="s2">kinds of research on ecology a but if</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:22.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to help with x</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.960" end="00:19:24.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.480" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">yeah so if you if you want to do a uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">targeted approach</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">then the problem definition has to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:35.520" style="s2">before any of the other work</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">and again i&#39;m you know not opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.520" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">doing that or</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">the alternative is you know go after the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">big three</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">all at the same time in parallel right</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:47.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s problem definition</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.480" style="s2">uh you know what what we&#39;re expecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.480" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">uh written r to to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">what we can steal from existing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:59.440" style="s2">religious practices</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">at the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot harder</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.440" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">to steal from the religious practices at</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.120" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">least in theory if you have to go after</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">after everything before the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:07.440" style="s2">definition is done but i i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have to do that anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:14.559" style="s2">yeah we still need the problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:17.039" style="s2">definition either way i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.559" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">that has to be high on the list yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">higher priority but</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">definitely by looking at practices it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">will give us</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:30.159" style="s2">pointers about what problems to solve</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">yeah well we&#39;re not we&#39;re not if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">big problem right that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">um that part of the problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">existing religions aren&#39;t working okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">so why are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">existing religions working what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:43.200" style="s2">existing religions giving and what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:45.679" style="s2">they lacking</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.200" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ve got that sorted out</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.679" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">what is the um what is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">problems that people are having in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">everyday life are that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">meaning problems with meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">everyday life with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">work-life balance or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">what of what else is causing a problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">what else is related to the problem what</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">else is part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">this comes back to some notes i made on</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:13.840" style="s2">the video</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">so partly because of strewn</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.360" end="00:21:27.280" style="s2">basically i think we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">um have a very general overview of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.280" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">as we&#39;ve basically totalized</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:37.520" style="s2">truth and we&#39;ve lost relevance</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">and it seems to me that you call it that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">all the practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">in they pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:51.200" style="s2">are for calibrating your relevance</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">systems as opposed to your truth systems</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.200" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">and then a kind of sub problem is of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">is that even when people</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">do kind of recognize the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.760" end="00:22:02.880" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;s usually then at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.880" end="00:22:08.640" style="s2">truth so you&#39;ve got the opposite problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">and they&#39;re not integrated properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.640" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">so i can&#39;t exactly remember where i was</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">going with that but there you are</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">well i think there&#39;s quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">truth in that actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you john just released</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">another video</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">um he was talking about well he was he</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:41.120" style="s2">was doing a video on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">the people who do the mars rover work</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.120" end="00:22:44.159" style="s2">but he was really really in depth with</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">respect to the perspective on knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.159" end="00:22:47.520" style="s2">and the predatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">that kind of thing and he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">starting to make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">or at least in that video he made the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">distinction between reality and realness</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">where reality was you know some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">ontological state but the realness was</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">was the feeling of something being</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">worthwhile that</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">and so yeah i think that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">good direction to be going down</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">and i think we can see john is also</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">starting to go down</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.520" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">so did anyone have any particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.039" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">comments about the iron age hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:39.200" style="s2">in the video</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">don&#39;t think i had anything deep on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">pretty much just i agree that we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:52.840" style="s2">probably avoid</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">them and that they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.840" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">responsible</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">partly for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">descent into just dead propositions</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">i&#39;d argue for not a hierarchy as such</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">but um uh some people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">better at teaching some things and some</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">better people are better at doing other</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">and so then you&#39;ll kind of have uh all</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:24.640" style="s2">um this person&#39;s really good at yoga and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">this person&#39;s really good at tai chi so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.640" end="00:24:28.000" style="s2">if i want to learn tai chi i&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">this person if i want to learn yoga i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.000" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">go to this person</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">so not so much a hierarchy as such as uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">um different people for different tasks</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">i guess we want to avoid the triangular</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:45.760" style="s2">hierarchy where it&#39;s all just</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:47.520" style="s2">goes up to some pinnacle at the top</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.760" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">where there&#39;s one or very small number</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.520" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">just sort of in command of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">but we don&#39;t want to just demolish all</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">authority of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:03.840" style="s2">so we sort of want</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">a landscape with bumps that rise up out</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.840" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">basically so that each bump isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">necessarily you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">controlled by some supreme pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.080" style="s2">you are not the best but you&#39;re better</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">at this than me so i&#39;ll i can learn from</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.080" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">what did you think stroke um</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated on the one hand yes but</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">like the state is an authority</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">where it has a monopoly on violence and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">at the end of the day the disagree like</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">violence is the ultimate decider in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.520" style="s2">if you&#39;re willing to get violent then</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to win out of the person</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.520" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">that isn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">and i think like on the one hand yes we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want an iron age hierarchy where</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">everything goes narrow to the top but on</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">you have to have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">centralizing feature that at least can a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">that is able to constrain</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">you know human behavior such as violent</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">behavior to a reasonable degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:19.600" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have that then</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">you&#39;re just going to have an anarchy so</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.600" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">we we can&#39;t just do away with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">hierarchy completely but</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">we need to figure out a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">reconceptualizing it so that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">repeat the the worst uh</p>

<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t community expectation of um</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">of non-violence be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">uh no because you already have laws</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">against murder</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">but people still do it anyway and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">when it happens you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">actually have somebody to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">the the the consequences in the fallout</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">and that invariably involves something</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">like a justice</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">and so that entire system has to work</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">so we&#39;re not we&#39;re not recreating</p>

<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.440" style="s2">those are in place in lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:17.520" style="s2">countries we&#39;re not creating a new</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:31.440" style="s2">no but well i i frankly i disagree</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.440" end="00:27:36.159" style="s2">the entire the fact that the two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">model is collapsing and we can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.159" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">believe in our religions</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">is also undermining the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">which we use to justify these various</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">legal systems the one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">to lose credibility in the one is</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">ultimately to see the other one as like</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">arbitrary contrivance it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">sense and that causes</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">if if you can&#39;t ground those systems</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">in such a way that the person can</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">actually integrate with those systems in</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">terms of their world view</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">then there will be a clash and the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">people will fundamentally start to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">undermine</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">or subvert the the authorities and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">will lead ultimately to a societal</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">and so from my perspective ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">what you need rick lars to do is to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">able to be robust enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">to to actually sustain something like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:23.840" style="s2">legal system</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:25.760" style="s2">because if it doesn&#39;t do that then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">not it fundamentally won&#39;t be viable in</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.760" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">so you&#39;re figuring society is going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">collapse so we want to build something</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">that can take its place</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">um well i i wouldn&#39;t want to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">to collapse but there are several</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">indicators that suggest that that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">likely let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">well i i think that you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">another possibility here and that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">all we need written are to do is to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:57.600" style="s2">able to revivify</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">the justice system or something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.600" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">that right revivify the ability</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">of governmental authority</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">to to work the way it has</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:12.799" style="s2">my point basically is that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">uh the existing authority structures are</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.799" end="00:29:15.360" style="s2">still premised upon the iron age</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">hierarchies right</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.360" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">so retina insofar as it creates a new</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.440" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">non-iron age hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">will necessarily have to or necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:25.919" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">create the the necessary grammar or</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.919" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">whatever to actually start</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">uh reviving or revivifying the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">legal systems and the other normative</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">okay but but yeah as opposed to what i</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">heard you say earlier</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a much more reasonable statement</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:44.480" style="s2">which is in line with what i thought i</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">was trying to say which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.480" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to worry about those</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">problems necessarily they will take care</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">of themselves if we do a good job with</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">retina</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">because it will be able to revivify the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">other hierarchical structures uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:29:59.440" style="s2">assuming that such a thing is possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:01.679" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.440" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">you know whatever i have philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.679" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">doubts about that but</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re trying to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">scope is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">yeah and what i&#39;m trying to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to have a written order</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">that succeeds it will have to address</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">the iron age hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">and insofar as it does it will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:21.279" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">in being able to revive the</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.279" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">the at the higher the old hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s another problem that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">have to work on then so we should put</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">that on the problem list</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">right this hierarchy problem i guess</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">we&#39;ll call it for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">that we can come up with yeah well i</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:39.200" style="s2">think the uh in the the video that um</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">that we were supposed to watch like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.200" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">the comments that jordan made i think is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">very useful because he ties together the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:47.360" style="s2">way that jonathan pejora speaks about</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">narrative and iron age hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.360" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">two worlds model and how</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">those have all traditionally been used</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">to tie the whole thing together</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">that that&#39;s why i come at least from</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">having watched the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">video why i think that the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">piece of the puzzle is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">something to import to bring up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">respect to retinol</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.559" style="s2">nobody&#39;s denying that though i think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.240" style="s2">problem is we think that narrative is</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:11.919" style="s2">four or five steps out</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.240" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t want to try to go four</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.919" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">or five steps out before we do the work</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">defining problems and coming and looking</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:22.080" style="s2">at existing solutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">etc so i i i don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.080" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">on about this narrative thing that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">and and you&#39;ve been given that task so</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">that&#39;ll get solved and nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">because nobody&#39;s having this what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">saying is the iron age hierarchy problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">comes behind the narrative problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a one in the same thing yes what</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">he&#39;s saying is the scope is larger than</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">previously thought yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">so can we do this from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">what is the foundation of biological</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.919" style="s2">life for humans</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">you know like can we can we look at it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.919" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">just from the the pure perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">what it is to come into this world</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">and the environment that one inhabits as</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">a child it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">i&#39;m not like jean piaget was</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">at exactly the same task that we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:15.519" style="s2">of doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">and you know his work is probably</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">there&#39;s something to the notion that you</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:30.159" style="s2">we&#39;re granted these highly complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">mythopoetic narratives and long before</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.159" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">we even know real spoken language we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">emotionally which has a profound and</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">sometimes very dramatic impact</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">on the way in which we develop our</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:53.360" style="s2">the right relation of the environment</p>

<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">would have a profound impact on what it</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">order and structure that thing which is</p>

<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">to find again in the religion that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">a religion</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.120" style="s2">right whatever it is that brings us in</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">the right relationship with each other</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">often defined as each other is that fair</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">to say that this is probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.440" style="s2">a pretty significant design constraint</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">like if the structure of the family were</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.440" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">to change</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.880" style="s2">or if the nature of how life is reared</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">changed or</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.880" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">um you know like some of these really</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:38.399" style="s2">profound structural</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">geometrical changes in our culture that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.399" end="00:33:41.600" style="s2">that would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">a pretty significant constraint on what</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.600" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">it is to consider a religion</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">am i hearing a project in there to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.760" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">figure out the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:55.600" style="s2">family structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">and religions because that&#39;s that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.600" end="00:34:01.600" style="s2">of how i translated that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">yeah that could be like i said i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.600" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">yeah jean piaget&#39;s work is probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">relevant there</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">that that&#39;s fine i it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">project item on the list so</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">who&#39;s going to take that and run with it</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">right that&#39;s the question there</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">for the current analysis of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">to construct the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">right that would be a framework by which</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.399" style="s2">one starts to even look for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">salient information relevant information</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">i feel like we&#39;ve just got this we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.800" end="00:34:39.359" style="s2">got an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.040" style="s2">uh domain to consider which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.359" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">like i&#39;m basically condensing what i</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.040" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">think strewn was getting at</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">overall which is while</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:50.720" style="s2">we can talk about um you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:53.280" style="s2">want iron age hierarchies we do we we</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.720" end="00:34:57.520" style="s2">have to think seriously about</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.280" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">hierarchies in general family seems like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">one example of a hierarchy that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">you know reorder</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">um and then obviously there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s another hierarchy hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">thing to consider</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:18.000" style="s2">so i guess we could start putting a list</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">of hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.000" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">topics to consider</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s not a bad suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.320" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">all right so so far we&#39;ve got um</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.800" end="00:35:36.560" style="s2">narratives of other religions</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:39.359" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.560" end="00:35:42.839" style="s2">what else needs um researching to help</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.359" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">define the problem and the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">oh yeah and we&#39;ve got trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">back the training of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">and not totalizing truth i guess</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">is that part of the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">problem but</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">yeah i mean i i think the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">issue we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">that sort of causes all the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">is that we&#39;ve totalized truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">and just forgotten relevance like we</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s the but but i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">almost sounds like a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:20.800" style="s2">talking about the iron age hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">well yeah i think it&#39;s that that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.800" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">definitely part of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">yeah like that those two are so like</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually hard to tell them apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">is it maybe maybe not let&#39;s do some</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">research and figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">instead of just assuming that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">that tied together because i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">so but</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">you know until we have somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">researching it we won&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">well i mean i&#39;ve taken a reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.440" style="s2">deep look at that kind of thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">a conclusion i came to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.440" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">um i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:37:01.119" style="s2">the main motivation for me suggesting to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">john that the there&#39;s a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.119" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">intelligibility and agape let&#39;s say is</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">because i was trying to create a</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">truth and goodness in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:14.720" style="s2">hierarchical demands</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s long been a bugbear of mine</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">with the way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">john speaks about realism although</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">i have to say i&#39;m very happy with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">way that he has actually changed the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">that he uses that term so that uh all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:30.079" style="s2">these particular actually even sent me</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">an email today to that effect saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.079" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s really nice to see the way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">he&#39;s making the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">reality and realness</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">yeah sorry i forgot where i was going</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.000" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">well look ron if you if you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">something worked out i&#39;d love to see a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">white paper on it</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">but unless we have research that we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">look at that&#39;s written down that we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">read and agree on</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">in terms of terminology and conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">we still have zero right like we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">chat about things in voice and record it</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">all day long but if we can&#39;t put things</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">on paper that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">we can agree on then we can&#39;t build a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">thing and it doesn&#39;t matter what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">thing is in this case it&#39;s written are</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">that&#39;s how you build things that network</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.480" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">is by getting agreement</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">because things are written down and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">people can you know really wrestle with</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">and agree to them and if you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">conclusions that sound hokey to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">but are are well thought out then you</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">know and you don&#39;t need to research them</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">hey write them down and then we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">if we&#39;ll see if they fit and if they fit</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">that&#39;s great otherwise we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">actually making progress we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">arguments over whether or not something</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">that somebody said may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">right which is not going to get us</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">anywhere ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">yeah well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">well if you actually want the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">specifics and just look at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">alexander bard conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">the conversation that john had because</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:10.720" style="s2">bob went into all of the details with</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:13.520" style="s2">respect to zoroastrianism</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.720" end="00:39:15.440" style="s2">and how that helped to shape western</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.520" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.440" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">and the point is there that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:21.119" style="s2">zoroastrianism or</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">that was what created the distinction it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.119" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">was one of the first actual age</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">religions in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">it crafted a world view where the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">was literally separated</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:31.119" style="s2">into the true world and the falsehood</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">and that was one of the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.119" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">the truth was created as a totalizing</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:36.560" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">and so order was seen as truth and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">was seen as false</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">and that was that gave the bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">what was static and eternal as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">to what was dynamic and material let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:46.240" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:52.320" style="s2">and so that like the entire iron age if</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">it if it is what came out of after the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">bronze age collapse</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">is fundamentally how that zoroastrian</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">grammar that the two-world mythology</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">moved from a from a two-world chaos</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">order kind of paradigm to a two-world</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">reality slash illusion paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">and so that that that&#39;s where my</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">argument with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">totalization of truth would come in</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">because you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">you can literally go up and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">the um</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">the meaning of the word uh usher and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">logos and and arthur and how they</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">connect and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">um they all basically in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">a very deep sense come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">notion of truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t disagree i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.119" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">watch the video</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:33.839" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know what else to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">other than what i said which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.839" end="00:40:37.200" style="s2">unless and until we have a paper that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:39.200" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">look at all read and agree on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.200" end="00:40:43.680" style="s2">conclusions of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure we have much okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.680" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">great i can&#39;t write the paper now so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.839" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">so this is a significant one</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">the tyre noted</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">which is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">definitely make a list</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">of the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">like that&#39;s literally problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">formulation</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">and that will definitely help with our</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">ecology of practices because like we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:50.960" style="s2">literally just</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">pick them out in order to direct them</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.960" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">towards the solving of perennial</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">and i literally have no idea what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.280" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">perennial problems are</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard the term enough times but</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve never actually remembered</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">what they are well i think that an</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">example would be like horror</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">when you are when your life is overcome</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">by horror because</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:15.920" style="s2">all of the the things that you thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">made sense no longer make sense anymore</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.920" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know where you are</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">like that&#39;s a perennial problem because</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s something that everybody can face</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">during the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing there&#39;s nothing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.240" style="s2">can do to get rid of the perennialness</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.240" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">and so there&#39;s things like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">self-deception um</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">foolishness in general um</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">now i suppose you know but i mean it can</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:40.720" style="s2">be it can also be things like grief you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:42.240" style="s2">know because</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.720" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">uh having to deal with death is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.240" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a good point we can have some kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">of macro and micro perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.680" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">right and and i i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">from a therapeutic perspective you would</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.440" style="s2">want like a sweeter response</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">and and a way of figuring out how to tie</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.319" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">those responses together</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">so that you could actually give</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe you don&#39;t but at</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">least in theory you could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">have a one-size-fits-all kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:18.160" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to go down</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.160" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">that route</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">guess we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">yeah you certainly need to do a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">research on</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">perennial problems that&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure they&#39;re going to map it all</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:34.880" style="s2">to the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">just based on what i understand of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.880" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">but you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:41.119" style="s2">we have to list them to find out right</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll again</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.119" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">we still have to schematize the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually going to get work</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">done soon so</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">um yeah the if if the perennial solving</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">the perennial problems is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">part of the definition of written r and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">probably as close to an axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">statement as we can make at this point</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">um then that should be pretty high on</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:07.280" style="s2">the list of things to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:08.960" style="s2">at least a handle on if if we can&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.280" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">it out i think that john has actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.960" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">commented on this before that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">nobody actually has a complete list to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">some extent</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">and i don&#39;t remember the context or or</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">you know if i&#39;m remembering accurately</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:22.720" style="s2">at all but</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.720" style="s2">yeah it would be helpful to at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.720" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">have an idea of what all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.720" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">all the possible levels of perennial</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">problem are</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">and and get some kind of handle on</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">what might be able to to fix that within</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">uh that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">that can be done within the religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">i&#39;ve just i&#39;ve just considered</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">so strewn mentioned that obviously one</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.839" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">perennial problems is death but</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">it feels like there&#39;s a genre</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">of thing we have to address that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">exactly a problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">like birth like we celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">births and it feels like that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">like we need to include something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:16.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t feel like that&#39;s solving</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:24.240" style="s2">a problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">exactly and yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.240" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">so that there&#39;s sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s on the same level as problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">that we need to kind of formulate</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:39.119" style="s2">that we might address say goodness</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">i mean well i mean you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.319" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">birth</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">and you know when you when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">the bronze age religions</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">they were all about fertility and birth</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">and creation</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:56.560" style="s2">like the the partaking in the generative</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">aspect of life was to partake in</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.560" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">literally and so you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">the the the bronze age festivals and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:07.200" style="s2">rituals and everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">were all around maximizing fertility</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.200" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">wonder all of them but like a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">portion of them at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.599" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.800" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">getting at a problem per se</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">i mean it can be framed as a problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">right so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">the well i would say not having the</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">thing could be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.960" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">yes as i was saying you can reformula</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.000" end="00:46:34.160" style="s2">reformulate it as a problem right but</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s the something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.160" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">all of the we need to come up with a set</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">of all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">that are that positively</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.200" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">not not just people and not just healthy</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">families for example to tyler&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">but but also healthy</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">cultures and healthy societies if we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">make a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">distinction there and perhaps we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">make more distinctions but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">i think that would be a good list to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">have too right so you have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">generative things and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">list of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">uh blocker things in essence which are</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">right and then you you you need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">define some progression</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.440" style="s2">right and then because as you go through</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">life right obviously as you get towards</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.440" end="00:47:24.800" style="s2">the end of your life you worry about</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">your own death not just everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.800" end="00:47:29.200" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s worthy of having some</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">research done on it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">uh and that would tie nicely into what</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">tyler was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:48.319" style="s2">okay so i dropped out for a bit there um</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">so strong&#39;s looking into the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">of other religions</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">um what other um subsections do we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">and do we have anyone who&#39;s decided they</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">want to work on them</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">well we just we just discussed um</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">perennial problems and then a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.960" end="00:48:11.280" style="s2">positive version like</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember what don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.280" end="00:48:16.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to call it yet but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:18.839" style="s2">i i&#39;m quite interested in looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:20.800" style="s2">perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.839" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.800" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">i&#39;ll probably take that up</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.480" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">so what are we calling it then</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.760" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">protective factors or something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">things that help prevent the problems or</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:42.079" style="s2">mitigate the problems</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">mitigating factors alleviation</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.079" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">well we want the list first we want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">define</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">the perennial problems perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:52.319" style="s2">formulation</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">before we can think about the you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.319" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">solutions but i</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:48:59.200" style="s2">i think the ecology of practices is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.200" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">the main solution to perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.119" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">yeah and to your point we need a name</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">for the things that are generative</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">you know of society i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">they&#39;re positively generative of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">culture or something like that right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s bigger than just culture obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">societies and cultures protective</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.839" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">influences</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know just a degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">one right things like birth and</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">fertility and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">you know uh you know raised positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">raising of children</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">right positive development of families</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.440" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">to tyler&#39;s point about relationships</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:45.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">positive relationships at the family</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.520" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">level which engender positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:51.359" style="s2">relationships at the community level</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.880" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">etc all the way up to as far as you need</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.359" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">so those are the things that are stopped</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">by the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">right so you need to know what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">things are that are generating the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.000" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">society and the culture and etc</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">and and you need the list of perennial</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">problems that are preventing those from</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">either unfolding at all or unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">healthily or both</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:13.599" style="s2">something like that so those are two</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">different projects that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.599" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">sort of interrelate and you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">tyler&#39;s stuff folds in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">right there or something around you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">how relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">and all that it sounds uh very similar</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">but yeah if you don&#39;t engender not only</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:31.680" style="s2">a way to to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">fertile but to but to a positive way to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.680" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">be fertile but</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:39.520" style="s2">but also to to have good parenting</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">uh uh skills or whatever that that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">positively generative</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">right and regenerative then yeah you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">definitely got a a problem that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">perennial problem but created by your</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">by your system sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">so i&#39;ve note i&#39;ve noticed that another</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">one of my notes</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">kind of is some</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.559" end="00:51:09.599" style="s2">problem formulation that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">john mentioned which is his way of</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.599" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">explaining it was religions tend to fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">into semantic complexity</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">and the equivocation that results from</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">that causes a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">so that seems to raise</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">the necessity for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">a nice clean consistent</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">well like set of terms to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:39.760" style="s2">obviously that can uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.760" style="s2">i can probably tie into the whole uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.760" end="00:51:42.960" style="s2">universal religious language that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.760" end="00:51:44.720" style="s2">of been alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.960" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">where we try to get all the like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.720" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">religions speaking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">if we can have a religion a a language</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">where we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">all the religions at once essentially in</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">the same terms</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">and our own the retina in the end that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">would be pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">yeah uh in the video that was uh where</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">john komsky uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:12.000" style="s2">commented on kamsky&#39;s universal grammar</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">and how it was constructed via ai right</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.000" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah no i also had that in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">notes um and yeah i basically wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">make a very similar point</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">right you could compile i&#39;m sorry sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">um yeah i was just gonna say uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">well i was just gonna add to so you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">actually go ahead um i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">well you&#39;re just yeah just compiling a</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">synonymous list</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">right like when i say soul</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:43.760" style="s2">and when i say opman when i say what am</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:44.960" style="s2">i really meaning when i say all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.760" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">things according to each of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.960" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">and then if there&#39;s a commonality of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.160" end="00:52:52.960" style="s2">that notion</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">having a good list of synonyms and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.960" end="00:52:58.880" style="s2">being able to extract from that group</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">the essence right</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.880" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">kind of maintain the continuity of of uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">of understanding across the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">major</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">religious modalities yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.839" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s building</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:31.440" style="s2">the glass i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:33.359" style="s2">um but you know actually for in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">having religion speak to each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.359" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">it won&#39;t be enough to have the terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">like utman and soul you know it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">just be</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">what those terms are it will be what</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:45.280" style="s2">those terms are in</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">uh rel or in comparison to other terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.280" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">within the same language</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">and then the the the relative</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">differences in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">will be what tells you how to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">languages of the religion i think that</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:03.280" style="s2">will probably be true in cases of</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">deeply integrated concepts and concepts</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.280" end="00:54:06.880" style="s2">that are inherently ambiguous</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">but there are probably quite a few that</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.880" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">you can that are that are well</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">constellated</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">right like it&#39;s like the notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">soul um</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">the notion of an afterlife notion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">uh history and all this stuff right well</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">i would say yes and no because the issue</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">is it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">you know take buddhism versus</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:28.079" style="s2">christianity for example it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">both have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.079" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">an idea of a soul but they both have an</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">idea of a soul</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">that that um where the soul</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">is in some sense important in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">the journey towards heaven</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">but the journey towards heaven is very</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">in terms of buddhism and christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">the way that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">heaven influences the idea of a soul is</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">very very important</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s those kinds of differences</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:54.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:56.720" style="s2">you&#39;re right to some degree with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.640" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">concepts but the the trick comes in</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.720" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">because the religions are always like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:02.720" style="s2">whole system with a world view and they</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">they work by tying the concept together</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.720" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s always a highly systematized</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">and so to actually get at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">functionality it&#39;s not enough to just</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">get at the concept you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">get at the con</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">the relationships between the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">yes right so i think like metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to make some</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">sacrifices and that will always be true</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.760" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">in order to yeah well well i i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:29.119" style="s2">what the question there would be is like</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">in terms of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.119" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">what are there any commonalities between</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">all of the religions that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:38.880" style="s2">well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">of content but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:45.359" style="s2">commonalities of context</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">and right all of it what is there any</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.359" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">commonality we can identify whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">because if there isn&#39;t any commonality</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">then we don&#39;t have a hope of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">constructing a universal grammar</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">we have to look for some kind of common</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">feature or</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">something that that we can that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:01.440" style="s2">use as the first step</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">if we have that then everything else can</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.440" end="00:56:04.240" style="s2">more or less follow</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">okay i don&#39;t know that might be getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">like a couple of steps ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">i really again i think it has a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">do with</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">so from my own perspective and i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">interject this um</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">and then i probably have to take off but</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">there&#39;s very much of maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">if there if there are any hierarchies it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:35.040" style="s2">has to do with precedent</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:37.119" style="s2">that which has to exist prior to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.040" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">construction of any higher thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.119" end="00:56:40.799" style="s2">and that which feeds into right so</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:42.839" style="s2">there&#39;s there are deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.799" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">interrelationships that stack up in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.839" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">way and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">if one is you know deeply unable to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">provide food</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">it makes it very difficult for you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">have any interest in you know any amount</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">of uh religious mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:02.000" style="s2">structure it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">obtain meaning from these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.640" style="s2">but as you ascend up into higher and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:08.480" style="s2">higher orders of complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.640" end="00:57:09.680" style="s2">interrelatedness at the social layer you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.480" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.680" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">you need more and more stories and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:15.920" style="s2">and more narratives and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">propositions to teach about how those</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.920" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">relationships are to function</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">in the more complex space</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">so do you want to look at hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">well we already discussed hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:33.040" style="s2">but it has more to do with like</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.799" style="s2">where individuals are in their own</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.040" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">particular hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">and then whether or not where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:41.040" style="s2">situated</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">currently is providing it&#39;s meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.040" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">needs of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">of what their distressed environment</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:55.839" style="s2">appears as</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that hierarchy by the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.359" end="00:58:06.079" style="s2">there&#39;s something else that happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">a little more common</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.079" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">in this space which has to do with uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">world views</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:16.160" style="s2">and i&#39;ll use just the low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:19.680" style="s2">left and right hemispherical</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.160" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">preferences but it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.680" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">people to agree upon certain kinds</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:29.359" style="s2">of moral and ethical considerations</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">based on these these radically different</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.359" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">views of analyzing the world so</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">um yeah that often is you could consider</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.920" style="s2">that a perennial</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">problem in the construction of a shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.920" end="00:58:43.040" style="s2">mythopoetic structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">yeah well i would agree with that but</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:48.839" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">you see that that&#39;s where you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.839" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">and see with even within the different</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">views and the conflicting views can you</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">where are the commonalities at least not</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.280" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">in terms of what they say</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">but in terms of the way that they speak</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">because if you can&#39;t get that then the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">idea of of having a universal</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">religious grammar will work because you</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.839" style="s2">will always have</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">um there will always be no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.839" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">grammar you create to tie religions</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">there will always be at least one</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:27.200" style="s2">religion that sits outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.839" end="00:59:33.839" style="s2">grammar</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">okay so what else do we need to look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="01:00:01.680" style="s2">to define the scope of the problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:03.760" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve got a lot to chew on</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.680" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">already maybe we&#39;ve got death we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.760" end="01:00:07.520" style="s2">hierarchies we&#39;ve got narrative</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m going to try and go back and</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.079" end="01:00:14.319" style="s2">write all of this down</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:16.000" style="s2">afterwards that&#39;s the point yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.319" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">so cool</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.000" end="01:00:19.440" style="s2">the main points i&#39;ve got is that bruins</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">looking at the narrative of other</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.440" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">religions which</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">which i&#39;m guessing will um include the</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">um the grammar and the terms that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">they&#39;re using and their world views</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:35.599" style="s2">and their metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">veloskin&#39;s looking at the perennial</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.599" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:41.920" style="s2">and if we&#39;re having someone look at</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">perennial problems do we need someone to</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.920" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">be looking at</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">the the thing that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">got a definition for yet the good parts</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">of life</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">the things that are um are blocked by</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:57.920" style="s2">the problems</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">no i thought maybe we can call them like</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">perennial needs</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.810" end="01:01:14.940" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">would you guys uh see community</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.240" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">as solving a problem</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">exactly yeah absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">okay for sure yes perennial solutions</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:36.240" style="s2">well no it&#39;s it&#39;s me it&#39;s the drivers</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:38.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.240" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">forward drivers that that are blocked by</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.559" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">the problems</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">all right perennial needs sounds good to</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:44.000" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:47.760" style="s2">and then i think tyler wanted to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.480" end="01:01:52.079" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.760" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">right this piagetian uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">take on things which i think is relevant</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">okay so strewn&#39;s got narratives of other</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.880" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">religions</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">tyler&#39;s got um hierarchies relationships</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">so often&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">perennial problems um does anyone want</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:10.480" style="s2">to do perennial needs</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">am i grabbing that one then</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">because like we should do problems and</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">needs intense if you want it</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:32.799" style="s2">yes it&#39;s kind of kind of combined but</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.160" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s two sides of the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.799" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:37.359" style="s2">besides the same thing i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.359" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">exactly but what i would say is that if</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">they match up</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">you have a better chance of of realizing</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">that you have complete lists on both</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:49.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s certainly worth at least</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">approaching them there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.359" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">instead of trying so if i have my list</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:55.839" style="s2">and veloskin has his list then we come</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">together and we&#39;re like wait a sec</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.839" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">there&#39;s five things on my list that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">don&#39;t match up with any of the things on</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:02.559" style="s2">your list and vice versa then</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve missed something but we&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">that we&#39;ll find the other part</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">yeah i doubt it&#39;ll be that it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">that straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">yeah yeah it won&#39;t be that clear that</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">idea yeah yeah well the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:20.559" style="s2">the the list of perennial problems will</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:22.480" style="s2">basically be a list of things to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">the list of perennial needs will</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.480" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">basically be a list of things</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">should try and get so yeah there will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">like there will be opposites but like</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:32.960" style="s2">you i think you won&#39;t find an overlap of</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">of the same things</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.960" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">you will find an overlap of opposition</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">yeah restrict overlap but there will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">some things that are related</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:45.119" style="s2">yeah definitely okay well i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">perennial needs then</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.119" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">well i i i saw the pruning problems as</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:50.960" style="s2">something we&#39;re trying to solve like</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">we are trying to avoid self-esteem</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">right now we&#39;re trying to define what</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">the problems are right</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you can solve a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.599" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">perennial problem i think that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">goal must be to cope with the problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:11.599" style="s2">i i i know what you mean it&#39;s not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">not going to sort of finally</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.599" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">extinguish the perennial problems from</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">the universe you&#39;re not going to fix</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:19.280" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">no yeah but we&#39;re going to respond</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.280" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">like maybe we should use john&#39;s town we</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">will need to address the premier commons</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">yeah responding to the perennial problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">yeah but just the project is just to get</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:36.079" style="s2">the lists done</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">first and then worry about what to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.079" end="01:04:38.400" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.640" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re defining the problem first</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:43.839" style="s2">and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:45.280" style="s2">looking into the problem more to define</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.839" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">it better</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.280" end="01:04:50.960" style="s2">right okay so do we ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:54.880" style="s2">for separate channels for these four</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.960" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">sections within retina</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.880" end="01:05:00.000" style="s2">no i think you can just i mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:01.200" style="s2">because like we&#39;re seeing channels</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.000" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.200" end="01:05:05.039" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know the channels</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:06.400" style="s2">are what you need necessarily i think if</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.039" end="01:05:07.920" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have discussions you can</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.400" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">just have it in the written our channel</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.920" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2">for now</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">and then what the output of this should</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:15.839" style="s2">be something</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:17.920" style="s2">like a report or a write-up</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.839" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">or something that again people can look</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.920" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">at and get agreement on</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:25.359" style="s2">right okay so maybe like a bunch uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">different pinned documents and then um</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.359" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">that people will cut people can come and</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">say okay i want help with this i want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">help with that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.599" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">right and then we&#39;ll pin a document</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.119" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">called you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">current research or something right and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:43.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:45.280" style="s2">list who&#39;s in charge of the research and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.839" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">then if people want to help they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.280" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">help or</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.160" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something that isn&#39;t assigned</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">with a person in charge they can</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:55.280" style="s2">volunteer to take charge for example</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">so we need an organizing document and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.280" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">then we&#39;ll each create a</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">document on the section we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:05.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">put those in there does that make sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.680" end="01:06:09.440" style="s2">yeah or we can have them as google docs</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.760" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">or whatever yeah we can certainly work</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.440" end="01:06:13.119" style="s2">on the technology is not important right</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:14.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just just understanding what the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.119" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">output should be</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.799" end="01:06:19.839" style="s2">and that is more important</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.079" end="01:06:24.799" style="s2">all right awesome i&#39;ve got to go about</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.200" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">now so</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.799" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">good luck if you&#39;re continuing and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:34.640" style="s2">not and i&#39;ll see you guys next week</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">i&#39;m going to keep recording for about</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.640" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">another hour i&#39;m going to stop</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.400" end="01:06:55.599" style="s2">as well what else is there to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.760" end="01:06:58.720" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.599" end="01:07:00.400" style="s2">well i&#39;m going to throw this word in</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.720" end="01:07:02.559" style="s2">and everyone else is going to tell me</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.400" end="01:07:06.480" style="s2">the answers because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.559" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">sure i really can say much about it um</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.480" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">so scalability we want it to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">fit into</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">like every part of society so different</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:18.960" style="s2">socio-economic classes</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">as well as you know developmental stages</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.960" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">childhood adulthood and so on</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.839" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">well i have something to say about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">but i&#39;ll sound like a broken record so</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:31.599" style="s2">it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">so scalability in general is a</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">multivariate thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:46.079" style="s2">right so there&#39;s scalability of how you</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.480" end="01:07:52.880" style="s2">hello</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:08:00.000" style="s2">oh i thought that was me cutting out so</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.039" end="01:08:00.000" style="s2">i was just about to reconnect</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">yeah sorry about that scalability</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.039" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">along many lines right so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:11.520" style="s2">availability of audience</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:14.240" style="s2">scalability of how you spread</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.520" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">the word right within that audience so</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.240" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.640" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">has obviously right and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:26.400" style="s2">the scalability around how it&#39;s accessed</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">right to accommodate the different</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.400" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">audiences so same thing might have four</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">or five access points for example</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:35.679" style="s2">based on you know what appeals to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">different groups</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.679" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve already mentioned the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">kind of trying to make different hooks</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:44.640" style="s2">for different temperaments or something</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.239" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">yeah and just being able to spread it</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.279" style="s2">right like how do you get it</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.520" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">the people who need it sort of a thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.279" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.880" end="01:09:06.239" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.440" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.239" end="01:09:10.080" style="s2">that the word always comes up is</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">scalability</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.080" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">and the context for scalability there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:16.159" style="s2">how do we spread the ecology of</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:17.759" style="s2">practices to a lot of people even</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.159" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">assuming they want to engage right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.759" end="01:09:21.679" style="s2">not even getting into the</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">how do we make it appealing to a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.679" end="01:09:24.719" style="s2">people we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">we&#39;re getting let&#39;s assume everybody</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.719" end="01:09:27.839" style="s2">wanted this</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:29.839" style="s2">how the heck would we get into all these</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:32.839" style="s2">people that&#39;s because that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.839" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">variable in the scalability</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.839" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.719" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">are you hoping to discuss scalability in</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.839" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">general or just get a better handle on</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:52.319" style="s2">scalability or</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:54.080" style="s2">you know what&#39;s your goal in bringing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.319" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">up to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.080" end="01:10:00.800" style="s2">it just seems pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">but i also feel like i&#39;m just supremely</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.800" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">ignorant and i was interested</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">to see if anybody had any good thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.840" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:15.840" style="s2">but anyway well i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:18.719" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m quite familiar with what paul</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.840" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">had to say about scalability</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.719" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">because he always mentions how jesus</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:25.199" style="s2">scales right</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:27.360" style="s2">um and the thing that he says that</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.199" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">what&#39;s remarkable about jesus</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.360" end="01:10:34.159" style="s2">is that he died and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">he had a couple of uh the fishermen or</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.159" end="01:10:36.400" style="s2">whatever you know basically illiterate</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.400" end="01:10:40.159" style="s2">who were his witnesses and they wrote</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:41.760" style="s2">his story down</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.159" end="01:10:44.000" style="s2">ended up basically taking over the whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">world and it lasted for</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.000" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">well today 2 000 years so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:51.120" style="s2">something that scales</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:52.640" style="s2">because it works for to basically work</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:56.000" style="s2">for an entire people to live</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.640" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">the way that jesus said and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.000" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">paul&#39;s concern with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">scalability and written or</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">would be uh yeah well you know can it</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.920" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">actually do something</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">like what jesus accomplished and how</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:10.560" style="s2">would you actually go about accomplish</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">if you were in his shoes or if you you</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.560" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">know you had that opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.640" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">how would you go about doing it what</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">would you</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">right so that&#39;s time scalability plus</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:23.520" style="s2">audience scalability</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:31.120" style="s2">plus um reproductive scalability i</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.040" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.120" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of time</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">scalability right time scalability</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">implies that you have to change</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:41.600" style="s2">or evolve or whatever with the as</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:43.440" style="s2">as as things on the ground change right</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.600" end="01:11:45.120" style="s2">and that that implies that</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.440" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">in order to do that you need some sort</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.120" end="01:11:48.320" style="s2">of interactive feedback mechanism so</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.320" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">in touch with the people that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:54.960" style="s2">serving</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:56.239" style="s2">uh and yeah i i i don&#39;t disagree but um</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.960" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">i was more meaning like you know you</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.239" end="01:11:58.880" style="s2">have the individual then you have the</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">town then you have the state and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.880" end="01:12:04.320" style="s2">have the country then you have the world</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">like that kind of reproduction but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.320" end="01:12:09.840" style="s2">that&#39;s hierarchical scalability</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.159" end="01:12:17.280" style="s2">my answer to you depends on whether or</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.760" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">not i&#39;m supposed to be attacking the</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.280" end="01:12:22.800" style="s2">idea of an iron age hierarchy or not</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.000" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">like that that that&#39;s fraud territory i</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.800" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">yeah i know i i i understand that</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:32.320" style="s2">all right so to bridge that gap why</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:35.520" style="s2">don&#39;t we call it structural scalability</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.320" end="01:12:36.320" style="s2">is that fair yeah i could live with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.520" end="01:12:38.239" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.320" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">sure all right so that&#39;s another type of</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.239" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">scalability you want to watch out for</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:46.159" style="s2">yeah so that happens very much so so</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:47.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.159" end="01:12:49.600" style="s2">said a bunch of scalability for you is</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.920" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">that is that good for</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.600" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">discussing scalability or do you need</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.280" end="01:12:56.640" style="s2">more or do you want more</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">on that i don&#39;t think that&#39;s exhaustive</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.640" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">but at least it gives us an idea of how</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:01.920" style="s2">big the scalability issue is because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s one word that means</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.920" end="01:13:05.840" style="s2">lots of things with multiple dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.440" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">i think he was asking you velocin i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.520" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">i see</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.560" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">i i&#39;m sort of mildly disturbed by</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.880" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">just being seen as a leader right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.199" end="01:13:41.440" style="s2">well you brought up the word i wasn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:42.800" style="s2">wasn&#39;t implying anything i was just</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.440" end="01:13:45.040" style="s2">trying to find out if</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.800" end="01:13:46.800" style="s2">that helped you with with what your goal</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.040" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">was in bringing up the word or not</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.800" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m just poking the collective and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">seeing what happens oh crap how do i</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">hurt these cats i don&#39;t hate these cats</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.080" end="01:14:05.280" style="s2">no well i think it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">a reasonable thing to bring up</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.280" end="01:14:08.719" style="s2">certainly oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.159" end="01:14:13.920" style="s2">i mean if the goal was just to create a</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.679" end="01:14:15.760" style="s2">bunch of a bunch of angry hornets that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.920" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">you know you created two angry hornets</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.760" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">congratulations</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:23.520" style="s2">yeah the thing that i have in brackets</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.679" end="01:14:25.920" style="s2">for my notes was that i think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.520" end="01:14:27.679" style="s2">heroes in some sense have something to</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.920" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">do with scalability</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.679" end="01:14:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.440" end="01:14:36.080" style="s2">this there&#39;s something about the way</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.760" end="01:14:37.840" style="s2">that we craft heroes within stories that</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.080" end="01:14:39.440" style="s2">is very very sticky and we pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.840" end="01:14:41.679" style="s2">to it and we remain</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.440" end="01:14:42.719" style="s2">and i think it might have something to</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.679" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">do with the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.719" end="01:14:47.120" style="s2">you know that was the way we had to tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:48.800" style="s2">stories in order to</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.120" end="01:14:50.880" style="s2">transmit our old traditions before we</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.800" end="01:14:54.000" style="s2">had writing and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.880" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">it seems to me that the that our ability</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.000" end="01:14:58.640" style="s2">to pay attention to particular</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:58.640" style="s2">characters would be</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">it could be something that has evolved</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.239" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">so that we actually are able better able</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:08.480" style="s2">to remember</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.520" end="01:15:09.679" style="s2">the necessary features of a hero that if</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.480" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">we try and embody</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.679" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">will lead us to success in our life</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:16.159" style="s2">and i think if we&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:19.040" style="s2">something that scales we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.159" end="01:15:22.320" style="s2">have to have something that actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.040" end="01:15:25.840" style="s2">can can appropriate the</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.320" end="01:15:29.679" style="s2">the evolutionary structures that have to</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.840" end="01:15:29.679" style="s2">do with with hero formulation</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">and could be perhaps you can tell me if</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.480" end="01:15:39.199" style="s2">it&#39;s already been done but</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:40.719" style="s2">we we&#39;re going to have the hero</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.199" end="01:15:44.400" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.719" end="01:15:47.790" style="s2">maybe we could have like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.400" end="01:15:49.840" style="s2">society hero so like the</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.790" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.840" end="01:15:54.800" style="s2">like the society&#39;s version of a hero</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:16:01.520" style="s2">you mean like jesus collective hero like</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.280" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">jesus is a individual that individuals</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.520" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">emulate</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.320" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">okay maybe we could have sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">vision for what our society is meant to</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:12.480" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.080" end="01:16:17.760" style="s2">i would say jesus was not a hero</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.159" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">yeah okay but that&#39;s kind of besides the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.600" end="01:16:24.080" style="s2">point um</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:25.440" style="s2">the like what would what would a</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.080" end="01:16:29.360" style="s2">collective hero look like</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.440" end="01:16:29.920" style="s2">exactly like is it is it a group of</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.360" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.920" end="01:16:35.600" style="s2">or is it one person that is just like</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">group like or what are you talking about</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.600" end="01:16:42.000" style="s2">well we&#39;ve got the the hero individual</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">who&#39;s like the ideal of a person</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.000" end="01:16:45.199" style="s2">maybe yeah so but you want the idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:47.360" style="s2">collective but no</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.199" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">right so but i&#39;m asking you how how</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.360" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">would you go about</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:51.760" style="s2">talking about that ideal</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.920" end="01:16:55.440" style="s2">but i think there&#39;s an assumption</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.840" end="01:16:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s an assumption built in there</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.440" end="01:16:58.880" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.880" end="01:17:00.960" style="s2">that the collective is not an emerging</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.880" end="01:17:02.640" style="s2">property of a bunch of people acting in</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.960" end="01:17:04.719" style="s2">heroic fashion</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.640" end="01:17:06.960" style="s2">yeah well that that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.719" end="01:17:08.400" style="s2">the difficulties because like</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.960" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about collective isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.400" end="01:17:14.400" style="s2">it a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:16.480" style="s2">right right so so if if the collective</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.400" end="01:17:18.800" style="s2">is just a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.480" end="01:17:20.239" style="s2">and they cohere to the degree that their</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.800" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">heroes</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.239" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">which can be different have enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">similarities</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:28.560" style="s2">to engender cohesion then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">more or less an emerging property that</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.560" end="01:17:32.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t control directly but you</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:34.000" style="s2">control indirect i mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.320" end="01:17:35.600" style="s2">jordan peterson makes this point right</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.000" end="01:17:38.159" style="s2">like if everybody just</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.600" end="01:17:39.679" style="s2">works on themselves then the world will</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:41.920" style="s2">magically be a better place and that is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.679" end="01:17:45.280" style="s2">necessarily true but</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.920" end="01:17:45.760" style="s2">uh he doesn&#39;t focus on on like that mid</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.280" end="01:17:47.840" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.760" end="01:17:49.040" style="s2">like don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t he says don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.840" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">out and try to make the</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.040" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">society a better place just make</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:55.520" style="s2">yourself a better a better person and</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:58.719" style="s2">everything will take care of itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.520" end="01:18:01.199" style="s2">yeah i think um</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.719" end="01:18:03.199" style="s2">well the closest that i can think of to</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.199" end="01:18:06.400" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.199" end="01:18:09.840" style="s2">the collective idea would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.400" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">david gamel&#39;s novels the</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.840" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">however</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.920" end="01:18:17.600" style="s2">the draenei tales um because there he</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:19.679" style="s2">had the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.600" end="01:18:21.199" style="s2">he did like a weird neoplatonic thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.679" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">with the thirty</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.199" end="01:18:27.440" style="s2">um and there were these thirty uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">like warrior priest type things um and</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.440" end="01:18:30.400" style="s2">they had these spiritual powers but they</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">also had excellent</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.400" end="01:18:34.159" style="s2">uh martial combatability and then they</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:36.880" style="s2">would basically go</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.159" end="01:18:38.239" style="s2">you know in into a war and all except</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.880" end="01:18:40.880" style="s2">one of them would die</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.239" end="01:18:42.800" style="s2">but then in the story itself like one of</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.880" end="01:18:45.199" style="s2">the things that the city could do</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.800" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">was to spiritually join in to form the</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.199" end="01:18:47.280" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:49.679" style="s2">and i mean well that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.280" end="01:18:51.440" style="s2">neoplaton neoplatonism comes in because</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.679" end="01:18:52.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s all of those neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:56.080" style="s2">tropes but</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.960" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">i suppose you could kind of maybe</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.080" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">symbolize</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.800" style="s2">a collective hero as a hero that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:02.719" style="s2">constructed out of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.800" end="01:19:04.080" style="s2">let&#39;s say 30 individuals and becomes you</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:06.320" style="s2">know one individual</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.080" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">out of the individuals you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.320" end="01:19:10.560" style="s2">like a it&#39;s a collective but it is an</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:13.120" style="s2">individual at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.560" end="01:19:13.679" style="s2">but yeah i don&#39;t know if if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.120" end="01:19:15.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.679" end="01:19:17.360" style="s2">that&#39;s about the only way that i could</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.360" end="01:19:18.480" style="s2">think of going about</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.360" end="01:19:23.280" style="s2">the sort of thing that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.480" end="01:19:26.800" style="s2">about it&#39;s a curtain</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.280" end="01:19:27.920" style="s2">maybe the hero archetype itself mediates</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.920" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">being a good person and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:36.719" style="s2">being so in a way that makes a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:40.080" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.719" end="01:19:41.679" style="s2">yeah well that that yeah that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.080" end="01:19:43.199" style="s2">at least that was was the idea behind</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.679" end="01:19:46.880" style="s2">christianity i think</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.199" end="01:19:51.520" style="s2">uh yeah also deep degree uh buddhism uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.880" end="01:19:54.880" style="s2">taoism i&#39;m not so sure about um</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.520" end="01:19:57.360" style="s2">and yeah i think that&#39;s certainly true</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.880" end="01:19:58.640" style="s2">right like like heroes go out and get</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.360" end="01:19:59.760" style="s2">something for the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:01.600" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.760" end="01:20:02.960" style="s2">and the thing that they the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.600" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.960" end="01:20:07.120" style="s2">is sacrificing their potential in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:11.280" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.120" end="01:20:14.080" style="s2">right to uh to benefit the community</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.280" end="01:20:14.719" style="s2">so that is communal in nature generally</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.080" end="01:20:17.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.719" end="01:20:18.320" style="s2">because heroes generally don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.280" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">be uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.320" end="01:20:24.560" style="s2">selfish right by definition if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:24.560" style="s2">selfish they&#39;re not good heroes</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.760" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know but that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:33.199" style="s2">debatable</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:33.199" style="s2">generally generally</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.760" end="01:20:38.239" style="s2">i used all the weasel words i could well</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.880" end="01:20:41.120" style="s2">i i definitely think look</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.239" end="01:20:41.120" style="s2">that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:47.920" style="s2">especially with respect to heroism it is</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.000" end="01:20:50.320" style="s2">a question of how do you sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.920" end="01:20:52.159" style="s2">heroic</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.320" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">i think christianity is is probably the</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.159" end="01:20:55.120" style="s2">religion that is most</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.840" end="01:20:59.360" style="s2">most focused upon that question</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of forms of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.760" end="01:21:04.719" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:06.400" style="s2">like right but but jesus&#39;s sacrifice is</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.719" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">the ultimate sacrifice right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.400" end="01:21:09.600" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">well yeah like how do you like like</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.600" end="01:21:14.639" style="s2">christianity is really trying to</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:17.120" style="s2">to give the the answer to like how do</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.639" end="01:21:19.440" style="s2">you sacrifice properly yourself</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.120" end="01:21:19.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.719" end="01:21:25.840" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t focus on one it doesn&#39;t focus</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:27.679" style="s2">on the one</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.840" end="01:21:29.679" style="s2">sacrifice though right and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.679" end="01:21:31.360" style="s2">would be a deep mistake</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.679" end="01:21:32.880" style="s2">right i mean yeah you have to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.360" end="01:21:34.960" style="s2">the ultimate sacrifice but</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.880" end="01:21:36.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t you don&#39;t build your society</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.960" end="01:21:39.040" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.480" end="01:21:41.040" style="s2">you know the ultimate sacrifice because</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.040" end="01:21:42.480" style="s2">that&#39;s called a death cult and i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.040" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s the direction we want to go</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.480" end="01:21:44.800" style="s2">in you can correct me if i&#39;m wrong but</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:46.080" style="s2">i&#39;m fairly sure</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.800" end="01:21:47.840" style="s2">we&#39;re in agreement that that would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.080" end="01:21:51.360" style="s2">bad so let&#39;s not do that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.840" end="01:21:54.880" style="s2">um so yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.360" end="01:21:58.719" style="s2">um yeah you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.880" end="01:22:02.159" style="s2">and right who sacrifices his wildness to</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.719" end="01:22:04.400" style="s2">engage in a bunch of other adventures</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.159" end="01:22:06.320" style="s2">in some sense right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.400" end="01:22:08.800" style="s2">definitely different levels of sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.320" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">and different types of sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.800" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">and reasons not to make those sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">examples in in mythos where one hero</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:17.040" style="s2">makes one sacrificial choice and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">other makes</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.040" end="01:22:20.320" style="s2">basically the opposite type of a choice</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.320" end="01:22:24.159" style="s2">you just get one right like you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.639" end="01:22:26.080" style="s2">this guy to be here or this guy because</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.159" end="01:22:30.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t make both sacrifices</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.080" end="01:22:34.239" style="s2">so yeah i think that&#39;s important right</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.080" end="01:22:34.239" style="s2">yeah there are lots of examples yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:40.480" style="s2">yeah i know i mean that yeah that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.400" end="01:22:42.560" style="s2">definitely an ongoing conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.480" end="01:22:44.560" style="s2">but i think i mean yeah i think like a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.560" end="01:22:47.760" style="s2">big part of religion is about</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.560" end="01:22:50.840" style="s2">um recording that conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.760" end="01:22:53.840" style="s2">keeping the spirit of the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.840" end="01:22:55.840" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.840" end="01:22:57.360" style="s2">right well we have a way to keep spirits</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.840" end="01:23:01.520" style="s2">of conversations alive so</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:01.520" style="s2">that&#39;s already solved thank goodness</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.320" end="01:23:06.639" style="s2">like um humans have a tendency to try</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:09.679" style="s2">and remember the things that are worth</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.639" end="01:23:09.679" style="s2">sacrificing for</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.320" end="01:23:13.920" style="s2">and so that you know there but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.320" end="01:23:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s our earlier debates you know people</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.920" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">will always</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.480" end="01:23:17.120" style="s2">they will value different things so</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.760" end="01:23:18.560" style="s2">they&#39;ll think different things are worth</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.120" end="01:23:22.560" style="s2">sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:25.199" style="s2">right but the hero within this</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.560" end="01:23:26.400" style="s2">context i guess is the the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.199" end="01:23:28.639" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.400" end="01:23:30.320" style="s2">shows us what the sacrifice looks like</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.639" end="01:23:31.679" style="s2">so that we can do it ourselves if we</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.320" end="01:23:34.960" style="s2">actually agree with</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.679" end="01:23:37.600" style="s2">what it&#39;s supposed to yeah your</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.960" end="01:23:40.159" style="s2">story will be what tells us the like how</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.600" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">the whole thing plays out again</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.159" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">right it gives us a template for an</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:46.239" style="s2">acting at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:48.000" style="s2">so yeah we get to see what might be we</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.239" end="01:23:50.080" style="s2">get to see all the possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.000" end="01:23:52.000" style="s2">right and then we get to see the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.080" end="01:23:55.679" style="s2">based on success and</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.000" end="01:23:57.199" style="s2">and and to paul&#39;s bender clay&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.679" end="01:23:59.360" style="s2">right you want to see the outcome</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.199" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">based on failure too and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.360" end="01:24:07.040" style="s2">kind of missed some of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.840" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">yeah well um i think uh john also said</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.040" end="01:24:12.239" style="s2">something similar because</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:14.719" style="s2">the greek stories around hubris people</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.239" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">forget their mortality</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.719" end="01:24:18.000" style="s2">you know they forget their mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">right i think yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.000" end="01:24:22.159" style="s2">that that&#39;s definitely i wonder i</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:24.960" style="s2">suppose that would be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.159" end="01:24:24.960" style="s2">perennial problem</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.719" end="01:24:30.159" style="s2">possibly yeah yeah i mean you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.199" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">to have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.159" end="01:24:34.480" style="s2">opposite too much humility too little</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.600" end="01:24:36.639" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.480" end="01:24:40.159" style="s2">right those are probably perennial</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.639" end="01:24:40.159" style="s2">problems navigating humility</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:44.000" style="s2">i wonder what too much humility actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.639" end="01:24:46.480" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.000" end="01:24:47.360" style="s2">a question well it&#39;s an underestimation</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.480" end="01:24:50.639" style="s2">of your</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.360" end="01:24:53.840" style="s2">capacities there&#39;s a lot of people right</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.639" end="01:24:55.920" style="s2">in fact my friend has it he</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.840" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">he underestimates his abilities and it</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.920" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">makes him sort of</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.679" end="01:25:13.840" style="s2">oh yeah no i agree yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.199" end="01:25:18.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to prematurely close on</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.880" end="01:25:20.800" style="s2">your potential if you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.480" end="01:25:20.800" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.199" end="01:25:26.239" style="s2">yeah well in my opinion generally</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.840" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">self-potentialization</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.239" end="01:25:30.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying i agree with that actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:32.159" style="s2">earlier when you said the hero</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.480" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">sacrifices potential in the future i was</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.159" end="01:25:35.440" style="s2">like no no</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:35.440" style="s2">no no no</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.159" end="01:25:39.520" style="s2">can i offer i get what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.920" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">say though yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:44.000" style="s2">yeah you say uh so i&#39;m not disagreeing</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:47.199" style="s2">with anybody i&#39;m just offering</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.000" end="01:25:50.159" style="s2">a different lens or or let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.199" end="01:25:50.719" style="s2">put a different color over the light to</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.159" end="01:25:52.159" style="s2">reveal</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.719" end="01:25:54.000" style="s2">different things if you&#39;ve ever looked</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.159" end="01:25:57.120" style="s2">at like a flannel shirt</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.000" end="01:25:59.760" style="s2">in a nightclub as the lights change</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.120" end="01:26:00.960" style="s2">the pattern on the shirt also changes so</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.760" end="01:26:03.360" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.960" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">if just offering different things you</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.360" end="01:26:09.760" style="s2">can kind of reframe your perception but</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:13.120" style="s2">as you guys are talking about this um</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.760" end="01:26:16.000" style="s2">my mind is going to a different place</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.120" end="01:26:17.440" style="s2">so sacrifice is on my mind as the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.000" end="01:26:20.639" style="s2">primary thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.440" end="01:26:23.920" style="s2">but in my mind sacrifice is a</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.639" end="01:26:28.080" style="s2">function of productivity right so</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.920" end="01:26:30.080" style="s2">a hero is a champion what are champions</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.080" end="01:26:31.280" style="s2">what makes someone a champion they have</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.080" end="01:26:33.520" style="s2">to win</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:35.600" style="s2">right often is said pride comes before</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.520" end="01:26:37.120" style="s2">the fall that&#39;s not actually true pride</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.600" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">comes after the win</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.120" end="01:26:42.159" style="s2">and so um if we have pride in our heroes</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s because they have done</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.159" end="01:26:48.960" style="s2">something productive um oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:49.600" style="s2">talk is not productive uh forming</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.960" end="01:26:52.639" style="s2">committees</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.600" end="01:26:54.880" style="s2">is not productive um uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.639" end="01:26:55.679" style="s2">writing books is not productive</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.880" end="01:26:58.719" style="s2">publishing</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.679" end="01:27:02.159" style="s2">books is productive right so</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.719" end="01:27:05.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a there is a real world</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.159" end="01:27:08.159" style="s2">benefit to actually producing</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.360" end="01:27:08.800" style="s2">something that can be held in your hand</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.159" end="01:27:12.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.800" end="01:27:12.880" style="s2">um i think sacrifice has that quality</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.159" end="01:27:15.679" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.880" end="01:27:16.239" style="s2">sacrifice for its own sake is stupid</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.679" end="01:27:19.199" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.239" end="01:27:21.440" style="s2">essentially fasting and no one holds a</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.199" end="01:27:22.400" style="s2">hero in highest regard simply because he</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.440" end="01:27:25.120" style="s2">fasted enough</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:27.440" style="s2">right gandhi might be an exception but</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.120" end="01:27:31.040" style="s2">he was also quite a piece of shit so</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.440" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">like the um</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.040" end="01:27:35.199" style="s2">i guess what i&#39;m trying to offer is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.520" end="01:27:37.440" style="s2">i i do believe that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.199" end="01:27:40.239" style="s2">productivity to heroism</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.440" end="01:27:41.600" style="s2">and and there has to be a win you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.239" end="01:27:43.840" style="s2">to be the champion</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.600" end="01:27:44.719" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t really matter how you got</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.840" end="01:27:47.520" style="s2">there either</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.719" end="01:27:48.560" style="s2">if you win and your opponents are dead</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.520" end="01:27:50.719" style="s2">you&#39;re the hero</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.560" end="01:27:52.159" style="s2">regardless of how of of what you did to</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.719" end="01:27:53.360" style="s2">get there and as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.159" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">supplying</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.360" end="01:27:57.679" style="s2">some level of productivity for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.440" end="01:27:59.360" style="s2">audience they are going to hold you as a</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.679" end="01:28:00.560" style="s2">hero now the other thing i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.360" end="01:28:03.760" style="s2">mention was</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.560" end="01:28:04.400" style="s2">um heroes have a mysterious quality to</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.760" end="01:28:08.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.400" end="01:28:11.520" style="s2">part of what makes a hero a hero is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.000" end="01:28:12.480" style="s2">they are a champion but very little is</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.520" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">actually known</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.480" end="01:28:16.159" style="s2">about their thought process their</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">motivations</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.159" end="01:28:19.920" style="s2">or what drives them and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:23.280" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.920" end="01:28:25.120" style="s2">endears us to the hero is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.280" end="01:28:25.679" style="s2">know where their source of power comes</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.120" end="01:28:28.320" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.679" end="01:28:29.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if they they have this</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.320" end="01:28:31.760" style="s2">extra</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.360" end="01:28:32.800" style="s2">judicial quality to them like like think</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.760" end="01:28:35.280" style="s2">of hercules right</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.800" end="01:28:36.239" style="s2">he was a demigod he had the blood of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.280" end="01:28:38.239" style="s2">gods in him</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.239" end="01:28:40.080" style="s2">something that humans can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.239" end="01:28:43.040" style="s2">achieve and so</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.080" end="01:28:44.960" style="s2">that hero was able to be productive in</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.040" end="01:28:46.960" style="s2">ways that other peoples weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.960" end="01:28:48.639" style="s2">leading to him to be a champion now that</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.960" end="01:28:51.040" style="s2">might be complete and utter horseshit i</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.639" end="01:28:54.080" style="s2">just wanted to put it out there just to</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.040" end="01:28:56.159" style="s2">let your minds start spinning</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.080" end="01:28:58.080" style="s2">um well i just wanted to on the first</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.159" end="01:29:01.760" style="s2">point sort of uh respond because</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.080" end="01:29:03.280" style="s2">um the word sacrifice literally means to</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.760" end="01:29:04.400" style="s2">make sacred so in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.280" end="01:29:07.520" style="s2">productivity</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.400" end="01:29:08.960" style="s2">like yeah making it&#39;s not making if it</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.520" end="01:29:12.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t productive</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.960" end="01:29:14.159" style="s2">so sacrifice is making sacred therefore</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.159" end="01:29:19.920" style="s2">sacrifice has to be productive</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.159" end="01:29:19.920" style="s2">um yeah basically i agree with you 100</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.000" end="01:29:25.280" style="s2">it means to cause to be sacred by the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.000" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.280" end="01:29:28.639" style="s2">in the sense of make sacred</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.040" end="01:29:34.080" style="s2">not make sacredly um</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.159" end="01:29:36.080" style="s2">no no well i mean like artifices like</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.080" end="01:29:38.560" style="s2">you know if you if you if</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.080" end="01:29:41.600" style="s2">that&#39;s making right so sacrifices is</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.560" end="01:29:41.600" style="s2">another kind of making</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.480" end="01:29:47.120" style="s2">yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.719" end="01:29:53.040" style="s2">well i guess i&#39;m just curious what</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.679" end="01:29:54.800" style="s2">what&#39;s the distinction between making</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.040" end="01:29:57.840" style="s2">and causing</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.800" end="01:30:00.560" style="s2">well what i presume you&#39;re saying make</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.840" end="01:30:01.920" style="s2">sacred from like did i tell you that it</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.560" end="01:30:04.560" style="s2">means that or did you</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.920" end="01:30:05.040" style="s2">find that yourself no i think you told</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.560" end="01:30:08.080" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.040" end="01:30:11.600" style="s2">yeah um when i say make sacred i meant</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.080" end="01:30:13.760" style="s2">like cause to be sacred like i make</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.600" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s i meant that in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.760" end="01:30:17.440" style="s2">in the english word of make</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.679" end="01:30:23.679" style="s2">like cause to be your cause too</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.120" end="01:30:27.360" style="s2">yeah like like a maker like if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.679" end="01:30:29.520" style="s2">produce the thing you literally made it</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.360" end="01:30:30.400" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s like i i&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.520" end="01:30:33.199" style="s2">something sacred</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.400" end="01:30:34.239" style="s2">i caused it to be sacred i caused it to</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.199" end="01:30:38.719" style="s2">have a certain</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.239" end="01:30:40.880" style="s2">trait right but like</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.719" end="01:30:42.400" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to say is ultimately if</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.880" end="01:30:44.080" style="s2">you go back to the oldest ideas of</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.400" end="01:30:45.920" style="s2">sacrifice right it&#39;s always a death but</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.080" end="01:30:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a death that serves life</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.920" end="01:30:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s you you kill the thing in</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.560" end="01:30:54.159" style="s2">such a way that it that it actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.320" end="01:30:57.440" style="s2">makes it serve life and so it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.159" end="01:31:01.280" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.440" end="01:31:04.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the i don&#39;t know really how to</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.280" end="01:31:06.239" style="s2">like it it&#39;s a way to to</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.480" end="01:31:08.960" style="s2">basically deal with death in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.239" end="01:31:10.880" style="s2">that subverts it i guess</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.960" end="01:31:13.280" style="s2">and that that was the i like the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.880" end="01:31:16.880" style="s2">idol the the idea of sacredness was</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.280" end="01:31:20.719" style="s2">was the was to was to recover the hole</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.880" end="01:31:22.639" style="s2">with you know like to heal and so you</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.719" end="01:31:24.080" style="s2">the the sacrifice is the death that</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.639" end="01:31:25.760" style="s2">allows you to heal</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.080" end="01:31:27.679" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.760" end="01:31:28.880" style="s2">weird kind of a paradox but surprise i</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.679" end="01:31:31.040" style="s2">can tell that that was</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.880" end="01:31:32.400" style="s2">sort of the idea behind it and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.040" end="01:31:35.679" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.400" end="01:31:38.080" style="s2">destruction in the name of creation</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.679" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">right but then so you you you make the</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.080" end="01:31:41.920" style="s2">creation through the destruction right</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s what you&#39;re producing</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.920" end="01:31:48.000" style="s2">and so the idea of a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.400" end="01:31:49.040" style="s2">um to what sesame</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.000" end="01:31:50.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i&#39;m probably not</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.040" end="01:31:52.159" style="s2">pronouncing that for wrong but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.480" end="01:31:55.199" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.159" end="01:31:56.960" style="s2">what he said you know about the the the</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.199" end="01:31:59.280" style="s2">the thing having to be productive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.960" end="01:32:00.800" style="s2">like if you&#39;re just sacrificing for no</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.280" end="01:32:02.320" style="s2">reason whatsoever that doesn&#39;t serve the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.800" end="01:32:04.880" style="s2">purpose of use</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.320" end="01:32:05.760" style="s2">the question is like when is it actually</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.880" end="01:32:08.560" style="s2">you know like</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.760" end="01:32:11.040" style="s2">when is it a good idea to kill yourself</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.560" end="01:32:12.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the the the whole idea about</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.040" end="01:32:14.159" style="s2">sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.080" end="01:32:15.199" style="s2">is an attempt to actually answer that</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.159" end="01:32:17.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.199" end="01:32:19.840" style="s2">and it is something that you know like a</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.040" end="01:32:20.159" style="s2">human presumably would want to know what</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.840" end="01:32:24.000" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.159" end="01:32:24.400" style="s2">is worth dying at least in principle i</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.000" end="01:32:25.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.400" end="01:32:27.520" style="s2">maybe somebody thinks well that thing is</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.920" end="01:32:28.400" style="s2">worth dying for i don&#39;t know but i think</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.520" end="01:32:30.639" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.400" end="01:32:32.800" style="s2">like if you i don&#39;t think you&#39;ve fully</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.639" end="01:32:33.840" style="s2">come to terms with your mortality if</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.800" end="01:32:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.840" end="01:32:37.840" style="s2">on the list that you aren&#39;t willing to</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.440" end="01:32:37.840" style="s2">die for</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.199" end="01:32:44.480" style="s2">i also wanted to disagree with the idea</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.840" end="01:32:48.159" style="s2">that we just don&#39;t understand the hero</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.480" end="01:32:51.280" style="s2">i mean like maybe that&#39;s true of many</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.159" end="01:32:53.440" style="s2">hero stories but uh sort of defeats</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.280" end="01:32:55.520" style="s2">the point of having the hero story if</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.440" end="01:32:56.159" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually know what makes them</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.520" end="01:32:59.440" style="s2">a hero</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.159" end="01:33:01.360" style="s2">so no to to well</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.440" end="01:33:03.120" style="s2">yes and no the issue is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.360" end="01:33:05.199" style="s2">don&#39;t say anything about the hero then</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.120" end="01:33:06.719" style="s2">any then everybody can sympathize they</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.199" end="01:33:08.320" style="s2">can put themselves in the hero&#39;s shoes</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.719" end="01:33:09.280" style="s2">because the absence of details just</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.320" end="01:33:12.159" style="s2">allows them to place</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.280" end="01:33:13.600" style="s2">themselves in the hero so that&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.159" end="01:33:15.440" style="s2">a it&#39;s a narrative trick</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.600" end="01:33:17.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to create a a character</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.440" end="01:33:18.320" style="s2">or a hero that everybody can relate to</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.040" end="01:33:20.639" style="s2">that&#39;s a great way of doing it</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.320" end="01:33:21.600" style="s2">like harry potter is a very strong</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.639" end="01:33:24.880" style="s2">example like</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.600" end="01:33:26.639" style="s2">he&#39;s almost featureless but he</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.880" end="01:33:28.159" style="s2">but he like except he&#39;s the boy who</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.639" end="01:33:29.920" style="s2">lived but like everything about him</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.159" end="01:33:32.000" style="s2">like he&#39;s a very silent character he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.920" end="01:33:34.000" style="s2">not like ron or hermione</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.000" end="01:33:36.719" style="s2">which are you know their characters are</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.000" end="01:33:38.320" style="s2">very very well defined</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.719" end="01:33:40.239" style="s2">so there isn&#39;t elements of truth to that</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.320" end="01:33:40.800" style="s2">but i agree with you i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.239" end="01:33:44.000" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.800" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">if you really uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.000" end="01:33:47.920" style="s2">describing hero who&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:50.239" style="s2">succeed and is supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.920" end="01:33:51.679" style="s2">tell people something useful about life</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.239" end="01:33:52.719" style="s2">then you&#39;ll need to shade in all of</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.679" end="01:33:54.000" style="s2">those details</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.719" end="01:33:56.159" style="s2">like it&#39;s not going to work any other</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.000" end="01:33:56.159" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.000" end="01:34:08.480" style="s2">do you think brad weinstein is a hero</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.880" end="01:34:11.040" style="s2">uh he sacrificed</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.480" end="01:34:13.840" style="s2">he championed he was productive and he</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.040" end="01:34:13.840" style="s2">is mysterious</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.000" end="01:34:18.480" style="s2">well he certainly has has heroism about</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.840" end="01:34:19.920" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.480" end="01:34:22.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a hero if he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.920" end="01:34:24.159" style="s2">martyr but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.080" end="01:34:26.080" style="s2">seems more like a martyr to me i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.159" end="01:34:28.320" style="s2">sure i&#39;m sold on that particular set of</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.080" end="01:34:31.520" style="s2">features of heroes so</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.320" end="01:34:31.520" style="s2">martyr has to be killed</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.080" end="01:34:47.199" style="s2">you&#39;re taking the sacrifice thing all</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.760" end="01:34:49.280" style="s2">the way to the end when you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.199" end="01:34:50.639" style="s2">need to we sacrifice all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.280" end="01:34:52.400" style="s2">all the time and different heroes</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.639" end="01:34:53.600" style="s2">sacrifice different things that actually</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.400" end="01:34:56.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t there live</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.600" end="01:34:58.840" style="s2">and it worked out fine so</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.880" end="01:35:01.520" style="s2">yeah i mean i understand going to the</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.840" end="01:35:03.679" style="s2">extremes specialty of mine but in this</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.520" end="01:35:05.840" style="s2">case it&#39;s probably maladaptive</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.679" end="01:35:07.119" style="s2">he obtained like 10 years salary from</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.840" end="01:35:10.080" style="s2">that what</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.119" end="01:35:10.080" style="s2">what did he martyr</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.800" end="01:35:14.400" style="s2">losing his job was the best thing that</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.480" end="01:35:17.440" style="s2">could have happened to him i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.400" end="01:35:18.159" style="s2">the no no no no no first of all trading</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.440" end="01:35:20.239" style="s2">cash</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.159" end="01:35:22.400" style="s2">for something like a pension or a stable</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.239" end="01:35:24.480" style="s2">job is the dumbest thing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.400" end="01:35:26.639" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s just pig ignore to take cash</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.480" end="01:35:28.880" style="s2">over even much more cash</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.639" end="01:35:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;s stupid right that&#39;s that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.880" end="01:35:31.920" style="s2">people go bankrupt because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.159" end="01:35:35.040" style="s2">understand the value of having</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.920" end="01:35:39.199" style="s2">income over having capital today</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.040" end="01:35:39.920" style="s2">right so yeah he lost a very good job</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.199" end="01:35:41.440" style="s2">that he liked</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.920" end="01:35:44.560" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t get to do what he most</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.440" end="01:35:44.560" style="s2">liked in the world</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.199" end="01:35:48.719" style="s2">i would say it&#39;s almost certain that</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.880" end="01:35:51.840" style="s2">some people will hear a worship</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.719" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">the kind of person that brett is</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.840" end="01:35:57.840" style="s2">but i would not consider him a hero</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.080" end="01:36:00.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting because he hits</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.440" end="01:36:02.000" style="s2">all the points that you guys are</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.960" end="01:36:03.920" style="s2">touching on</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.000" end="01:36:06.080" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very interesting to me when i</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.920" end="01:36:08.560" style="s2">talk to people on these servers how</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.080" end="01:36:09.760" style="s2">how they&#39;re able to classify somebody</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.560" end="01:36:10.719" style="s2">they&#39;re able to kind of paint this</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.760" end="01:36:13.840" style="s2">picture</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.719" end="01:36:17.440" style="s2">right and then i provide an example that</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.840" end="01:36:19.600" style="s2">fits that picture and no no not that guy</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.440" end="01:36:20.719" style="s2">but we just don&#39;t like him right and</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.600" end="01:36:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.719" end="01:36:24.800" style="s2">it it&#39;s interesting i just i disagree</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.040" end="01:36:25.840" style="s2">with these values so therefore i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.800" end="01:36:27.679" style="s2">really consider it</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.840" end="01:36:29.280" style="s2">like i&#39;m not sure that he sacrificed</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.679" end="01:36:31.199" style="s2">himself for the right things and so</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.280" end="01:36:34.320" style="s2">therefore i&#39;m critical of it</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.199" end="01:36:34.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter how he ended up in in</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.320" end="01:36:36.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.960" end="01:36:38.000" style="s2">in the grand scheme of things with</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.320" end="01:36:41.040" style="s2">respect to how wealthy is and everything</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.000" end="01:36:43.679" style="s2">like uh if if you&#39;re asking me</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.040" end="01:36:44.480" style="s2">did he uh did he succeed financially</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.679" end="01:36:47.360" style="s2">through what he did</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.480" end="01:36:48.400" style="s2">yes but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.360" end="01:36:50.159" style="s2">that has to</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.400" end="01:36:52.400" style="s2">what that has to do with his heroism per</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.159" end="01:36:55.840" style="s2">se and like</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.400" end="01:36:59.199" style="s2">he&#39;s provided leadership to many</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.840" end="01:37:00.639" style="s2">young men and women who are seeking</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.199" end="01:37:05.199" style="s2">roles in science</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.639" end="01:37:07.520" style="s2">are entering academia his story has been</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.199" end="01:37:08.239" style="s2">dispute that i i fully acknowledge it</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.520" end="01:37:10.560" style="s2">but i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.239" end="01:37:12.159" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that that particular role</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.560" end="01:37:14.480" style="s2">that he&#39;s trying to play</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.159" end="01:37:16.159" style="s2">is a let&#39;s call it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.480" end="01:37:19.119" style="s2">evolutionarily adapted</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.159" end="01:37:22.320" style="s2">opinion so i&#39;m suspicious of it so your</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.119" end="01:37:24.880" style="s2">hero has to also be perfect then</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.320" end="01:37:27.040" style="s2">nobody said anything about him and we</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.880" end="01:37:27.679" style="s2">also weren&#39;t trying to explain what made</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.040" end="01:37:29.760" style="s2">a hero</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.679" end="01:37:31.440" style="s2">and what did right we did we never we</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.760" end="01:37:32.840" style="s2">never settled on that definition</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.440" end="01:37:34.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know why you&#39;re making that</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.840" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">characterization</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.480" end="01:37:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s conversation</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.080" end="01:37:44.960" style="s2">i haven&#39;t unless it&#39;s not sorry</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.440" end="01:37:47.199" style="s2">can you hear me right now yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.960" end="01:37:48.480" style="s2">i have a question what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.199" end="01:37:52.320" style="s2">between an alchemist</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.480" end="01:37:57.199" style="s2">hero earlier oh</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.320" end="01:38:00.000" style="s2">ability um transcending suffering</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.199" end="01:38:00.000" style="s2">feedback loop</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.320" end="01:38:08.400" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re cutting out a little bit so</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.440" end="01:38:08.400" style="s2">oh sending suffering</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.760" end="01:38:17.119" style="s2">now you&#39;re cutting somebody&#39;s cutting</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.080" end="01:38:29.440" style="s2">all i heard was alchemist and in terms</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.400" end="01:38:32.000" style="s2">of heroism</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.440" end="01:38:32.880" style="s2">i can see that like an alchemist is</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.000" end="01:38:35.040" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.880" end="01:38:37.280" style="s2">like a transformative individual so</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.040" end="01:38:39.520" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.280" end="01:38:41.600" style="s2">aspect of heroism to them at least</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.520" end="01:38:44.719" style="s2">conceptually like that that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.600" end="01:38:45.920" style="s2">i think at least some people try to</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.719" end="01:38:48.400" style="s2">describe alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.920" end="01:38:49.520" style="s2">heroes in in terms of their personal</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.400" end="01:38:52.480" style="s2">spiritual journeys</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.520" end="01:38:53.920" style="s2">like that that was the or at least the</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.480" end="01:38:55.920" style="s2">magician within alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.920" end="01:38:57.679" style="s2">like well you know the alchemist in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.920" end="01:39:01.679" style="s2">magicians like</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.679" end="01:39:05.040" style="s2">almost the same thing but um the the</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.679" end="01:39:06.800" style="s2">personal well somebody would</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.040" end="01:39:07.840" style="s2">at least in theory you know there was</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.800" end="01:39:09.600" style="s2">like the idea that they would be</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.840" end="01:39:12.080" style="s2">initiated by another alchemist</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.600" end="01:39:13.600" style="s2">or or the writings of another outcome</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.080" end="01:39:15.199" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll go on their own</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.600" end="01:39:17.280" style="s2">their own journey because of it but like</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.199" end="01:39:19.520" style="s2">the the whole thing does have a a</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.280" end="01:39:20.400" style="s2">heroic kind of romantic streak about</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.520" end="01:39:22.800" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.400" end="01:39:24.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that speaks to what um</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.800" end="01:39:26.320" style="s2">lynn was trying to say or not but</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.719" end="01:39:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what i could the sense that i</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.320" end="01:39:28.880" style="s2">could get from</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.119" end="01:39:35.280" style="s2">i just just wanted to we&#39;ve got like 20</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.520" end="01:39:36.560" style="s2">minutes before i finish the recording so</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.280" end="01:39:39.040" style="s2">i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.560" end="01:39:40.639" style="s2">does anyone did is anyone else here</p>

<p begin="01:39:40.639" end="01:39:44.320" style="s2">three that have basically talked the</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.320" end="01:39:48.080" style="s2">entire time got any uh</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.320" end="01:39:55.840" style="s2">notes that they&#39;re busting to express or</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.080" end="01:39:55.840" style="s2">thoughts on what&#39;s been said so far</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.239" end="01:40:04.480" style="s2">hey guys i&#39;ve been listening for a while</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.840" end="01:40:12.400" style="s2">uh a lot of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.679" end="01:40:12.400" style="s2">a lot of thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.760" end="01:40:18.480" style="s2">trying to determine if they should just</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.400" end="01:40:20.159" style="s2">remain as thoughts and trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.480" end="01:40:25.360" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.159" end="01:40:25.360" style="s2">what to be said um</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.440" end="01:40:30.800" style="s2">let me do one thing</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.840" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">just to go back to the initial point of</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.840" end="01:40:37.840" style="s2">the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.360" end="01:40:46.080" style="s2">a religion that&#39;s not a religion and i</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.800" end="01:40:50.159" style="s2">definitely attracted to that the more i</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.080" end="01:40:54.480" style="s2">do these practices</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.159" end="01:40:58.239" style="s2">the meditation the yoga the reading</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.480" end="01:41:00.960" style="s2">the the being the the doing of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.239" end="01:41:00.960" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.119" end="01:41:09.360" style="s2">that&#39;s imbued with such</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.159" end="01:41:12.960" style="s2">history and</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.360" end="01:41:15.679" style="s2">connects me to this intense</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.960" end="01:41:17.119" style="s2">ancient it just connects me to my</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.679" end="01:41:19.600" style="s2">ancestors in some way</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.119" end="01:41:23.040" style="s2">it connects me with my humanity</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.600" end="01:41:23.040" style="s2">transcends my identity</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.880" end="01:41:32.880" style="s2">and allows me to deep</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.119" end="01:41:38.159" style="s2">like to reach into some capacity for</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.880" end="01:41:42.239" style="s2">for some kind of self-actualization</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.159" end="01:41:42.239" style="s2">it seems like such a good process</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.400" end="01:41:46.000" style="s2">and then you know i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.199" end="01:41:47.440" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.000" end="01:41:49.199" style="s2">discussions about the religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.440" end="01:41:52.320" style="s2">not a religion</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.199" end="01:41:56.000" style="s2">but the mode of communication and the</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.320" end="01:41:59.360" style="s2">process of</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.000" end="01:42:02.719" style="s2">development just hinges on</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.360" end="01:42:06.960" style="s2">these structures that i perceive</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.719" end="01:42:08.560" style="s2">as well worn out</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.960" end="01:42:10.239" style="s2">inevitably the conversation turns to</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.560" end="01:42:13.360" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.239" end="01:42:14.880" style="s2">organization self-organization some form</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.360" end="01:42:18.320" style="s2">of auditing</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.880" end="01:42:21.440" style="s2">um project management you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.320" end="01:42:21.440" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.639" end="01:42:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just interesting how uh like i i</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.840" end="01:42:29.520" style="s2">don&#39;t doubt that there&#39;s gonna be some</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.440" end="01:42:32.560" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.520" end="01:42:35.840" style="s2">and things to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.560" end="01:42:38.080" style="s2">mined in that direction but what i think</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.840" end="01:42:40.840" style="s2">i also heard at the beginning was that</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.080" end="01:42:42.880" style="s2">the the practice the dialogues the</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.840" end="01:42:47.520" style="s2">philosophia</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.880" end="01:42:51.360" style="s2">is really perhaps the heart of the way</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.520" end="01:42:54.239" style="s2">into a great synthesis of</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.360" end="01:42:54.239" style="s2">what matters and</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.199" end="01:43:01.440" style="s2">despite the heart of you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.320" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">despite the fact that usually</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.440" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">the heart of these practices is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.600" end="01:43:12.719" style="s2">delving into this unknowingness this uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.040" end="01:43:17.040" style="s2">this inability to</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.719" end="01:43:17.040" style="s2">to resolve matters</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.159" end="01:43:24.560" style="s2">so i guess</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.520" end="01:43:27.040" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what i have to say i</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.560" end="01:43:28.560" style="s2">appreciate all you guys that i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.040" end="01:43:30.159" style="s2">getting to know the server more and more</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.560" end="01:43:35.679" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.159" end="01:43:35.679" style="s2">uh yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.920" end="01:43:40.159" style="s2">well hi and welcome hope you enjoy your</p>

<p begin="01:43:43.440" end="01:43:47.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;ll continue to be a space for</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.760" end="01:43:54.320" style="s2">for open dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.199" end="01:44:07.600" style="s2">and a good faith of</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.320" end="01:44:09.119" style="s2">the of this course in practice</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.600" end="01:44:11.520" style="s2">i think you can call it velocity and i</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.119" end="01:44:12.719" style="s2">don&#39;t think that the last 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.520" end="01:44:18.320" style="s2">yeah i was thinking at least not in</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.719" end="01:44:18.320" style="s2">terms of recording all right</p>
