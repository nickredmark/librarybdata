<p begin="00:00:02.790" end="00:00:08.730" style="s2">search I&#39;d really stated plus it synced</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.040" end="00:00:11.250" style="s2">Lee is that time the advancing threats</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.730" end="00:00:14.309" style="s2">to humanity outpace the intensity scale</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.250" end="00:00:18.470" style="s2">a behavioral response so what do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.309" end="00:00:22.020" style="s2">by that what I mean is that we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.470" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">melting ice sheets in the Arctic we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">a destabilized financial system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:30.390" style="s2">causing widespread hardship all right we</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:34.380" style="s2">have natural disasters flooding tsunamis</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.390" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">earthquakes volcanoes tornadoes all</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.380" end="00:00:38.010" style="s2">these things that are happening around</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:40.670" style="s2">us that are making it hard for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.010" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">live our lives then we have these really</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.670" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">weird problems of abundance and scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:48.840" style="s2">some people have incredible wealth and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">yet so many people don&#39;t have enough and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.840" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">at the same time we&#39;re in the midst we</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">paid where we no longer have an</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">abundance of natural resources we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.129" style="s2">running out of oil we&#39;re running out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">precious metals we&#39;re running out of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.129" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">potable water and so so in this period</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:06.150" style="s2">we&#39;re all these really big things is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:07.710" style="s2">kind of cluster of threats that created</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.150" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">this huge existential quandary for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:13.670" style="s2">humanity and our behavioral response is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">not happening big enough or fast enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.670" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">to respond to that change and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:22.890" style="s2">we&#39;re here today is to start to really</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">address that big picture so to help give</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.890" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">this a little bit of a temporal context</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s look this is mostly us</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:30.540" style="s2">cultural history but I think it maps</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:33.060" style="s2">onto the world fairly wells there was</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.540" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">this time back in the 60s when it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.060" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">like things might be going a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">differently there was a lot of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">of consciousness for people they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">talking about peace instead of war</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">bringing down Empire they were talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">about love and compassion and then we</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:49.320" style="s2">had you know some people in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:51.740" style="s2">political space some leaders who were</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">starting to advance a more progressive</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.740" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">notion of the world that young e EPA was</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:58.740" style="s2">created we have these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:02.780" style="s2">starting to get set up looks like we</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.740" end="00:02:02.780" style="s2">might be making progress and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.900" end="00:02:09.030" style="s2">what happened then we had this turnover</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">where the culture started to shift in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.030" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">different direction and we starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">have people who were opposed very</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:18.690" style="s2">structurally strategically almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">militaristic alee opposed to this kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.690" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">of a shift in the culture and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:25.020" style="s2">reversed it in some ways they took us to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:27.390" style="s2">another place and we had this</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.020" end="00:02:29.190" style="s2">progression of political leaders and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.390" end="00:02:30.810" style="s2">business leaders who are taking us</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.190" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">somewhere other than addressing the deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">threats that that sixties generation was</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.650" style="s2">really starting to shed light on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:40.200" style="s2">yell and that&#39;s led us to a point where</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.650" end="00:02:43.740" style="s2">now we have this huge pics of problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.200" end="00:02:45.930" style="s2">and we&#39;re not responding to them on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.740" end="00:02:49.770" style="s2">appropriate scale and you know sure we</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.930" end="00:02:51.180" style="s2">have this networked world that is being</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.770" end="00:02:52.860" style="s2">created there create some new</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">possibilities for us but we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.860" end="00:02:58.500" style="s2">unleashed the power and potential of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:01.110" style="s2">creativity to turn the culture back in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.500" end="00:03:02.520" style="s2">the right direction again and I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">there are a lot of things moving us in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.520" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">that direction but that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">trying to do is in our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">today is talk about how do we get that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">big cultural shift consciousness shift</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">realignment of norms and values</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.319" end="00:03:21.049" style="s2">so what didn&#39;t we see when we started</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.799" end="00:03:22.730" style="s2">this March at toward progress 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.049" end="00:03:25.400" style="s2">ago but we didn&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.730" end="00:03:28.069" style="s2">corporatization of America we didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.400" end="00:03:30.579" style="s2">how powerful that would be we didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.069" end="00:03:33.469" style="s2">that there would be these incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.579" end="00:03:35.299" style="s2">powerful propaganda communication</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.469" end="00:03:37.310" style="s2">systems I would set a specific agenda</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.299" end="00:03:39.409" style="s2">and largely influenced the way people</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.310" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">see the world then we didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.409" end="00:03:43.939" style="s2">astroturf thing and sophisticated ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:46.639" style="s2">of engaging people around real concerns</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.939" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">with fictitious threats to mobilize them</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.639" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">against change all of that has happened</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s something else we didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:58.790" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t see this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:04:01.250" style="s2">investment in an infrastructure for</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.790" end="00:04:03.620" style="s2">opposing what we&#39;re trying to do now</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.250" end="00:04:06.919" style="s2">this network map right here shows</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.620" end="00:04:08.900" style="s2">basically two colors the blue is all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.919" end="00:04:10.730" style="s2">the liberal think tanks in the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.900" end="00:04:12.500" style="s2">States and the red is all the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:16.099" style="s2">conservative think tanks in the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.500" end="00:04:17.750" style="s2">States as of a few years ago in 2006 is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.099" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">when they made this so what this shows</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.750" end="00:04:23.479" style="s2">is that over the last 40 to 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:25.820" style="s2">there has been a strategic substantive</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.479" end="00:04:28.570" style="s2">very large investment in a communication</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.820" end="00:04:31.070" style="s2">system that is directly opposed to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.570" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">that is directly opposed to equality</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.070" end="00:04:38.750" style="s2">fairness justice sustainability and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:41.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you know we just were men</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.750" end="00:04:43.159" style="s2">of moving along and we made some</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.330" end="00:04:44.840" style="s2">mistakes we actually had some forces</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.159" end="00:04:46.070" style="s2">pushing very strongly against us and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.840" end="00:04:48.380" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to be able to push</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.070" end="00:04:51.949" style="s2">back against them effectively as we move</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.380" end="00:04:56.500" style="s2">forward so this gets back to that big</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.949" end="00:05:00.139" style="s2">question how do we design for</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.500" end="00:05:02.599" style="s2">large-scale change it turns out the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.139" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">ancient mystics and the wisdom of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.599" end="00:05:08.300" style="s2">ages has an answer for us the answer</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:10.520" style="s2">lies within turns out they were right</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.300" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">that&#39;s true the answer lies within by</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.520" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">which I mean that if we understand what</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">it means to be human we can use that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:20.360" style="s2">understanding to design change processes</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:22.370" style="s2">that actually appeal to humans and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.360" end="00:05:24.590" style="s2">help create change that creates thriving</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.370" end="00:05:27.920" style="s2">in human community so if we look within</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.590" end="00:05:30.080" style="s2">ourselves we can reveal that blind spot</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.920" end="00:05:33.230" style="s2">we can see what&#39;s there and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:34.790" style="s2">design for change more effectively so</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.230" end="00:05:36.650" style="s2">one of the big problems that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.790" end="00:05:39.020" style="s2">in designing for change is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.650" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">had this what I call an assumed human</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.020" end="00:05:43.610" style="s2">nature which is this idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:45.470" style="s2">calculating machines who weigh the pros</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.610" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">and cons and every choice try and get</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.470" end="00:05:50.030" style="s2">the maximal outcome just like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:52.760" style="s2">calculators now this is a nice theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.030" end="00:05:56.180" style="s2">for mathematicians looking at economics</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.760" end="00:05:57.950" style="s2">back in the 1940s but I like to call the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:00.590" style="s2">assumed theory of human nature because</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.950" end="00:06:01.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not really how we work the way the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.590" end="00:06:05.540" style="s2">human beings work is something a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.790" end="00:06:06.770" style="s2">different so really exciting thing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.540" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">this is something that inspires me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.770" end="00:06:12.920" style="s2">is for the first time ever in human</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.190" end="00:06:15.920" style="s2">history we now are starting to really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.920" end="00:06:17.090" style="s2">understand what human nature is so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.920" end="00:06:19.570" style="s2">the last 40 years there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.090" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">revolution happening in academia</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.570" end="00:06:23.810" style="s2">studying how the mind works and what</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.820" style="s2">human nature is it comes from fields</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.810" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">like evolutionary psychology we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.000" end="00:07:00.320" style="s2">quite an accomplishment for us so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.640" end="00:07:01.910" style="s2">we&#39;re learning about what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.320" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">human is what&#39;s sometimes called the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:06.440" style="s2">embodied mind and the embodied mind is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:08.780" style="s2">notion that the way that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.440" end="00:07:10.820" style="s2">work is partially a matter of our</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.780" end="00:07:13.640" style="s2">ecological history or physical and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.820" end="00:07:16.100" style="s2">biological nature the cultural as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.640" end="00:07:18.770" style="s2">as both environments around us that all</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.100" end="00:07:20.330" style="s2">shape who we are and how we work so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.770" end="00:07:21.950" style="s2">like to think of it as the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.330" end="00:07:23.660" style="s2">brains we have the kinds of bodies we</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.950" end="00:07:25.910" style="s2">have and the kinds of environments we</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.660" end="00:07:27.980" style="s2">find ourselves in both physical and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.910" end="00:07:30.230" style="s2">cultural shape the kinds of minds that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.980" end="00:07:32.300" style="s2">we have at the same time we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.230" end="00:07:33.530" style="s2">things like we&#39;re wired for empathy that</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.300" end="00:07:35.600" style="s2">we have really powerful ways of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.530" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">believing things about the world rather</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.600" end="00:07:38.630" style="s2">than simply reasoning about them but at</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:41.150" style="s2">the same time we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.630" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">credible capacity for reason and logic</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.150" end="00:07:46.520" style="s2">so we have this these aspects of who we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:47.660" style="s2">are that are really interesting there</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.520" end="00:07:49.730" style="s2">are a lot more than just being a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.660" end="00:07:51.950" style="s2">calculator for us to have a tribal</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.730" end="00:07:54.200" style="s2">nature of this way of wanting to be in</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.950" end="00:07:56.140" style="s2">group with others so these things that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.200" end="00:07:58.490" style="s2">we&#39;re learning about how we work and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.140" end="00:08:00.350" style="s2">there I think of them as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.490" end="00:08:01.670" style="s2">liberating they&#39;re empowering if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.350" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">understand what it means to be tribal</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.670" end="00:08:06.110" style="s2">yes that can be divisive and make people</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:07.640" style="s2">into different groups but it can also</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.110" end="00:08:10.040" style="s2">mean that we can be inclusive and we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.640" end="00:08:13.010" style="s2">work together and collaborate so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.040" end="00:08:15.020" style="s2">part of who we are so Scott idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.010" end="00:08:16.730" style="s2">embodiment is really important and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.020" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">everything that we talked about today of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.730" end="00:08:20.210" style="s2">regarding the mind it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:22.190" style="s2">keep in mind that we can ground it back</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.210" end="00:08:25.100" style="s2">in our brains and our bodies and our</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.190" end="00:08:27.050" style="s2">communities it&#39;s not just this abstract</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.100" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">the mind is out there doing its thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.050" end="00:08:30.880" style="s2">it&#39;s embedded its ecological</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.009" end="00:08:35.180" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty cool and and to give</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:36.409" style="s2">you a sense of what I mean let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.180" end="00:08:38.089" style="s2">through a couple examples of some things</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.409" end="00:08:39.620" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been learning about the mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.089" end="00:08:42.019" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever gotten</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.620" end="00:08:44.449" style="s2">this email I loved it when I first got</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.019" end="00:08:47.050" style="s2">it but you know if you can read English</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.449" end="00:08:50.570" style="s2">you can make sense of this paragraph</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.050" end="00:08:52.730" style="s2">even though the letters within the words</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.570" end="00:08:53.990" style="s2">are all mixed up and it sells is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.730" end="00:08:56.480" style="s2">something really important about how our</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.990" end="00:08:59.510" style="s2">minds work it tells us that our minds</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.480" end="00:09:02.029" style="s2">are set up to see patterns in the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.510" end="00:09:04.490" style="s2">that are familiar to us and to fill in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.029" end="00:09:05.750" style="s2">information in a way that helps us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.490" end="00:09:08.660" style="s2">understand what&#39;s happening in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.750" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">situations so my ability to process</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.660" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">language lets me see the kind of Gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:15.470" style="s2">or the bigger pattern of the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:17.149" style="s2">structure through the word the words in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.470" end="00:09:18.949" style="s2">the spacing in the words and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.149" end="00:09:22.069" style="s2">able to make sense of it and my brain is</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.949" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">filling in that information for me and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.069" end="00:09:25.399" style="s2">kind of get it for free I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:27.829" style="s2">do any act of work my brain just does it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.399" end="00:09:31.029" style="s2">so our brains do this pattern matching</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.829" end="00:09:35.060" style="s2">process just really useful to know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.029" end="00:09:39.319" style="s2">another one you know i should say i love</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.060" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">animals i really love elephants and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.319" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">especially love levitating elephants if</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:47.149" style="s2">you look at this optical illusion you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:49.550" style="s2">see that the legs actually don&#39;t connect</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.149" end="00:09:50.779" style="s2">to the body and and yours it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.550" end="00:09:52.790" style="s2">fun little thing but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.779" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">this tells us is that our brains don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:09:57.139" style="s2">just do pattern matching they also do</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:58.819" style="s2">pattern completion they will fill in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.139" end="00:10:00.500" style="s2">patterns but they don&#39;t just fill them</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.819" end="00:10:03.410" style="s2">in in any old way they fill them in in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.500" end="00:10:05.420" style="s2">way that makes things meaningful they</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.410" end="00:10:06.589" style="s2">create these Gestalt understandings so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.420" end="00:10:08.089" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.589" end="00:10:09.920" style="s2">elephant your brain is trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.089" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">the legs attached when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.920" end="00:10:14.510" style="s2">the bottom of the elephant it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">to shift the body over onto the legs so</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.510" end="00:10:18.199" style="s2">your brain is completing the information</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:22.130" style="s2">for you in ways that are meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.199" end="00:10:23.750" style="s2">useful and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not just that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.130" end="00:10:26.690" style="s2">see the world as it is we see the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:29.300" style="s2">as it is meaningful to us and that our</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.690" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2">brains just do this for us which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.300" end="00:10:33.800" style="s2">pretty cool now this is another one you</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.600" end="00:10:35.149" style="s2">might have seen you know if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.800" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">the black part it looks like a vase if</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.149" end="00:10:38.360" style="s2">you look at the white part it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:39.769" style="s2">faces this actually tells us something</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.360" end="00:10:41.690" style="s2">incredibly important about how our</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.769" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">brains work</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.690" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">this is phenomenon called mutual</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">inhibition what that is is when your</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:49.520" style="s2">brain is creating a pattern which is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:51.260" style="s2">know the neurons are firing into this</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.520" end="00:10:53.090" style="s2">pattern structure which is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.260" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">information that represents the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.090" end="00:10:56.540" style="s2">when it&#39;s forming that pattern if</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:10:58.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a different pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.540" end="00:11:00.590" style="s2">contradicts it that makes it confusing</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.580" end="00:11:03.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a part of your brain that shuts</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.590" end="00:11:05.480" style="s2">down those circuits that&#39;s called mutual</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.620" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">inhibition for one circuit to be active</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.480" end="00:11:09.890" style="s2">the other must be inhibited now to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:11.240" style="s2">really understand this with example</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:13.880" style="s2">think about what happens when a person</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.240" end="00:11:15.560" style="s2">is having an epileptic seizure their</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.880" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">brain is just having random firing all</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.560" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">over the place and what it does it shuts</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:21.740" style="s2">down consciousness and they pass out so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:23.120" style="s2">I tells us is that our brains need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.740" end="00:11:25.190" style="s2">have the ability to regulate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.120" end="00:11:27.050" style="s2">to create coherence and to do that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.190" end="00:11:35.840" style="s2">have to inhabit one idea to create</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.840" end="00:11:40.250" style="s2">would maybe there&#39;s a higher level</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:41.720" style="s2">phenomenon that includes this for there</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.250" end="00:11:44.210" style="s2">to be cognitive dissonance you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.720" end="00:11:45.830" style="s2">have two ideas that are kind of battling</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.210" end="00:11:47.900" style="s2">it out for which one is going to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.830" end="00:11:51.020" style="s2">dominance but that process of mutual in</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.900" end="00:11:52.250" style="s2">addition is why that happens and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.020" end="00:11:53.840" style="s2">it&#39;s helpful to think about it from an</p>
