<p begin="00:00:00.960" end="00:00:05.970" style="s2">and I sense it too in you and your sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.060" end="00:00:07.830" style="s2">of compassion and what what you walk</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.970" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">with I would imagine in ways that are so</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.830" end="00:00:11.940" style="s2">implicit to you you don&#39;t even notice it</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:13.410" style="s2">but it really does stand out and I just</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.940" end="00:00:16.850" style="s2">want to let you know I really have</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.410" end="00:00:20.670" style="s2">appreciated your your continuous</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.850" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">compassion and like your the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.670" end="00:00:28.529" style="s2">the courage to completely explore in all</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.570" style="s2">these conversations that I think like</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.529" end="00:00:33.570" style="s2">would look like would look threatening</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.570" end="00:00:38.540" style="s2">to explore I think to many but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.570" end="00:00:38.540" style="s2">like you keep turning towards it and are</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.870" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">open open to it well again thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.750" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s very kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">you know I it&#39;s I mean that we&#39;re home</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">you know and and what else you said the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t produce history I</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">think in some ways that I mean both</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:00:58.850" style="s2">those concepts swing back into marriage</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">where we started this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.850" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">because in in a sense in a sense what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:11.840" style="s2">do when we marry is we express an</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">aspirational agency towards creating</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.840" end="00:01:19.259" style="s2">creating home and you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">obviously the context in which in which</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.259" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">children come into this world you want</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">your you very much want your child to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">have a sense of have a sense of home</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.299" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">and and and again you know we we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">produce history but there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">interesting relationship between that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">and home you know toll Keane obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:47.700" style="s2">and his you know in the hobbit when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">know Bilbo Tolkien on one hand very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.700" end="00:01:54.030" style="s2">as the hobbit hole is home yeah and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:59.869" style="s2">Bilbo must leave home yes no there and</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:12.730" style="s2">one of the things so you know I I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.210" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">a lot about we have this we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.730" end="00:02:18.069" style="s2">obviously have this longing for home</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">this is deeply built into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.069" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">church church language we have a you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">know home is identified with with you</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:55.630" style="s2">they had a sense that that you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.130" end="00:02:58.030" style="s2">help them and he even look at these</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">spatial metaphors we&#39;re using at a sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.030" end="00:03:03.549" style="s2">that that you could help them find home</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:08.470" style="s2">even though they&#39;re you know clearly</p>

<p begin="00:03:13.660" end="00:03:19.930" style="s2">home is while all of us would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:23.799" style="s2">hard-pressed we might be able to offer</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.930" end="00:03:26.049" style="s2">up some adjectives that are evocative we</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.799" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">might be able to offer some word</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.049" end="00:03:38.019" style="s2">pictures that trigger in us memories and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">and visions of home but you know one</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.019" end="00:03:43.480" style="s2">that one of the things that that CS</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:46.139" style="s2">Lewis talks about in the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.480" end="00:03:50.709" style="s2">mere christianity with his argument</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.139" end="00:03:54.359" style="s2">argument from desire is that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.709" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">a longing and a sense for this this</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.359" end="00:04:00.880" style="s2">really I mean and even home I mean again</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">the being we have a sense for being</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.880" end="00:04:06.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s all of the it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:10.060" style="s2">thing you know it&#39;s in Christian terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.670" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">the language is consummation yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.060" end="00:04:14.650" style="s2">is obviously connected to a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.049" style="s2">consummating of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.650" end="00:04:20.590" style="s2">marriage and in the book of Revelation</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.049" end="00:04:21.430" style="s2">it&#39;s the consummation of Christ and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.590" end="00:04:24.250" style="s2">bride</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.430" end="00:04:24.699" style="s2">it&#39;s the consummation of heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.250" end="00:04:32.979" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.699" end="00:04:38.020" style="s2">it&#39;s the consummation and and there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.979" end="00:04:42.430" style="s2">don&#39;t you know Lois points out we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.020" end="00:04:47.250" style="s2">get there here and now yeah we taste it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.430" end="00:04:51.160" style="s2">and and Lois notes that that the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.250" end="00:04:55.990" style="s2">tasting of it is spread liberally in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.160" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s the some of the best meals I</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.990" end="00:05:00.610" style="s2">ever had were in some of the poorest</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:04.690" style="s2">most remarkable remote communities you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.610" end="00:05:07.870" style="s2">could imagine where you know usually</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.690" end="00:05:10.750" style="s2">women would sit by a charcoal fire and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.870" end="00:05:13.810" style="s2">work on a meal of some fish and some</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.750" end="00:05:15.669" style="s2">rice and a few seasonings they could get</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.810" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">together and that meal would be cooked</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.669" end="00:05:21.430" style="s2">over the three or four hours we had in</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">the church service and then you come out</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.430" end="00:05:28.270" style="s2">and you know and you think wow so these</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">people who have so little at least they</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.270" end="00:05:36.310" style="s2">get to share in this joy yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:42.130" style="s2">and and so that then and this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.310" end="00:05:44.979" style="s2">the reason that I you know will you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.130" end="00:05:47.349" style="s2">pry you can try to you know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.979" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">giving up my hope of heaven I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.349" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">giving up my hope of home because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:06:01.810" style="s2">know even the even just the even the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:06.430" style="s2">hoping for it yeah is is a participation</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.810" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">yeah in home and and often be closest I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.430" end="00:06:14.909" style="s2">can get in this space and time where all</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:18.250" style="s2">of us feel it&#39;s um all of us miss it</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.909" end="00:06:21.669" style="s2">just oh I&#39;m really appreciating kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.250" end="00:06:24.130" style="s2">like as your as you I feel like I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.669" end="00:06:26.740" style="s2">took a walk with you right so as I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:28.039" style="s2">as the process of understanding what</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.740" end="00:06:32.659" style="s2">you&#39;re just saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.039" end="00:06:37.389" style="s2">I felt like on some level I had to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.659" end="00:06:40.129" style="s2">actually recognize what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.389" end="00:06:42.039" style="s2">in a certain sense I just felt really I</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.129" end="00:06:46.339" style="s2">appreciated the way that you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.039" end="00:06:48.499" style="s2">expressed that and I I noticed that what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.339" end="00:06:52.520" style="s2">comes up for me when you say that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.499" end="00:06:56.589" style="s2">like he will use the year that the word</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.520" end="00:06:59.089" style="s2">yearned for home mmm a yearning is to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.589" end="00:07:02.779" style="s2">seems to always kind of Connaught ate</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.089" end="00:07:07.430" style="s2">that and like a yearning in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.779" end="00:07:09.770" style="s2">is it usually kind of evokes something</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.430" end="00:07:12.649" style="s2">that you can&#39;t get like an object you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.770" end="00:07:15.370" style="s2">can&#39;t possess you yearn for God or you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.649" end="00:07:18.229" style="s2">yearn for something transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.370" end="00:07:21.589" style="s2">therefore in some level the yearning</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.229" end="00:07:23.779" style="s2">itself is its announcement right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.589" end="00:07:28.279" style="s2">like it so in other words it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.779" end="00:07:30.229" style="s2">very I felt like on one level this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.279" end="00:07:32.719" style="s2">a very intimate thing to yearn for</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.229" end="00:07:36.139" style="s2">something and it and it announced I</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.719" end="00:07:39.229" style="s2">think it probably displays a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.139" end="00:07:43.339" style="s2">of the nature of what home is because</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.229" end="00:07:48.019" style="s2">there&#39;s something um in Rilke uh in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.339" end="00:07:51.050" style="s2">first dueño eulogies um the first one</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.019" end="00:07:53.419" style="s2">where he&#39;s talking about like he says he</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.050" end="00:07:58.580" style="s2">said something like this is like even in</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.419" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">the warm animals gaze mm-hmm right it</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.580" end="00:08:06.019" style="s2">knows we are not at home in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:08.089" style="s2">interpreted world and I and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.019" end="00:08:09.499" style="s2">what I just heard him that like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.089" end="00:08:12.499" style="s2">went through my mind what I heard him</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.499" end="00:08:19.969" style="s2">that is like actually so much of home</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.499" end="00:08:24.159" style="s2">this for us right is so wedded to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.969" end="00:08:28.580" style="s2">the that home needs to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.159" end="00:08:30.430" style="s2">we&#39;re constantly yearning for but in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.580" end="00:08:35.870" style="s2">yearning means that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.430" end="00:08:38.569" style="s2">ungettable yet the thing were yearning</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.870" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">for is inherently ungettable so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.569" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">kind of like there is that quality I</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.130" end="00:08:42.709" style="s2">know in a conversation</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.929" end="00:17:31.540" style="s2">thought about this over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.459" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">over again they poured their life into</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.299" end="00:17:54.159" style="s2">was a guarantee that that was gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.130" end="00:17:56.200" style="s2">out like on some level I think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.159" end="00:18:01.000" style="s2">pouring was in the presence of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.200" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">recognition of unable to fulfill in any</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.000" end="00:18:06.880" style="s2">controlled way whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:09.040" style="s2">pouring of my life and you know it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.040" end="00:18:15.900" style="s2">in in many ways they could probably be</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.280" end="00:18:18.669" style="s2">like clever doneness but but they</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.900" end="00:18:21.850" style="s2">thought of me when it was cold right</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.460" end="00:23:25.870" style="s2">ourselves too because every marriage you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:29.610" style="s2">know there are moments in marriage of of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.870" end="00:23:32.970" style="s2">bliss yeah but there&#39;s they&#39;re far more</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.610" end="00:23:36.250" style="s2">moments in marriage of longing of</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.970" end="00:23:39.790" style="s2">longing for home of longing for</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.250" end="00:23:42.340" style="s2">communion of of wishing that that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.790" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">could live up to the the needs and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.340" end="00:23:46.600" style="s2">desires of the other and the other could</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.600" end="00:23:51.490" style="s2">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s in that tension I</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.960" end="00:23:54.690" style="s2">think that we are pulled</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.490" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">we are pulled into the future and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">institutions like marriage that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:05.320" style="s2">form and shape that institutions like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">Parenthood that that do this and so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.320" end="00:24:11.230" style="s2">know to bring it back to wisdom you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">wisdom is knowing how what is a marriage</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.230" end="00:24:20.140" style="s2">marriage is you know wisdom plus agency</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:23.380" style="s2">and and that then you get an institution</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.140" end="00:24:27.700" style="s2">and and children hopefully will learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.380" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">from that yeah and it&#39;s just this oh my</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.700" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">you know you know as I&#39;m thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:40.810" style="s2">like I think we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.730" end="00:24:45.880" style="s2">unconditional love like we know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.810" end="00:24:48.330" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about right like what and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.880" end="00:24:51.040" style="s2">I&#39;m really hearing a like it just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.330" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">erratic I&#39;m getting a radically</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.040" end="00:24:54.910" style="s2">different picture of what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:24:58.390" style="s2">about because on some level what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.910" end="00:25:01.060" style="s2">hearing is that like with the father</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.390" end="00:25:03.340" style="s2">who&#39;s been in his in whatever way that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.060" end="00:25:07.080" style="s2">he can at 60 is poring over and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.340" end="00:25:12.580" style="s2">almost certainly not gonna work out</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.080" end="00:25:15.580" style="s2">right yet he pours right Eve hordes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.580" end="00:25:17.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not like because it&#39;s not only not</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.580" end="00:25:19.240" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is when I think what</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.680" end="00:25:21.910" style="s2">I&#39;m getting I see if I can bring words</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.240" end="00:25:24.550" style="s2">to it it&#39;s like I think if they walk</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.910" end="00:25:28.030" style="s2">with this it&#39;s like I but I&#39;m getting is</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.550" end="00:25:30.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not only that he&#39;s doing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.030" end="00:25:36.130" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s not gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.140" end="00:25:40.040" style="s2">but even if it did work out that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.130" end="00:25:44.840" style="s2">yearning would still be there it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.040" end="00:25:46.070" style="s2">it&#39;s radically unconditional like honey</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.840" end="00:25:47.130" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking now I&#39;m really thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.070" end="00:25:50.199" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:50.199" style="s2">[Music]</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.270" end="00:26:06.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a profound reason why that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.010" end="00:26:08.870" style="s2">captured us right yeah it&#39;s like what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">my understanding is when I studied</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.870" end="00:26:13.070" style="s2">painting it like that scene is always</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:14.870" style="s2">before that was always very depicted</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.070" end="00:26:16.670" style="s2">depicted where it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.870" end="00:26:19.160" style="s2">human being was the meat or one that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.670" end="00:26:21.920" style="s2">yearning for God and like God was kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.160" end="00:26:25.190" style="s2">of a you know a distance or an</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.920" end="00:26:27.380" style="s2">indifference or sturdiness to it but all</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.190" end="00:26:29.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t like you know it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.380" end="00:26:31.880" style="s2">that painting is considered the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.420" end="00:26:34.220" style="s2">culmination or the peak of humanism of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.880" end="00:26:37.400" style="s2">the Renaissance right and no wonder it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.220" end="00:26:41.750" style="s2">like because here Michael a Jose like</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.400" end="00:26:46.490" style="s2">know God has tendons and guts and like</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.750" end="00:26:51.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s like eternity actually yearns</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.490" end="00:26:54.350" style="s2">for finitude right like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.350" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">that sense in the pit and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.350" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">touch and if they did touch no one would</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:04.730" style="s2">even look at that painting it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.160" style="s2">they don&#39;t touch which is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.730" end="00:27:09.800" style="s2">touch is so touching about it right the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.160" end="00:27:11.210" style="s2">sense of and I oftentimes have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.800" end="00:27:13.700" style="s2">that picture of like when I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.210" end="00:27:15.950" style="s2">really really like with people and like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.700" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">you really see their hearts I could just</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.950" end="00:27:20.300" style="s2">get this sense it&#39;s almost like in every</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:23.540" style="s2">human heart is are those two fingers and</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.300" end="00:27:25.310" style="s2">that experience you know and just like</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.540" end="00:27:26.990" style="s2">the movie in the book that was written</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.310" end="00:27:30.140" style="s2">about Michelangelo they call it the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.990" end="00:27:32.810" style="s2">agony and the ecstasy and there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.140" end="00:27:37.160" style="s2">this is this is like whatever this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.810" end="00:27:41.420" style="s2">right seems to be an experience of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.160" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">absolute like could be torturous but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.420" end="00:27:48.770" style="s2">and the very same thing can be ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:51.590" style="s2">and I&#39;m I&#39;m just present to that as</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.770" end="00:27:53.300" style="s2">you&#39;re talking of that on some level</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.300" end="00:27:58.750" style="s2">personal</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:54.550" style="s2">allows for the importance of home to be</p>
