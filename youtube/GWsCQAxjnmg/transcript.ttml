<p begin="00:00:09.280" end="00:00:19.630" style="s2">a good I would say jumping-off point</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.220" end="00:00:22.630" style="s2">sure conversation because there&#39;s a your</p>

<p begin="00:00:22.630" end="00:00:28.689" style="s2">current partner yeah about four years</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.570" end="00:00:30.009" style="s2">and and you&#39;re talking about how thick</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.689" end="00:00:32.710" style="s2">he was right</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.009" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">or did sure oh yeah she&#39;s incredibly be</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.710" end="00:00:46.300" style="s2">a person and I mean I mean she I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:49.030" style="s2">think I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.300" end="00:00:50.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s a coincidence that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.030" end="00:00:53.230" style="s2">really working on this notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.710" end="00:00:55.630" style="s2">inexhaustible yeah as the way of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.230" end="00:00:56.920" style="s2">disclosing reality and the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.630" end="00:00:58.150" style="s2">I have with her I&#39;m going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.920" end="00:01:00.010" style="s2">referring to her neutrally because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.150" end="00:01:01.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think she&#39;ll want her name may be</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.010" end="00:01:04.299" style="s2">public yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.720" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">and so I hope people understand that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.299" end="00:01:11.110" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean any impersonality on</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:12.970" style="s2">my part towards her but yeah I had like</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.110" end="00:01:16.840" style="s2">I said that sense of the inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.970" end="00:01:19.210" style="s2">Ness she&#39;s incredibly deep and like I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.840" end="00:01:21.880" style="s2">say and I don&#39;t mean just intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.210" end="00:01:26.710" style="s2">what she is but especially spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.880" end="00:01:28.720" style="s2">and emotionally and she&#39;s this is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.710" end="00:01:31.930" style="s2">inadequate word she I find her so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.720" end="00:01:38.049" style="s2">mature her ability to bring a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.930" end="00:01:39.940" style="s2">wisdom to bear on situations and but but</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.049" end="00:01:43.620" style="s2">in a messed with you know with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.940" end="00:01:46.270" style="s2">vulnerability so it calls out she she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.620" end="00:01:48.940" style="s2">reliably capable of calling out the very</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.270" end="00:01:53.860" style="s2">best in me and she tells me that I do</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.940" end="00:01:55.960" style="s2">the same for her and so that it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.860" end="00:02:00.460" style="s2">it continues to be a very very profound</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.960" end="00:02:06.700" style="s2">experience I believe for both of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.460" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s the the way in which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.700" end="00:02:10.899" style="s2">a measure to get I really mean this all</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.299" style="s2">of these terms have been rendered trite</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.899" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">right now because of our mass marketing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.299" end="00:02:17.980" style="s2">of and our over emphasis on romantic</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:20.349" style="s2">relationships but you know if we just</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.980" end="00:02:22.490" style="s2">pop it was again what what I also heard</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.349" end="00:02:24.170" style="s2">and sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.490" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">I heard a few different things like one</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.170" end="00:02:36.590" style="s2">is one is I heard depth very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:43.340" style="s2">inexhaustible capacity for wisdom yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.590" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">and the ability to call out yes but of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.340" end="00:02:47.510" style="s2">course you hear me saying these all</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:50.600" style="s2">analytically but they&#39;re not right they</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.510" end="00:02:54.200" style="s2">are all just yeah different facets and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.600" end="00:02:56.570" style="s2">aspects of the same thing which for lack</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.200" end="00:02:58.550" style="s2">of a better term and I don&#39;t mean any</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.570" end="00:03:01.010" style="s2">commitment to a Christian Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.550" end="00:03:02.900" style="s2">metaphysics but this is Sarah&#39;s soul and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.010" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">as I was about to say I find her my soul</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.900" end="00:03:09.470" style="s2">mate and here we connect that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:11.720" style="s2">the foundations of our psyches in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.470" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">really profound and profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.720" end="00:03:20.210" style="s2">nourishing way and so like I said I I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.970" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">mean I would admire saw if I just knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.210" end="00:03:24.590" style="s2">her as a friend</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">because she&#39;s such an incredibly decent</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.590" end="00:03:28.370" style="s2">and people I said her name I said I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to incredibly a decent and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.370" end="00:03:34.340" style="s2">deep person so the fact that I I feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:36.020" style="s2">they&#39;re privileged to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.340" end="00:03:37.610" style="s2">relationship with her and that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.020" end="00:03:39.320" style="s2">feels every day I mean we have our</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.610" end="00:03:41.240" style="s2">conflicts everybody does because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.320" end="00:03:43.010" style="s2">human beings more complex and were all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.240" end="00:03:44.660" style="s2">wounded and traumatized by our pasts</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.010" end="00:03:48.350" style="s2">great but what I what I what I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.660" end="00:03:50.630" style="s2">found is and this is this is engendered</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.350" end="00:03:52.310" style="s2">a deep trust I found that we are both</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.630" end="00:03:54.350" style="s2">capable of being vulnerable about our</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.310" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">flaws and bringing them to real</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.350" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">discussion results in something more</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:01.580" style="s2">than just reconciliation when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:05.090" style="s2">been conflict it&#39;s more like a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.580" end="00:04:08.210" style="s2">a deeper reconnection in virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.090" end="00:04:10.340" style="s2">having discussed through the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.210" end="00:04:12.020" style="s2">and the issues please don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:22.010" end="00:05:26.270" style="s2">it because it&#39;s not something I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.390" end="00:05:28.730" style="s2">provoke or instigate she calls forth for</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.270" end="00:05:34.430" style="s2">me yeah the best poetry I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.730" end="00:05:36.710" style="s2">written sort of some of the most um I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.430" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to call it not the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.710" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">insightful philosophical mmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:47.480" style="s2">realizations yeah it&#39;s like I say these</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:48.740" style="s2">words these words that we&#39;ve crafted</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.480" end="00:05:52.220" style="s2">they seem to fail</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.740" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">I mean she&#39;s more I mean she&#39;s my best</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.220" end="00:05:55.490" style="s2">friend but she&#39;s more than a friend I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:57.350" style="s2">mean you&#39;re a good friend and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.490" end="00:05:59.240" style="s2">appreciate that and you know I value it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.350" end="00:06:01.670" style="s2">with what we are what we are cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.240" end="00:06:03.320" style="s2">together I value it very deeply and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.670" end="00:06:05.690" style="s2">don&#39;t misunderstand what I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.320" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">say but foot sorry it&#39;s it&#39;s at a level</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.690" end="00:06:18.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s a level beyond that and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:19.790" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s for both of us it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.350" end="00:06:21.020" style="s2">brings with it therefore a challenge</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.790" end="00:06:23.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an odd thing to say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.020" end="00:06:27.920" style="s2">something so good is challenging</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:29.030" style="s2">precisely because it is so good because</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.920" end="00:06:31.190" style="s2">you know the brain is a prediction</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.030" end="00:06:33.380" style="s2">machine and it prefers predictable</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.190" end="00:06:36.320" style="s2">unhappiness predictable and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.380" end="00:06:38.690" style="s2">over surprising happiness definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.320" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">prefers predictable unhappiness over</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.690" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">surprising happiness it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:45.770" style="s2">right and so and so it&#39;s like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:48.320" style="s2">a problem the brain is good well this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.770" end="00:06:49.820" style="s2">a problem you&#39;re so happy right and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.320" end="00:06:51.650" style="s2">don&#39;t mean Goethe</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.820" end="00:06:53.990" style="s2">you know I mean happy in the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.650" end="00:06:56.420" style="s2">deep sense of connectedness and meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.990" end="00:06:58.730" style="s2">right and so the brain you know your</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.420" end="00:07:01.370" style="s2">frame problematizes it and then it it</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.730" end="00:07:02.930" style="s2">tries to turn what I think is a pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.370" end="00:07:06.530" style="s2">problem because if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.930" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">unfamiliarity of the goodness into a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.530" end="00:07:10.190" style="s2">of trying to say well you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">like something from the past in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.190" end="00:07:15.080" style="s2">you got hurt and so we talk about those</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:19.040" style="s2">kinds of things a lot we bring it up we</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.080" end="00:07:20.420" style="s2">bring out you know that how that if</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.040" end="00:07:23.090" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the sunlight of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.420" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">goodness cast the shadow of doubt and as</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.090" end="00:07:26.990" style="s2">the sunlight gets more intense that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">shadow seems to darken in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.990" end="00:07:31.940" style="s2">corresponding manner and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">keep you have to we keep reconnecting to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.940" end="00:07:36.470" style="s2">each other and that&#39;s tricky right</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.740" end="00:07:39.010" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to express there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.470" end="00:07:44.030" style="s2">need with the need we all have without</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:47.570" style="s2">deifying the person in any way or ray of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.030" end="00:07:53.980" style="s2">finding the person in any way and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.570" end="00:07:58.220" style="s2">know and to to deeply connect well also</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.980" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">really about safing and caring about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.220" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">person&#39;s autonomy so these are all</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.900" end="00:08:06.860" style="s2">things that again as you get as you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:09.650" style="s2">to get I find at least as you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:11.870" style="s2">get so much closer to a person all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.650" end="00:08:15.110" style="s2">the existential tensions that Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.870" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">and Heidegger and kirkegaard even that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.110" end="00:08:19.460" style="s2">what you talk about they get highlighted</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:21.290" style="s2">and they get that the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.460" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">relationship and pregnat them and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.290" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">vibrate more and more and more and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">you have to if you have to give date you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.550" style="s2">have to get together and turn that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.620" style="s2">vibration into sort of a dance that</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.550" end="00:08:32.900" style="s2">keeps you sort of resonating with each</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.620" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">other is it I think what I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.900" end="00:08:38.030" style="s2">say is that the difference because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.169" end="00:08:41.450" style="s2">would imagine that those existential</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.030" end="00:08:43.400" style="s2">tensions can come up and they can be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:44.810" style="s2">beat when they come up they can be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.400" end="00:08:47.390" style="s2">beginning of the end of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.810" end="00:08:50.420" style="s2">or the beginning of of it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.390" end="00:08:51.770" style="s2">flourishing yes and I think what I am</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.420" end="00:08:53.420" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing you say is if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.770" end="00:08:54.650" style="s2">kind of connection between the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.420" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">difference that makes a difference to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.650" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">vulnerability oh very much so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.880" end="00:09:05.850" style="s2">I have found I mentioned this to you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:09.260" style="s2">before that my trust is usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.850" end="00:09:13.589" style="s2">engendered when I sense that somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.260" end="00:09:15.300" style="s2">willing to color you know calibrate with</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.589" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">me their degree of vulnerability I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be super vulnerable in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:18.839" style="s2">every interaction because that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:24.830" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.839" end="00:09:27.480" style="s2">right but with somebody who is going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.830" end="00:09:30.510" style="s2">see the depths of my vulnerability it</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.480" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">they she creates great trust to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.510" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">because she brings up and expresses a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:37.500" style="s2">similar corresponding vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:39.540" style="s2">I do and I don&#39;t mean that in a needy</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.500" end="00:09:41.670" style="s2">sort of vampiric fashion in which she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.540" end="00:09:43.620" style="s2">trying to you know save me or anything</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.670" end="00:09:45.870" style="s2">like that no that&#39;s where the maturity</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.620" end="00:09:48.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a the the maturity gives her a</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.870" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">centeredness so that vulnerability is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.660" end="00:09:54.089" style="s2">never something that is draining me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s more something like I said what it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.089" end="00:10:00.660" style="s2">does for me is it tends to engender a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:03.899" style="s2">profound kind of resonant trust yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.660" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">the and it&#39;s and so that what I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.899" end="00:10:11.430" style="s2">hearing too in this and this also</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:13.079" style="s2">harkens to me like things I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.430" end="00:10:15.270" style="s2">thinking about myself for years and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.079" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">noticing and making sense of is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.270" end="00:10:20.010" style="s2">you&#39;ve just made this connection between</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">I really appreciated between like these</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.010" end="00:10:27.899" style="s2">existential tensions right that that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.500" end="00:10:29.790" style="s2">route that your relationship can be will</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.899" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">one is they inherently bring them all</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.790" end="00:10:37.890" style="s2">right very much very much but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:40.290" style="s2">relationship can be a like bring them up</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.890" end="00:10:42.410" style="s2">and they can be a crucible right is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.290" end="00:10:45.240" style="s2">what the word to use like the crucible</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.410" end="00:10:47.310" style="s2">so I did use it but it&#39;s a good word and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.240" end="00:10:48.899" style="s2">like in a certain set in the Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.310" end="00:10:53.070" style="s2">sense of the word or the existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.899" end="00:10:58.339" style="s2">sense of the word of being the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.070" end="00:11:04.410" style="s2">the mechanism of their transformation or</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.339" end="00:11:08.300" style="s2">the covering up in the demise right I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.410" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">think so I mean again I&#39;m very wary of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.300" end="00:11:12.890" style="s2">holding myself up as any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:16.370" style="s2">authority on this because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.890" end="00:11:18.680" style="s2">but yeah I think that&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.370" end="00:11:20.990" style="s2">case I mean part of what I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.680" end="00:11:22.550" style="s2">about this is perhaps part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.990" end="00:11:23.960" style="s2">confusion I mean there&#39;s a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.550" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">historical reasons so I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.960" end="00:11:27.410" style="s2">this is the sole cause and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:28.970" style="s2">confusion I think people get into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.410" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">romantic relationships where they try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.970" end="00:11:33.860" style="s2">elevate them to the status of God or</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:35.270" style="s2">something like that yeah is is to convey</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.860" end="00:11:36.470" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ll use of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.270" end="00:11:38.690" style="s2">language here it&#39;s to confuse a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.470" end="00:11:41.960" style="s2">criterion with with with an entity right</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.690" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">the the these relationships they call up</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.960" end="00:11:46.310" style="s2">into our awareness some of our you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">some of our deeper deepest existential</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.310" end="00:11:50.750" style="s2">structures right I think we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:53.030" style="s2">therefore confuse that of their ability</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.750" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">to call them up and accentuate them with</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.030" end="00:11:57.110" style="s2">thinking that they are the source and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:12:00.140" style="s2">the remedy you have those structures and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.110" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">I think and and so people I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.140" end="00:12:05.900" style="s2">sometimes confuse the intensity of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">feeling yeah of these of the grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.900" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">our ontology or personal anthologies</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:12.740" style="s2">right with the idea that well that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:16.130" style="s2">relationship is the generator and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.740" end="00:12:18.530" style="s2">sustainer and and and the resolver of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.130" end="00:12:20.090" style="s2">these and I think that&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.530" end="00:12:23.450" style="s2">mistake I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.090" end="00:12:28.340" style="s2">fundamental mistake yeah yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.450" end="00:12:32.510" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it is and knapping the case</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.340" end="00:12:34.040" style="s2">at the same time if we if we relate to I</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.510" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">would imagine this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:41.900" style="s2">vulnerability that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">right is is I come to you and I realize</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.900" end="00:12:47.720" style="s2">I realize where I fall short</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:51.590" style="s2">I realize where I imagine that you fall</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.720" end="00:12:55.400" style="s2">short I see my own judgments my own</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.590" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">criticisms my own and I see yours on</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.400" end="00:13:00.170" style="s2">some on some level and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:02.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which that if I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.170" end="00:13:04.490" style="s2">because my you know there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">difference I think between vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.490" end="00:13:11.210" style="s2">and and exposure is that experience of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:12.980" style="s2">being exposed which usually has it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.210" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">elements of that&#39;s usually the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.980" end="00:13:17.210" style="s2">stuff that traumatize this that&#39;s racket</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">here you know you&#39;re in play guard and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.210" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">your friends come up behind you do they</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:24.530" style="s2">pull your pants down and there you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:26.120" style="s2">exposed and then you know you know 10</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.530" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">years of therapy to kind of get over</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.120" end="00:13:29.690" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:32.150" style="s2">yeah exposure usually brings shame</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.690" end="00:13:34.940" style="s2">totally and then there&#39;s owner ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.150" end="00:13:36.770" style="s2">which i think is what I&#39;m I think is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.940" end="00:13:38.420" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing you talk about here in</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.770" end="00:13:40.970" style="s2">your relationship is that there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.420" end="00:13:46.570" style="s2">oh I&#39;ve been more vulnerable ie I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.970" end="00:13:48.950" style="s2">been more willing to volunteer to share</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.570" end="00:13:53.510" style="s2">what&#39;s difficult for me to share and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.950" end="00:13:55.520" style="s2">revealing myself right even if even if</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.510" end="00:13:56.210" style="s2">my experience of you is I feel it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.520" end="00:13:57.830" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.210" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">I would actually still violent I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.830" end="00:14:04.340" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t I invited on some level or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.990" style="s2">volunteer yeah it&#39;s a difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.340" end="00:14:08.960" style="s2">quality of the attention seconds</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.990" end="00:14:11.150" style="s2">eventually me but you just say you just</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.150" end="00:14:16.400" style="s2">few seconds eventually and yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.960" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.400" end="00:14:21.230" style="s2">difference right there&#39;s a felt</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.380" end="00:14:56.690" style="s2">vulnerability and I&#39;m green with that</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.690" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">instead nourishing it feels like yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.150" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">this is this this hurts or this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:07.820" style="s2">wounded but it&#39;s it&#39;s not probative in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:10.580" style="s2">the sense of well maybe I can exploit</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.820" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">this weakness it&#39;s instead well here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.580" end="00:15:16.520" style="s2">here&#39;s a way in which we can deeply</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:20.450" style="s2">connect and here&#39;s how you know I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.520" end="00:15:25.180" style="s2">allow you perhaps to use me as a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.450" end="00:15:27.890" style="s2">to reflect upon that that wound or that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.180" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">that hurt and so it&#39;s much more than</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:38.150" style="s2">that but that&#39;s it&#39;s she&#39;s acting like</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:40.400" style="s2">this beneficent mirror and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.150" end="00:15:43.520" style="s2">that in a dismissive fashion I need</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.400" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">in a sense that and instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.520" end="00:15:48.350" style="s2">the hungry gays that is exceeding</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:50.300" style="s2">seeking exploitation its instead the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.350" end="00:15:54.770" style="s2">mindful me here that that&#39;s allowing me</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.300" end="00:15:56.120" style="s2">to look and reflect upon this from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.770" end="00:15:58.400" style="s2">different in a different way in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.120" end="00:15:59.960" style="s2">different angle she&#39;s a master at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.400" end="00:16:02.330" style="s2">and I mean that as a compliment she can</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.960" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">often get me to restructure my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.330" end="00:16:08.390" style="s2">when I&#39;m in the some of the depths of my</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:12.260" style="s2">wounds that I find extremely affording</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.390" end="00:16:13.820" style="s2">of me moving changing going to it going</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.260" end="00:16:16.670" style="s2">to a different place than I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.820" end="00:16:18.050" style="s2">been it she says I do the same for her</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.670" end="00:16:20.330" style="s2">and I have reason to believe this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.050" end="00:16:24.560" style="s2">true and so this is part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.330" end="00:16:26.570" style="s2">regularly do with each other hmm Wow Wow</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.560" end="00:16:27.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a quality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.570" end="00:16:32.540" style="s2">something there that just really</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.760" end="00:16:35.210" style="s2">highlight something really rich which I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.540" end="00:16:37.339" style="s2">believe is what part of what Christopher</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.210" end="00:16:41.089" style="s2">and I were talking about oh that was an</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.339" end="00:16:45.200" style="s2">amazing conference uh he oh my gosh he</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.089" end="00:16:48.500" style="s2">is so lyrical and articulate and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.200" end="00:16:50.750" style="s2">depths that he brings up so effortlessly</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.500" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">just it&#39;s like you know somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.750" end="00:16:54.770" style="s2">churning the depths of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.970" end="00:16:57.260" style="s2">Pacific Ocean and stuff comes to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.770" end="00:16:57.910" style="s2">surface so readily for him this is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.260" end="00:17:01.160" style="s2">impressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.910" end="00:17:04.089" style="s2">totally yeah and in one of the things he</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.160" end="00:17:06.980" style="s2">kept highlighting is after this</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.089" end="00:17:09.350" style="s2">conversation with with him that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.980" end="00:17:14.050" style="s2">right you know him just expressing his</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.350" end="00:17:15.890" style="s2">thoughts are they do they arrive in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.050" end="00:17:17.660" style="s2">articulation at least in that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.890" end="00:17:19.910" style="s2">conversation in the conversation I the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.660" end="00:17:24.140" style="s2">other conversation I saw with him in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.910" end="00:17:27.940" style="s2">Paul was a certain level of a lyrical</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.140" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">disc but like it that expresses a such</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.940" end="00:17:37.309" style="s2">deeply existential and and religious yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:41.480" style="s2">religious structures just fell out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.309" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">him right I deeply respect finding</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.480" end="00:17:44.870" style="s2">myself landed in that sense and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:46.040" style="s2">one of the things that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.870" end="00:17:48.200" style="s2">about is one of the things he really</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:51.429" style="s2">highlighted what was this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.200" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">just in the most basic forms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.429" end="00:17:57.350" style="s2">listening and speaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:18:00.380" style="s2">and this one how mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.350" end="00:18:02.510" style="s2">that is right just the act the simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.380" end="00:18:05.420" style="s2">act of the most common thing that we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.510" end="00:18:08.420" style="s2">all day long which is we talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.420" end="00:18:10.070" style="s2">other right yeah if you look at it but</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.420" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">if you what I really kind of got from</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.070" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">that conversation is like if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:17.420" style="s2">just that in itself and you actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:20.660" style="s2">just really look at it it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.420" end="00:18:23.720" style="s2">and more mysterious right and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.660" end="00:18:29.179" style="s2">the ontological sense of mystery yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.720" end="00:18:31.400" style="s2">mean yeah very much I mean that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.179" end="00:18:39.650" style="s2">meant were about the inexhaustible nurse</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.400" end="00:18:41.929" style="s2">and if I mean yeah I mean there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.650" end="00:18:43.040" style="s2">sense philosophically theoretically and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.929" end="00:18:45.440" style="s2">I argue for this in some of my videos</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.040" end="00:18:47.330" style="s2">and this is you know Blake&#39;s idea to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.440" end="00:18:49.640" style="s2">a world in a grain of sand you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.330" end="00:18:52.010" style="s2">every every lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.640" end="00:18:56.030" style="s2">everything or every object has that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.010" end="00:18:58.130" style="s2">potential for us we we could find</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.030" end="00:18:59.990" style="s2">anything because everything is</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.130" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">ultimately combinatorially explosive and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.990" end="00:19:04.100" style="s2">what it is I find I&#39;ve coined this term</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:05.150" style="s2">and thought the thing in itself or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.100" end="00:19:07.220" style="s2">thing beyond itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.150" end="00:19:11.630" style="s2">everything is always beyond itself right</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.220" end="00:19:15.110" style="s2">and so you&#39;re not but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.630" end="00:19:16.100" style="s2">about and I do have those experiences I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.110" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">guess you&#39;d call the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.100" end="00:19:20.929" style="s2">experiences of nature or coming across a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">beautiful object or sometimes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.929" end="00:19:24.140" style="s2">in deep some annotation of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:27.830" style="s2">experience of the breath or the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.140" end="00:19:29.929" style="s2">life so I do have those but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.830" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">there&#39;s a quality that is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.929" end="00:19:33.320" style="s2">something that I&#39;m exploring and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:35.660" style="s2">work I&#39;m doing on the next series about</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.320" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">dialogue and dialectic right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.660" end="00:19:42.290" style="s2">quality that comes in there it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:44.030" style="s2">like the third man factor that they talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.290" end="00:19:45.740" style="s2">about where you know people get when</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.030" end="00:19:47.540" style="s2">they&#39;re you know these expeditions and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.740" end="00:19:49.490" style="s2">they sort of hallucinate mutually</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.540" end="00:19:51.950" style="s2">hallucinate this this third presence</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.490" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s there but there&#39;s this element in</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.950" end="00:19:56.929" style="s2">dialogue and I&#39;ve been reading a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">about it and trying to get that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.929" end="00:20:04.510" style="s2">which is given Steinbach in his book on</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.170" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.830" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">hey so it&#39;s like is it fair to say so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:20.750" style="s2">that I think I your act I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:25.550" style="s2">think what you&#39;re talking about I&#39;ll ask</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.750" end="00:21:28.820" style="s2">you this is the way that that which</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.550" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">can&#39;t be provoked right in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.820" end="00:21:37.780" style="s2">existence in the in the dialogue is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:37.780" style="s2">that what happens what for example when</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.380" end="00:21:43.130" style="s2">when you call when you when you name</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.970" end="00:21:45.290" style="s2">something in the dialogue at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.130" end="00:21:48.500" style="s2">where you where we realize that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.290" end="00:21:50.120" style="s2">both what&#39;s doing the talking what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.500" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">talking about is what&#39;s doing the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.120" end="00:21:54.800" style="s2">talking yes great those moments of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:56.210" style="s2">oh where the logo straight you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.800" end="00:21:59.570" style="s2">talking about the Lord all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.210" end="00:22:05.210" style="s2">do the logos is speaking right right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.570" end="00:22:08.630" style="s2">but there&#39;s this quality where that it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.210" end="00:22:12.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t know it and till it all we were</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.630" end="00:22:15.740" style="s2">already in it right yes yes like no you</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.740" end="00:22:17.240" style="s2">said it I wasn&#39;t recognizing that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.740" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">in fact was happening but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.240" end="00:22:21.910" style="s2">something about that is so intriguing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">me about</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.910" end="00:22:26.570" style="s2">that the most important thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:29.480" style="s2">would want to be able to point to and</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.570" end="00:22:34.220" style="s2">just happen and provoke that even if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.480" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">tried to do that if it was if it that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.220" end="00:22:40.730" style="s2">find ourselves already inside of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">begun right that we couldn&#39;t provoke has</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.730" end="00:22:47.150" style="s2">this quality of not recognizing it until</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:50.980" style="s2">we&#39;re already in it are they there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.150" end="00:22:53.390" style="s2">deep reason for that because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.980" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">think and this is the Platini an idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.390" end="00:22:57.410" style="s2">but ultimately like is only known by</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:59.810" style="s2">like there&#39;s sort of the core of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.410" end="00:23:03.920" style="s2">conformity theory I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.810" end="00:23:06.020" style="s2">recognize the logos except by means of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.920" end="00:23:07.640" style="s2">being immersed in the logos I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.020" end="00:23:10.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the original that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.640" end="00:23:12.530" style="s2">thrusting insights are in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.160" end="00:23:16.010" style="s2">Platonic tradition that right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.530" end="00:23:17.960" style="s2">recognize the logos until the logo sees</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.010" end="00:23:20.960" style="s2">itself presence because the logos puts</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.960" end="00:23:23.810" style="s2">you into alright the very state by which</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.960" end="00:23:25.610" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s recognition as possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.810" end="00:23:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the self presencing of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.610" end="00:23:29.960" style="s2">that makes it possible for it to be you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.920" end="00:23:32.740" style="s2">know free it for it to become present to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.960" end="00:23:35.480" style="s2">you it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a grounding thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.740" end="00:23:37.940" style="s2">it&#39;s very much like you know if you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.480" end="00:23:40.400" style="s2">incapable of love right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.940" end="00:23:43.130" style="s2">recognize it in other people use you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.400" end="00:23:45.470" style="s2">have to be in love to some degree to</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:47.600" style="s2">really recognize the love in another</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.470" end="00:23:49.700" style="s2">person these things this is what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.600" end="00:23:52.430" style="s2">by their being participatory we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.700" end="00:23:55.220" style="s2">make them we don&#39;t merely receive them</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.430" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">we&#39;re not passive victims we&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.220" end="00:24:01.910" style="s2">know we&#39;re not you know purely active</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:05.150" style="s2">architects we me right we we conform to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.910" end="00:24:06.890" style="s2">them we embody them but we also right</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.150" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">reach out to them and are called forth</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.890" end="00:24:14.300" style="s2">by them these are all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:17.900" style="s2">are you know the this is this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.300" end="00:24:21.800" style="s2">mean I think the deal logos is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.900" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">trying to make multiple people mutually</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.800" end="00:24:27.560" style="s2">receptive to the participation in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.090" style="s2">logos and and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.560" end="00:24:31.460" style="s2">tricky thing and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.090" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">I thought that gets lost is when</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.460" end="00:24:34.820" style="s2">Aristotle takes the logos in turns to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:39.380" style="s2">turn it into logic</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.820" end="00:24:41.780" style="s2">all right then we lose logic is</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.380" end="00:24:44.030" style="s2">important and I am NOT a person that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.780" end="00:24:45.650" style="s2">denigrates logic but what one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.030" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2">things we lose is because logic is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.650" end="00:24:49.550" style="s2">something that over which we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">exercise this mastery right you get this</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.550" end="00:24:55.220" style="s2">control right we lose that we lose</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:56.870" style="s2">something important I mean err slow is</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.220" end="00:25:00.370" style="s2">trying to capture the normativity of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.870" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">logos the way it draws us and compels us</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.370" end="00:25:05.210" style="s2">and how it calls us towards truth and</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:07.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s that that&#39;s what was good in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.210" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">the logic I get that but something is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.400" end="00:25:11.720" style="s2">being lost what you called I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:14.060" style="s2">perhaps the mystery but what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.720" end="00:25:16.490" style="s2">say is this their sense of right</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.060" end="00:25:19.790" style="s2">participating in something right that</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.490" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">takes on a life of its own but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.790" end="00:25:23.270" style="s2">agape that&#39;s why the Christians linked</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:25.340" style="s2">them is so readily agape and logos</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.270" end="00:25:27.020" style="s2">because it precedes us even though it</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.340" end="00:25:27.970" style="s2">seems to take on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.020" end="00:25:30.140" style="s2">between us</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.970" end="00:25:32.300" style="s2">like you said Sooners were in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.140" end="00:25:34.820" style="s2">recognition of it we we recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.300" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">it has preceded us and grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.820" end="00:25:42.740" style="s2">afforded that very you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:44.360" style="s2">very I don&#39;t that emergence yes sorry</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.740" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">that was that was a bit of a speech but</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.360" end="00:25:47.960" style="s2">there&#39;s so much going on there that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:50.510" style="s2">trying like this is what I was diving</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.960" end="00:25:52.520" style="s2">deeply into right now as I work on the I</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.510" end="00:25:54.500" style="s2">work on the next series that I really</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.520" end="00:25:57.500" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to understand all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.500" end="00:25:59.990" style="s2">dimensions of dialogue and dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.500" end="00:26:01.430" style="s2">you know the differences that came after</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.990" end="00:26:04.040" style="s2">and all that just I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.430" end="00:26:06.050" style="s2">and I see like when I saw the two talks</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.040" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">do your two talks recently the one you</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.050" end="00:26:10.160" style="s2">had with Chris and the one you had with</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:11.990" style="s2">Jordan Hall both of those were like ah</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.160" end="00:26:14.710" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff going on there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.990" end="00:26:17.960" style="s2">stuff going on there and you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.710" end="00:26:18.560" style="s2">like what I want it like what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.960" end="00:26:22.430" style="s2">to get at</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.560" end="00:26:24.050" style="s2">yeah is is there&#39;s something here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.430" end="00:26:26.450" style="s2">with like with what you&#39;re doing with</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.050" end="00:26:29.930" style="s2">the circling and then and and but and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.450" end="00:26:32.990" style="s2">want to see how how is that because this</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.930" end="00:26:35.690" style="s2">is our challenge how do we get back sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.990" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">of what Aristotle rightfully found but</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.690" end="00:26:42.770" style="s2">perhaps a little bit I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:46.880" style="s2">mistakenly extricated from but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.770" end="00:26:48.350" style="s2">bring back into yeah the circling the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.880" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">argumentation in the Phil</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.350" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">Safa consent how can we do philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:55.960" style="s2">together right with the circling so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.460" style="s2">dialogue becomes the dialectic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.960" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.460" end="00:27:02.600" style="s2">how do how do we get them to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:04.220" style="s2">each other because it&#39;s not a simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.600" end="00:27:06.110" style="s2">case of well here&#39;s its essence and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:07.549" style="s2">here&#39;s its essence and I just stick them</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.110" end="00:27:10.929" style="s2">together because that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.549" end="00:27:13.820" style="s2">would be thwarted right but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.929" end="00:27:16.160" style="s2">see you see I&#39;m gesturing in this grass</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.820" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">being reaching fashion but you know can</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.160" end="00:27:20.150" style="s2">I can we bring in the argumentation back</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:21.950" style="s2">and I see people my good friend Peter</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.150" end="00:27:24.169" style="s2">Lambert trying to do this right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.950" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">trying to get like with his ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.169" end="00:27:28.039" style="s2">the anti debate and stuff like that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:30.260" style="s2">trying to say can we get something like</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.039" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">the authentic relating and the argument</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:34.490" style="s2">patient should have back together again</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:36.620" style="s2">so they&#39;re mutually facilitating and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.490" end="00:27:38.299" style="s2">affording each other and I see this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.620" end="00:27:39.860" style="s2">this is the core of the project that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.299" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">trying to that I&#39;m wrestling with right</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.860" end="00:27:47.960" style="s2">now right so that though I so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:49.850" style="s2">part of the pot like part part of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.020" end="00:28:58.429" style="s2">hope it&#39;s like you know from the Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.360" end="00:28:59.960" style="s2">mythology we were able to churn the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.429" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">cosmic milk into butter or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.960" end="00:29:03.309" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:05.539" style="s2">I mean it feels it doesn&#39;t feel</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.539" end="00:29:10.059" style="s2">happening at me right now and the work</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.830" end="00:29:16.309" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and the residence I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.059" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">and I see again like I watched a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.309" end="00:29:24.620" style="s2">good discussion between David fuller</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:26.929" style="s2">David Thornton and Mike I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.620" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">Michaels name future yeah from the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.929" end="00:29:33.559" style="s2">beater yeah and and they&#39;re really in</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:35.929" style="s2">there they&#39;re doing something sorry this</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.559" end="00:29:37.880" style="s2">work sounds dismissive and it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.929" end="00:29:39.230" style="s2">please charity on this word they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.880" end="00:29:41.360" style="s2">trying to do something we&#39;re practical</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.230" end="00:29:43.669" style="s2">right right in that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">figure out they feel the pulse of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.669" end="00:29:48.169" style="s2">change and that there&#39;s they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.980" end="00:29:50.990" style="s2">to figure out the practices that will</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.169" end="00:29:53.720" style="s2">catch the current the Kairos of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.990" end="00:29:55.429" style="s2">change and hopefully tap into it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.720" end="00:29:58.100" style="s2">afford it that they see happening in</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.429" end="00:29:59.899" style="s2">discourse and dialogue and and it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.100" end="00:30:02.360" style="s2">like I say I feel that the project I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.899" end="00:30:04.130" style="s2">engaged in right now is so resonant that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.360" end="00:30:06.139" style="s2">with what they&#39;re talking about I feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.130" end="00:30:07.760" style="s2">like I feel a kind of an urgency to it</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.139" end="00:30:10.549" style="s2">precisely because of that it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.760" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">this this is this is the Kairos this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.549" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:19.429" style="s2">you know more articulation both in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:21.769" style="s2">sense of linguistic art in theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.429" end="00:30:25.480" style="s2">articulation but also articulation in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.769" end="00:30:27.950" style="s2">our actions in our practices we need to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.480" end="00:30:30.950" style="s2">well we need to keep moving both of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.950" end="00:30:34.279" style="s2">those forward together and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:36.740" style="s2">is very exciting and like I said well</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.279" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">you and I are both talking to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.740" end="00:30:40.909" style="s2">Jordan Hall is trying to put together</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:43.370" style="s2">get more more of us talking together and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.909" end="00:30:46.299" style="s2">working on trying to understand this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.370" end="00:30:48.980" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s all very exciting but to see</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.299" end="00:30:50.510" style="s2">these you know I include you in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.980" end="00:30:52.370" style="s2">right and I try to include you as much</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.510" end="00:30:54.409" style="s2">as I can and this product you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.370" end="00:30:56.750" style="s2">valuable and important to it but all</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.409" end="00:30:58.850" style="s2">these people have tremendous talent and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.750" end="00:31:01.669" style="s2">expertise and depth you know coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.850" end="00:31:04.130" style="s2">together and really trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.669" end="00:31:06.200" style="s2">do that it sounds so simple but do the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.130" end="00:31:07.399" style="s2">thing you&#39;re pointing to they they want</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.200" end="00:31:11.090" style="s2">to get to the point where they can step</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.399" end="00:31:13.720" style="s2">back and somehow articulate and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.090" end="00:31:15.550" style="s2">Abe in the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.720" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">sense of naming what it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.550" end="00:31:21.250" style="s2">doing right now yes right what is what</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:23.050" style="s2">we&#39;re all wrestling with something right</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.250" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re all wrestling profoundly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.050" end="00:31:27.310" style="s2">people what is it what is it what is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:30.250" style="s2">and we keep asking this and we should</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.310" end="00:31:31.960" style="s2">keep asking it right and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.250" end="00:31:35.670" style="s2">in which and this is where we really got</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.960" end="00:31:38.230" style="s2">to you in the conversation with with</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.670" end="00:31:42.160" style="s2">with Jordan Hall the one that I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.230" end="00:31:47.140" style="s2">with him so far this omote where it we</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.160" end="00:31:48.970" style="s2">felt so in the tension of at least I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.140" end="00:31:51.730" style="s2">very I think both of us were very</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.970" end="00:31:57.130" style="s2">present to this recognition of to name</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.730" end="00:31:59.260" style="s2">it in a certain sense in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.130" end="00:32:02.470" style="s2">it that it was there&#39;s a danger in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.260" end="00:32:05.740" style="s2">naming it that it could go into that yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.470" end="00:32:08.710" style="s2">yes hate the logic if you will the logic</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.740" end="00:32:10.660" style="s2">the logos just that awareness of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.710" end="00:32:13.000" style="s2">danger and it was just really great</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.660" end="00:32:15.400" style="s2">being with him both of us being ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.000" end="00:32:18.330" style="s2">increasingly aware of that danger but</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.400" end="00:32:23.770" style="s2">Sunday dancing with it in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.330" end="00:32:27.730" style="s2">that that that awareness itself allowed</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.770" end="00:32:29.830" style="s2">it to be it to emerge right like so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.730" end="00:32:32.770" style="s2">something something about what Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.830" end="00:32:34.690" style="s2">maybe because this thought is of all all</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.770" end="00:32:37.870" style="s2">the things I&#39;ve ever read of Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.690" end="00:32:41.250" style="s2">um I&#39;m sorry let me just turn this off</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.870" end="00:32:43.870" style="s2">here so we can not be disturbed by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.250" end="00:32:50.050" style="s2">social media hang on one second do not</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.870" end="00:32:52.990" style="s2">disturb okay yeah so there&#39;s this just</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.050" end="00:32:55.210" style="s2">this sense of of where we&#39;re I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.990" end="00:32:56.890" style="s2">Heidegger talked about this one thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.210" end="00:32:59.620" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking about for 20</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.890" end="00:33:05.680" style="s2">years since I&#39;ve been reading him which</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.620" end="00:33:09.100" style="s2">is where he he frames where he&#39;s framing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.680" end="00:33:12.280" style="s2">a lecture he&#39;s about to give and I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.100" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like for the death of Heisenberg or</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.280" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">or some assists or something and he and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">he starts off the lecture and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:22.930" style="s2">about that you know perhaps we should</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:25.950" style="s2">want to listen to the to the work of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.930" end="00:33:27.730" style="s2">person who were celebrating their deaths</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.950" end="00:33:29.530" style="s2">over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.730" end="00:33:32.500" style="s2">again and and and it would be wise for</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.530" end="00:33:35.680" style="s2">us not to to demand immediate</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.500" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">intelligibility right very much right</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.680" end="00:33:41.170" style="s2">like if the painter was here right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.710" end="00:33:43.570" style="s2">and we were standing before the work</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.170" end="00:33:45.370" style="s2">like his painting like with him we</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.570" end="00:33:48.280" style="s2">should want to look at it for a long</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.370" end="00:33:50.440" style="s2">time and still not demand that it be</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.280" end="00:33:52.150" style="s2">immediately intelligible us and he kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.440" end="00:33:54.550" style="s2">of goes through these things in which it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.150" end="00:33:58.930" style="s2">highlights a kind of obviousness where</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.550" end="00:34:01.420" style="s2">it seems so sensible to to have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.930" end="00:34:04.390" style="s2">sensible response and not having that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.420" end="00:34:06.450" style="s2">demand which are few like we start we we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.390" end="00:34:09.310" style="s2">have a we have a listening that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.450" end="00:34:10.900" style="s2">isn&#39;t apt to listen to the world that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.310" end="00:34:13.480" style="s2">way most of the time but there&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.900" end="00:34:15.370" style="s2">few places right and then he then he</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.480" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">brings it into philosophy which is this</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.370" end="00:34:19.990" style="s2">world right which is like we not so with</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:22.990" style="s2">philosophy you know we seem to demand</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.990" end="00:34:25.390" style="s2">that it be immediately graspable and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.990" end="00:34:28.240" style="s2">even in service of giving us the good</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.390" end="00:34:30.760" style="s2">life right and then ago tonight he says</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.240" end="00:34:34.420" style="s2">like perhaps philosophy is speaking to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.760" end="00:34:38.140" style="s2">that that which is both determinate to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.420" end="00:34:41.410" style="s2">the philosopher the poet and and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.140" end="00:34:43.120" style="s2">scientist which is to realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.410" end="00:34:46.600" style="s2">question of being is still not yet</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.120" end="00:34:48.850" style="s2">articulated right and he goes he goes on</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.600" end="00:34:51.790" style="s2">okay now let me give you a hint on how</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.850" end="00:34:54.660" style="s2">to listen to the lecture which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.790" end="00:34:58.810" style="s2">interesting just in itself that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.660" end="00:35:01.630" style="s2">ways that we listen first of all is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.810" end="00:35:05.170" style="s2">can be mind-boggling when you really</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.630" end="00:35:07.590" style="s2">look at it and it says instead of</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.170" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">listening to a series of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.590" end="00:35:16.150" style="s2">perhaps we can follow the movement I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:18.460" style="s2">showing yes I think that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.150" end="00:35:19.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a very important thing so a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.460" end="00:35:22.650" style="s2">couple things I want to say in response</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.780" end="00:35:25.720" style="s2">first of all when you talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.650" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">question that you&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.720" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">for twenty years abroad a deep smile to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:32.440" style="s2">my face because I think I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:32.830" style="s2">exemplifying I think what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.440" end="00:35:35.230" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.830" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">the ability to stay with something which</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.230" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s a way you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:41.830" style="s2">misunderstand that and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:43.660" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.830" end="00:35:46.150" style="s2">of what you&#39;re in which people say</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.660" end="00:35:47.710" style="s2">people can confuse staying with</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.150" end="00:35:49.240" style="s2">something like whether you stay in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.710" end="00:35:50.980" style="s2">relationship and think about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.240" end="00:35:54.760" style="s2">always that danger and you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.980" end="00:35:56.620" style="s2">demand too much intelligibility yes too</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.760" end="00:35:58.300" style="s2">fast from your partner right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.620" end="00:36:01.060" style="s2">that there&#39;s that okay so think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.300" end="00:36:02.680" style="s2">not confusing staying with something</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.060" end="00:36:04.840" style="s2">with being stuck because those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.680" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">the same being stuck is like when you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.840" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">you have that all right there&#39;s the lock</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.990" style="s2">and you can&#39;t move and there&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.260" end="00:36:13.030" style="s2">whereas that when you&#39;re staying with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.990" end="00:36:15.460" style="s2">something it&#39;s not so much you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.030" end="00:36:18.220" style="s2">not maybe questioning is the wrong weird</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.460" end="00:36:20.350" style="s2">is more like questing right that what</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.220" end="00:36:22.410" style="s2">you&#39;re staying with it you&#39;re staying in</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.350" end="00:36:24.790" style="s2">the question you&#39;re staying with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.410" end="00:36:29.200" style="s2">more and more more and more happens</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.790" end="00:36:32.080" style="s2">right like it and I only mean this fine</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:34.900" style="s2">analogy but again you get into a central</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.080" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">partnership with the phenomenon that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.900" end="00:36:43.540" style="s2">have with with with my partner yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:44.920" style="s2">it&#39;s so there there&#39;s people can&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.540" end="00:36:47.410" style="s2">and this is one of the great mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.920" end="00:36:50.680" style="s2">when people look at philosophies is well</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.410" end="00:36:52.540" style="s2">you know because yes start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.680" end="00:36:53.950" style="s2">this stuff for hundreds of years well</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.540" end="00:36:56.140" style="s2">you know and you&#39;re so slow and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.950" end="00:37:00.490" style="s2">like well some problems take centuries</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.140" end="00:37:07.030" style="s2">to discuss and and some relationships</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.490" end="00:37:09.340" style="s2">take years real years before you start</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.030" end="00:37:12.580" style="s2">to get a sense of what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.340" end="00:37:15.220" style="s2">them and it&#39;s you know and and and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.580" end="00:37:16.660" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s what Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.220" end="00:37:18.250" style="s2">pointing to and it&#39;s the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.660" end="00:37:19.540" style="s2">Plato Plato in the seventh letter says</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.250" end="00:37:21.220" style="s2">you know you read all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.540" end="00:37:24.520" style="s2">including his own work he says but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.220" end="00:37:28.300" style="s2">have to live with somebody for a long</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.520" end="00:37:30.010" style="s2">time until the spark and there you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.300" end="00:37:32.140" style="s2">make it you have to make yourself</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.010" end="00:37:36.310" style="s2">receptive to it until the spark catches</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.140" end="00:37:38.020" style="s2">between two people and then then he says</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.310" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">then you&#39;ll understand my philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.020" end="00:37:45.250" style="s2">yeah and I think that dwelling with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">we find when we stay with somebody in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.250" end="00:37:51.100" style="s2">partnership that&#39;s not if that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.400" end="00:37:52.280" style="s2">dry barren stuckness but is actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.100" end="00:37:55.400" style="s2">this fecund</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.280" end="00:37:57.980" style="s2">oh I think that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.400" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">talk about and and and and the trick of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.980" end="00:38:04.670" style="s2">it is for me I guess is I mean I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.740" style="s2">educator and I&#39;m a scientist so I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.670" end="00:38:08.690" style="s2">to try and bring theoretical clarity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:11.780" style="s2">this topic that I want to discuss that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.690" end="00:38:14.270" style="s2">part of what I have to do yeah and I but</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.780" end="00:38:15.980" style="s2">and I have to do it right but so I have</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.270" end="00:38:18.350" style="s2">I have a sitch I haven&#39;t I have a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.980" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">condition on me that you don&#39;t face when</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.350" end="00:38:24.950" style="s2">you&#39;re encircling yeah in that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:26.630" style="s2">in addition to you know yeah fully</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.950" end="00:38:28.580" style="s2">participating in it and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.630" end="00:38:30.260" style="s2">I&#39;m joining a circling group and things</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.580" end="00:38:32.030" style="s2">like that and doing these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.260" end="00:38:35.390" style="s2">conversations with you and Jordan for</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.030" end="00:38:38.240" style="s2">example and Chris yeah but in addition</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.390" end="00:38:40.040" style="s2">to that I also have to try and I have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.240" end="00:38:42.350" style="s2">bring a theoretical articulation to it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.040" end="00:38:44.540" style="s2">that isn&#39;t actually properly part of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.350" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">but nevertheless has to be wedded to it</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.540" end="00:38:49.370" style="s2">in the appropriate manner yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:51.830" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.370" end="00:38:55.010" style="s2">tricky thing like we people are craving</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.830" end="00:38:57.260" style="s2">a language like often say it like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.010" end="00:38:59.900" style="s2">vocabulary grammar to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.260" end="00:39:02.690" style="s2">one what is it we&#39;re doing this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.900" end="00:39:05.060" style="s2">deal logos dialectic you know this this</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.690" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">transformative discourse within you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.060" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">distributed cognition what is it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:13.910" style="s2">doing how does it work right right it</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.560" style="s2">and and and I&#39;m very I&#39;m very sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.910" end="00:39:17.480" style="s2">to your concern and that&#39;s why I use the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.560" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">biblical sense of naming we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.480" end="00:39:21.410" style="s2">to name it in an idolatrous fashion we</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:23.060" style="s2">don&#39;t want to name it such that we think</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.410" end="00:39:26.180" style="s2">that by maybe if we can summon it at</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.060" end="00:39:27.920" style="s2">will yes right but at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:30.710" style="s2">again we don&#39;t want to have a premature</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.920" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">intelligibility but on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.710" end="00:39:35.590" style="s2">don&#39;t want to leave people bereft right</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:39.980" style="s2">that&#39;s thanks that&#39;s that&#39;s the trick</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.590" end="00:39:42.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the trick so that so right there</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.980" end="00:39:47.120" style="s2">just even like that you use that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.130" end="00:39:50.180" style="s2">yeah metaphor trick trickster right</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.120" end="00:39:52.670" style="s2">herim playfulness yeah romantic right</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.180" end="00:39:56.330" style="s2">good quality of like in what I what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.670" end="00:39:58.940" style="s2">interesting about Burmese myth</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.330" end="00:40:01.430" style="s2">mythically so hermes is that my</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.940" end="00:40:03.980" style="s2">understanding is the God that is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.430" end="00:40:05.840" style="s2">not he&#39;s not totally a God and he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.980" end="00:40:08.570" style="s2">totally human</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.840" end="00:40:10.940" style="s2">so he&#39;s he&#39;s not he&#39;s he&#39;s the one with</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.570" end="00:40:14.420" style="s2">the wings on it on on the ankles and on</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.940" end="00:40:17.750" style="s2">the head right so Hermes is like her met</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.420" end="00:40:20.950" style="s2">her munetaka phenomenology is this place</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.750" end="00:40:24.530" style="s2">it is it doesn&#39;t totally go above weds</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.950" end="00:40:26.990" style="s2">yeah and isn&#39;t wedded at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.530" end="00:40:29.450" style="s2">and transcends both earth and heaven</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.990" end="00:40:32.150" style="s2">right yes yes in this way this</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.450" end="00:40:34.010" style="s2">in-between way which is Oh like he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.150" end="00:40:35.510" style="s2">vehicle for transformation continually</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.010" end="00:40:37.310" style="s2">right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.510" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">and in what&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.310" end="00:40:41.480" style="s2">Hermes and I I heard this I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:42.770" style="s2">through through Hillman although I</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.480" end="00:40:44.360" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to find it in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.770" end="00:40:46.370" style="s2">actual myth so I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.360" end="00:40:52.760" style="s2">actually true but it makes sense if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.370" end="00:40:55.670" style="s2">is which is where Hermes has been wedded</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.760" end="00:41:00.380" style="s2">to is Hestia which is the goddess of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.670" end="00:41:02.450" style="s2">Dumas domesticity that Hillman kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.380" end="00:41:05.810" style="s2">draws up psychologically this is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.450" end="00:41:07.910" style="s2">but when Hermes when when Hermes isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.810" end="00:41:11.000" style="s2">in its in its right place it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.910" end="00:41:14.170" style="s2">manic in a Devoy it becomes divorced of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.000" end="00:41:16.670" style="s2">Hestia where Hermes is just this forever</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.170" end="00:41:19.310" style="s2">which I think you could say some would</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.670" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">say is like post-modernism right in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.310" end="00:41:23.890" style="s2">in that sense of the word just the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">spinning off of like forever</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.890" end="00:41:29.530" style="s2">interpretations but with no sense of any</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">ground or recognition of ground that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.530" end="00:41:40.660" style="s2">that the sense of home and domesticity</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.650" end="00:41:43.160" style="s2">of regularity of I think and right</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.660" end="00:41:45.290" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.160" end="00:41:49.220" style="s2">hope the myth is true yeah you cut</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.290" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">because I mean I think part of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.220" end="00:41:54.500" style="s2">Chris and I argue this in the book and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:57.290" style="s2">argued it in a series I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.500" end="00:41:59.360" style="s2">what sacredness is is to have again what</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.290" end="00:42:02.570" style="s2">at this top toe knows there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.360" end="00:42:04.130" style="s2">existential tension between that which</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.570" end="00:42:05.960" style="s2">homes us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.130" end="00:42:08.450" style="s2">and that which exposes us to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.960" end="00:42:10.870" style="s2">numinous the sacred right is that which</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.450" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">the experience of sacredness is to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.870" end="00:42:16.010" style="s2">constantly you know in tension between</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:18.530" style="s2">these because I think that that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.010" end="00:42:19.340" style="s2">of the that sort of powerful higher</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.530" end="00:42:20.870" style="s2">order elements</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.340" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">realization you&#39;ve got the part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.870" end="00:42:26.900" style="s2">assimilating right and Strack ting what</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:28.460" style="s2">can be held as invariant but you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.900" end="00:42:30.200" style="s2">the part that&#39;s constantly varying</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.460" end="00:42:32.930" style="s2">opening you up to the numinous the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.200" end="00:42:36.170" style="s2">unexpected and and and and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.930" end="00:42:38.390" style="s2">like Hermes and Hestia right but many of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.170" end="00:42:40.690" style="s2">our sacred symbols they have this polar</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.390" end="00:42:43.580" style="s2">tension within them precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.690" end="00:42:46.490" style="s2">right there you know they&#39;re know they</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.580" end="00:42:48.470" style="s2">they home no think of Zeus Zeus you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.490" end="00:42:50.300" style="s2">he defeats the monsters with his</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.470" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">lightning bolt in homes the world for</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.300" end="00:42:54.410" style="s2">mankind but he&#39;s also the capricious</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.790" style="s2">deity that can suddenly loose the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.410" end="00:42:58.580" style="s2">lightning bolt at you right</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.790" end="00:43:01.340" style="s2">so the numinous and and and the homing</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.580" end="00:43:03.110" style="s2">are always there it reminds me of a line</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.340" end="00:43:05.450" style="s2">from CS Lewis Paul Van Dyck they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.110" end="00:43:10.130" style="s2">like this where where the children are</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.450" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">talking about ozland hmm and and one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.130" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">the kids says well is it is he tame and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">they go oh goodness no he&#39;s not tamed</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:22.280" style="s2">but he&#39;s good all right he&#39;s numinous</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:24.950" style="s2">he&#39;s not tamed but there&#39;s a part but</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.280" end="00:43:26.540" style="s2">he&#39;s good he contributes to the homing</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.950" end="00:43:28.790" style="s2">there&#39;s the two are always there</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.540" end="00:43:31.100" style="s2">together and this is exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.790" end="00:43:34.850" style="s2">trying to get is like I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.100" end="00:43:38.390" style="s2">about this right right in a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.850" end="00:43:39.980" style="s2">you know I one of the ways here that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:40.400" style="s2">what I want to say sorry you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.980" end="00:43:42.050" style="s2">me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.400" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2">one of the ways in which we could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.050" end="00:43:46.220" style="s2">premature in our we could we could we</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.840" end="00:43:48.230" style="s2">could grasp that premature</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.220" end="00:43:51.950" style="s2">intelligibility would be to simply try</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.230" end="00:43:54.920" style="s2">to resolve the tension yeah with some</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.950" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">kind of Pat definition or method some</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.920" end="00:43:59.690" style="s2">algorithmic rule or procedure alright</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:00.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s not what you need to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.690" end="00:44:03.950" style="s2">the theory the theory needs to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.920" end="00:44:06.710" style="s2">articulate the tension so that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.950" end="00:44:11.090" style="s2">creatively participated into its depths</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.710" end="00:44:13.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for yeah what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.090" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">it like just to what I heard you said</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.700" end="00:44:19.700" style="s2">when he said yeah oh you&#39;re helping me</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:22.940" style="s2">here particulate right like what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.700" end="00:44:25.790" style="s2">just like having just articulated it</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.940" end="00:44:27.980" style="s2">your project it felt like a path opened</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.790" end="00:44:30.290" style="s2">up yeah that&#39;s exactly like from my</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.980" end="00:44:31.610" style="s2">chest a path opened up it and you and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.290" end="00:44:33.050" style="s2">are together on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.610" end="00:44:36.140" style="s2">right that&#39;s what it felt like it felt</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.050" end="00:44:38.990" style="s2">like that that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.140" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">that when you talked about that tension</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.990" end="00:44:48.200" style="s2">hold articulate it right to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:50.330" style="s2">the attention the question the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.200" end="00:44:52.700" style="s2">right and also what you talked about I</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.330" end="00:44:56.210" style="s2">really I really felt at the moment you</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.700" end="00:44:58.490" style="s2">said it was yeah there&#39;s the coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.210" end="00:45:01.970" style="s2">coming at this from as a professor and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.490" end="00:45:07.220" style="s2">scientist right my job right very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.970" end="00:45:09.170" style="s2">you is almost in some ways is is almost</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.220" end="00:45:11.150" style="s2">never attainable but you found a what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.170" end="00:45:14.030" style="s2">thing I&#39;m appreciating and I think so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.150" end="00:45:17.390" style="s2">many people so deeply appreciate about</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.030" end="00:45:20.270" style="s2">you right and both about you personally</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.390" end="00:45:27.770" style="s2">and also what comes through you right is</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.270" end="00:45:30.170" style="s2">this this deep fidelity right to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.770" end="00:45:31.970" style="s2">as you talked about is a lot is to face</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.170" end="00:45:35.600" style="s2">the mystery and really look at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.970" end="00:45:39.350" style="s2">mystery and be technical technically</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.600" end="00:45:43.370" style="s2">precise while not solving the mystery as</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.350" end="00:45:44.990" style="s2">it right but to articulate the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.370" end="00:45:47.720" style="s2">in such a way that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.990" end="00:45:51.890" style="s2">more and more intelligently involved in</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.720" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">it right and right which is under singer</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.890" end="00:46:00.620" style="s2">I think I I think I just appreciated it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:46:02.540" style="s2">like in a big way I like more than I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.620" end="00:46:03.980" style="s2">have before more than I and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.540" end="00:46:06.980" style="s2">did before but there&#39;s a way to just</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.980" end="00:46:11.930" style="s2">really hit me in that moment of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.980" end="00:46:14.870" style="s2">like not only not only are you up to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.930" end="00:46:16.990" style="s2">task that many of us have been up to it</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.870" end="00:46:19.790" style="s2">but there it is it there is actually um</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.990" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at subjects where you</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.790" end="00:46:25.890" style="s2">have a lot of scrutiny</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:30.120" style="s2">right or at least a history of a gaze of</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.890" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">scrutiny for technical decision on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.120" end="00:46:37.770" style="s2">very thing that demands ray it not be</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.790" style="s2">concealed in that precision it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.770" end="00:46:45.540" style="s2">think I just really felt there the risk</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.790" end="00:46:47.610" style="s2">there is beauty that&#39;s doing if there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.540" end="00:46:50.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s why the word you use fidelity</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.610" end="00:46:52.890" style="s2">really rang with me that was a very alia</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.570" end="00:46:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a really really appropriate word</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.890" end="00:47:03.240" style="s2">really saying to what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.880" end="00:47:06.660" style="s2">here yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.240" end="00:47:08.790" style="s2">carefulness right which it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.660" end="00:47:10.680" style="s2">not a confusion of words you want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.790" end="00:47:12.780" style="s2">avoid it&#39;s a confusion of modes of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.680" end="00:47:15.840" style="s2">intelligibility right there&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.780" end="00:47:17.790" style="s2">there there&#39;s theorizing and it has its</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.840" end="00:47:19.620" style="s2">role in its place and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.790" end="00:47:25.140" style="s2">different from actually undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.620" end="00:47:27.960" style="s2">transformation and so I try to I try to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.140" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">help myself and help the people that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.960" end="00:47:34.320" style="s2">teaching or talking with to try and not</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:36.120" style="s2">confuse them together I often say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.320" end="00:47:37.500" style="s2">confuse properties of your theory with</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.120" end="00:47:39.950" style="s2">properties of what your theories about</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.500" end="00:47:42.990" style="s2">and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.950" end="00:47:46.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s that that&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.990" end="00:47:48.630" style="s2">responsibility that we need to pay much</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.260" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">more careful attention to I think just</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.630" end="00:47:52.710" style="s2">generally everybody needs to pay much</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:55.350" style="s2">more careful attention to not engaging</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.710" end="00:47:59.670" style="s2">in that kind of confusion not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.350" end="00:48:03.120" style="s2">that your mode of intelligibility is has</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.670" end="00:48:04.590" style="s2">to be the same right as to share the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.120" end="00:48:08.100" style="s2">properties with the thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.590" end="00:48:10.110" style="s2">about at all times and so that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.100" end="00:48:11.130" style="s2">very tricky thing so I mean you want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.110" end="00:48:12.840" style="s2">write this freaked out one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.130" end="00:48:15.030" style="s2">examples I uses sometimes you need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.840" end="00:48:17.610" style="s2">write really clear prose about the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.030" end="00:48:19.260" style="s2">deepest poetry and that&#39;s and and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.610" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">will not do a good job if you just write</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.260" end="00:48:23.400" style="s2">another poem because you&#39;ll just defer</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:25.260" style="s2">people in their attempts to understand</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.400" end="00:48:27.960" style="s2">poetry but on the other hand you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.260" end="00:48:28.260" style="s2">just make it a dry analysis right you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.960" end="00:48:29.730" style="s2">got it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.260" end="00:48:32.520" style="s2">you got to do it&#39;s got to have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.730" end="00:48:34.980" style="s2">clarity that nevertheless evokes alright</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.520" end="00:48:36.150" style="s2">it calls out it gets right it&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.980" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.150" end="00:48:41.069" style="s2">nation ship with the poem that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:43.319" style="s2">how the analogy I used in my mind</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.500" end="00:49:44.579" style="s2">metaphors right again about you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.599" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">because taste is the is the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.579" end="00:49:52.349" style="s2">weds us to something yeah yeah taste and</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:56.010" style="s2">wetness so so there&#39;s also a quality in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.349" end="00:49:58.890" style="s2">taste here is that the ad there is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.010" end="00:50:05.579" style="s2">quality where someone who has good taste</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.890" end="00:50:06.539" style="s2">seems to be the taste is defined being</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.579" end="00:50:09.480" style="s2">of taste</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.539" end="00:50:12.599" style="s2">having taste seems to be defined in what</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.480" end="00:50:14.609" style="s2">it is impregnated in its absence right</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.599" end="00:50:18.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s like when someone who has good</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.609" end="00:50:21.079" style="s2">taste it seems to me versus someone who</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.390" end="00:50:24.089" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a good taste right is</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.079" end="00:50:26.730" style="s2">they&#39;ll come to a to a situation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.089" end="00:50:31.079" style="s2">they&#39;ll be able to draw out and be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.730" end="00:50:32.609" style="s2">impregnated by yes yes rightly all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.079" end="00:50:34.230" style="s2">the multiple relations that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.609" end="00:50:37.589" style="s2">available versus someone who doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.589" end="00:50:41.970" style="s2">impregnated by so it&#39;s I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.900" end="00:50:45.779" style="s2">hearing you say is this is it is it fair</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.970" end="00:50:48.150" style="s2">to say that the theory in which calls</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.779" end="00:50:50.020" style="s2">that&#39;s called forth through the mystery</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.150" end="00:50:52.050" style="s2">that one sees or the poet</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.020" end="00:50:55.540" style="s2">right that writes the poem and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.050" end="00:50:57.100" style="s2">listening that can hear it that the list</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.540" end="00:50:59.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain way that like</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.100" end="00:51:03.190" style="s2">listening can call forth a theory that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.560" end="00:51:05.490" style="s2">is part of B being allowing one to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.190" end="00:51:09.430" style="s2">able to taste all the foods at the poet</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.490" end="00:51:10.630" style="s2">yeah hey think about the connoisseur and</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.430" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">notice how that&#39;s a French word for</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.630" end="00:51:15.580" style="s2">knowing right think about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:18.340" style="s2">connoisseur they they bring an</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.580" end="00:51:19.720" style="s2">articulate not just in thought they</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.340" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">haven&#39;t are right they big in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.720" end="00:51:24.850" style="s2">articulation at is a discerning ability</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:27.220" style="s2">to discriminate right between aspects</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.850" end="00:51:29.640" style="s2">and features and structures within what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.220" end="00:51:33.400" style="s2">they&#39;re tasting so the connoisseur right</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.640" end="00:51:36.369" style="s2">unfolds right but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.400" end="00:51:38.260" style="s2">the words can capture what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.369" end="00:51:41.050" style="s2">taste the wine you have to still taste</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.260" end="00:51:43.750" style="s2">the wine right what they do is they they</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.050" end="00:51:45.580" style="s2">write it this articulation like I said</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.750" end="00:51:47.530" style="s2">it&#39;s weighted and I like you were to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.580" end="00:51:50.619" style="s2">impregnate it&#39;s like it opens it up so</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.530" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">that the structure in the wine through</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.619" end="00:51:55.180" style="s2">the experience of the taste actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:57.609" style="s2">transforms you know our perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.180" end="00:51:59.350" style="s2">knowing in a deep well and I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.609" end="00:52:03.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.350" end="00:52:06.310" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to do you know I with</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.160" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">my series it&#39;s like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.310" end="00:52:13.390" style="s2">explain away that&#39;s not what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:15.609" style="s2">to do you know I&#39;m not I&#39;m critical of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.390" end="00:52:18.460" style="s2">kinds of musical positions and things</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.609" end="00:52:22.320" style="s2">like that but I do I very much want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.460" end="00:52:26.380" style="s2">try and like I said I want to give a</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.320" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">theory that that that bleeds into the--</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.380" end="00:52:31.060" style="s2">oriya right that the theater theory they</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.280" style="s2">the explanatory structure leaves you</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.060" end="00:52:35.380" style="s2">into the OREA in that sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">participatory contemplation of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.380" end="00:52:40.570" style="s2">Wow</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:42.280" style="s2">Furion well that&#39;s why I have the words</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.570" end="00:52:43.840" style="s2">on my tattooed on my leg I have a word</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.280" end="00:52:45.820" style="s2">that basically you know means sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.840" end="00:52:48.940" style="s2">theory and then into the-- oriya you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.820" end="00:52:51.010" style="s2">want it yeah i I&#39;ve succeeded if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.940" end="00:52:55.590" style="s2">led somebody through good theory into</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.010" end="00:52:58.600" style="s2">deep the OREA huh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.590" end="00:53:01.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my criterion of success</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.600" end="00:53:01.170" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:08.780" style="s2">I think I&#39;m I think you&#39;re leading me</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:11.000" style="s2">into the-- oriya right now we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.780" end="00:53:12.920" style="s2">it for each other I think yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.000" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">which is I would imagine as part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.920" end="00:53:19.880" style="s2">the-- oriya yes it is part of what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:23.240" style="s2">can&#39;t quite tell who&#39;s doing who - what</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.880" end="00:53:24.590" style="s2">right very much and so does one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.240" end="00:53:26.420" style="s2">things I&#39;m trying to explore what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.590" end="00:53:28.280" style="s2">relation because Don electic has these</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.420" end="00:53:30.590" style="s2">two meanings in the applauded tradition</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.280" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2">it means something done in dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.590" end="00:53:35.450" style="s2">people yeah but they&#39;re also it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">and and but it also connects to theoria</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.450" end="00:53:39.170" style="s2">and that it&#39;s also something you do with</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:41.300" style="s2">being you go through the Ann agog a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.170" end="00:53:43.250" style="s2">through dialectic as well so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.300" end="00:53:46.730" style="s2">deep connections between theoria and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.250" end="00:53:48.530" style="s2">deal logos I need to be unpacked and</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.730" end="00:53:49.790" style="s2">explored and that&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.530" end="00:53:52.220" style="s2">because there&#39;s like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.790" end="00:53:54.770" style="s2">horizontal and a vertical dimension to</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.220" end="00:53:56.780" style="s2">dialectic and they&#39;re always deeply</p>

<p begin="00:56:05.890" end="00:56:12.410" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s I mean Socrates said the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.550" end="00:56:14.360" style="s2">unexamined life is not worth living so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.410" end="00:56:16.760" style="s2">imagine yours to be very worth living</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:25.940" style="s2">Socratic emulation you&#39;re doing I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.340" end="00:56:29.870" style="s2">it&#39;s really really something to be</p>

<p begin="00:56:29.870" end="00:56:36.890" style="s2">very good now again no small part due to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.650" end="00:56:38.180" style="s2">people like Chris and to to Sarah I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.890" end="00:56:40.840" style="s2">said her name a couple times so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.180" end="00:56:43.780" style="s2">no sense trying to pretend I didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.840" end="00:56:46.310" style="s2">but you know for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.780" end="00:56:47.450" style="s2">it was the Nietzschean thing for me you</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.310" end="00:56:49.130" style="s2">know if you stare long enough into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.450" end="00:56:50.810" style="s2">abyss it starts to stare back because I</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.130" end="00:56:55.910" style="s2">was I was wrestling with the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.810" end="00:56:57.860" style="s2">crisis for a very long time and for and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.910" end="00:56:59.630" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s not meant to connote</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.860" end="00:57:01.370" style="s2">that I sort of solved it or something</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.630" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">like that I mean I&#39;m trying to give</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.370" end="00:57:05.780" style="s2">people ways of responding what I met was</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:08.710" style="s2">I was suffering the meaning crisis a</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.780" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">very long time in that it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.710" end="00:57:15.430" style="s2">undermining my agency in at times and</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:19.490" style="s2">powerful ways on and I think it it and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.430" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">and reflection and this as well and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.490" end="00:57:23.930" style="s2">apologized to this to my previous</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">partners I think it impacted negatively</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.930" end="00:57:27.970" style="s2">on my relationships I speak from</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:31.090" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.970" end="00:57:32.290" style="s2">when I say people can in that vampiric</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.090" end="00:57:34.800" style="s2">fashion try to draw from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.290" end="00:57:36.580" style="s2">relationships all that God and history</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.800" end="00:57:38.260" style="s2">try to do it and when you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.580" end="00:57:42.730" style="s2">depths of suffering the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.260" end="00:57:44.200" style="s2">that desire to draw from people can</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.730" end="00:57:47.080" style="s2">become and I did for me become</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.200" end="00:57:52.030" style="s2">inappropriate and too demanding I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.080" end="00:57:54.820" style="s2">it I think so I think was I was hard on</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.030" end="00:57:58.660" style="s2">people not I don&#39;t mean in a malicious</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.820" end="00:58:00.660" style="s2">way I wasn&#39;t hard-hearted but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.660" end="00:58:05.099" style="s2">was very hard to be around me</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.660" end="00:58:09.220" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve come to appreciate again</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.099" end="00:58:12.700" style="s2">what a gift it is to be with sorrow to</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.220" end="00:58:17.140" style="s2">have friends like Chris and because</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.700" end="00:58:19.510" style="s2">precisely because they&#39;ve to meet people</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.140" end="00:58:22.060" style="s2">like you because it&#39;s all part of for me</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.510" end="00:58:23.380" style="s2">a personal transformation when I&#39;m when</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.060" end="00:58:25.210" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about trying to help people</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.380" end="00:58:27.849" style="s2">awaken from the meeting crisis this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.210" end="00:58:32.650" style="s2">not just a theoretical thing I you</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.849" end="00:58:34.780" style="s2">Europe you&#39;re the best cut hey there hey</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.650" end="00:58:42.070" style="s2">what happened oh my</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.780" end="00:58:44.560" style="s2">cut my power went out like it flipped</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.070" end="00:58:47.790" style="s2">over the switch hey we were right oh my</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.560" end="00:58:50.830" style="s2">god you&#39;re right in a crescendo of uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.790" end="00:58:54.430" style="s2">well I just I that point is still with</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.830" end="00:58:57.369" style="s2">resonating with whatever to me it is as</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.430" end="00:58:58.810" style="s2">I was saying the best teaching is when</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.369" end="00:59:01.510" style="s2">you&#39;re sharing your ongoing learning</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.810" end="00:59:02.950" style="s2">with your students and when I&#39;m when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.510" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2">trying to teach about awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.950" end="00:59:07.510" style="s2">meeting crisis because I&#39;m going through</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.420" end="00:59:10.030" style="s2">this personally existentially alright</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.510" end="00:59:13.410" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s very present to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.030" end="00:59:21.010" style="s2">what what this is of what this means and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.410" end="00:59:22.750" style="s2">and so I want it&#39;s what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.010" end="00:59:25.030" style="s2">about I want all of the theoretical work</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.750" end="00:59:28.510" style="s2">I&#39;m doing and I&#39;m building this very</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.030" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">complex theoretical machine to use to</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.510" end="00:59:33.690" style="s2">use our metaphor to stay wedded to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:35.800" style="s2">process that I am currently within</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.690" end="00:59:38.710" style="s2">awakening for the meeting crisis and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.800" end="00:59:42.670" style="s2">seeing many people within and now</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.710" end="00:59:44.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do so to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.670" end="00:59:49.900" style="s2">back to the point it started of all this</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.470" end="00:59:54.609" style="s2">I you know I think now I have I have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.900" end="00:59:56.140" style="s2">very good life but I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.609" end="00:59:58.560" style="s2">want to disparage my life before but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.140" end="01:00:00.220" style="s2">think like I said I think I was hard on</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.560" end="01:00:04.570" style="s2">relationships and the people that</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.220" end="01:00:06.880" style="s2">related to me and again not maliciously</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.570" end="01:00:09.700" style="s2">I think I can be compassionate towards</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.880" end="01:00:11.020" style="s2">myself and say that but really we really</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.700" end="01:00:12.550" style="s2">like the Nietzschean thing really</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.020" end="01:00:13.810" style="s2">looking really deeply into the bits and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.550" end="01:00:16.780" style="s2">I think a lot of times it was looking</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.810" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">back out through me and people were like</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.780" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">oh you John is so dark so that was a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:29.400" style="s2">common way of talking about me</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:32.020" style="s2">and I don&#39;t feel so dark now and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.400" end="01:00:34.599" style="s2">the difference that&#39;s like what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.020" end="01:00:36.150" style="s2">difference such that what I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.599" end="01:00:40.780" style="s2">hearing you say is that you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.150" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">any less any less of the abyss that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.780" end="01:00:44.950" style="s2">right right in fact it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:49.150" style="s2">you&#39;re working you&#39;re looking at it even</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.950" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">more somehow yes but however something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.150" end="01:00:52.599" style="s2">different like what&#39;s the difference I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:55.390" style="s2">no longer stuck</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.599" end="01:00:58.089" style="s2">I&#39;m staying with it but I&#39;m no longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.390" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">stuck in it that&#39;s the big difference</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.089" end="01:01:04.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was trying to articulate</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:07.000" style="s2">earlier right there&#39;s a partnership in</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.630" end="01:01:08.920" style="s2">which and you know nishitani talks about</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.000" end="01:01:10.690" style="s2">this in religion and nothingness when</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.920" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">the no thingness goes from being the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.690" end="01:01:16.660" style="s2">stuckness the empty ended dead ending of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:19.990" style="s2">nihilism to the sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.660" end="01:01:22.570" style="s2">inexhaustible that you are the off with</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.990" end="01:01:24.060" style="s2">that&#39;s the difference that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.570" end="01:01:27.820" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.060" end="01:01:30.339" style="s2">Wow I just wanted I want to sit with</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.820" end="01:01:32.839" style="s2">that for a moment and really listen to</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.339" end="01:01:35.700" style="s2">what you just said</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.839" end="01:01:38.579" style="s2">because there&#39;s that you know as my</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.700" end="01:01:42.450" style="s2">understanding of the way that that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.579" end="01:01:45.720" style="s2">socrates listened to is Damon right yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.450" end="01:01:50.609" style="s2">right and listening in the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.720" end="01:01:54.829" style="s2">midwifery hey so I it&#39;s some way what</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.609" end="01:01:54.829" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing you say is like there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.369" end="01:01:59.430" style="s2">think personally we can all look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.660" end="01:02:01.290" style="s2">those points where we&#39;re were that which</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.430" end="01:02:05.250" style="s2">is feels like we&#39;re going through the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.290" end="01:02:06.990" style="s2">birth canal right only thing oxygen we</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.250" end="01:02:08.910" style="s2">don&#39;t remember time you know is there</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.990" end="01:02:11.099" style="s2">for that like the Suffocation&#39;s forever</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.910" end="01:02:13.020" style="s2">but there&#39;s something pulling us and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.099" end="01:02:14.760" style="s2">then there&#39;s those moments where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.020" end="01:02:18.329" style="s2">digesting where we&#39;re actually taking</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.760" end="01:02:20.520" style="s2">something in right where we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.329" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">more of the sense of the Midwife like</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.520" end="01:02:27.750" style="s2">midwifery it&#39;s yeah right so I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:29.579" style="s2">mean the point of just a feeling like</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.750" end="01:02:31.290" style="s2">we&#39;re in the presence of like midwifing</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.579" end="01:02:33.750" style="s2">something just like right now as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.290" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">kind of taking and my understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.750" end="01:02:41.339" style="s2">your life also is taking in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:44.369" style="s2">understanding of that dialectic dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.339" end="01:02:48.270" style="s2">oh s--- relationship itself like within</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.369" end="01:02:50.280" style="s2">your life I&#39;m also getting the logos at</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.270" end="01:02:54.920" style="s2">the same time and everything that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.280" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">talking to which is in some ways is</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.920" end="01:02:59.069" style="s2">characteristic of the phenomena that</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.549" style="s2">we&#39;re describing but also the phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.069" end="01:03:05.640" style="s2">we&#39;re in right now hi in this moment but</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.549" end="01:03:08.430" style="s2">also the moment that we&#39;re in where we</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.640" end="01:03:10.410" style="s2">get to have these conversations and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.430" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">get to witness these conversations in</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.410" end="01:03:15.930" style="s2">forming your work and revealing your</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:17.069" style="s2">work to you at the same time this is why</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.930" end="01:03:18.510" style="s2">I think when you talked when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.069" end="01:03:20.099" style="s2">texted me the other day there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.510" end="01:03:23.490" style="s2">certain moments we&#39;ve texted me and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.099" end="01:03:25.770" style="s2">can feel you in the integration it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.490" end="01:03:27.809" style="s2">like something is really emerging here</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.770" end="01:03:30.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t it do you feel it I&#39;m like yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.809" end="01:03:32.099" style="s2">totally feel it yeah I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.510" end="01:03:34.290" style="s2">starting to articulate more of what</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.099" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">we&#39;re I think that what you mean when</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.290" end="01:03:39.569" style="s2">you say that like I think so too I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:42.510" style="s2">it&#39;s very much like the Socratic project</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.569" end="01:03:43.980" style="s2">of trying to help something</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.510" end="01:03:46.170" style="s2">I&#39;ll give birth to something to</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.980" end="01:03:47.490" style="s2">participate in a birth you&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.170" end="01:03:49.320" style="s2">the child you&#39;re not merely receiving</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.490" end="01:03:52.109" style="s2">the child you&#39;re again you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.320" end="01:03:56.930" style="s2">invented in wedded and involved and a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.109" end="01:04:00.540" style="s2">mashed and the birthing of the child so</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.930" end="01:04:03.560" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very much that you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.540" end="01:04:09.840" style="s2">helping me in this dialogue to realize</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.560" end="01:04:12.570" style="s2">how deeply in formative of my what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.840" end="01:04:16.830" style="s2">doing right now my relationship to Sarah</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.570" end="01:04:21.030" style="s2">is like I did I was coming to see how</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.830" end="01:04:24.780" style="s2">deep of a template it is becoming for me</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.030" end="01:04:26.550" style="s2">in so many ways I hadn&#39;t I mean I had a</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.780" end="01:04:29.040" style="s2">sense of this is why I was I was using</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.550" end="01:04:32.609" style="s2">it as a metaphor but I I didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.040" end="01:04:37.619" style="s2">how deeply and how deep it went all</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.609" end="01:04:39.660" style="s2">right yeah that that&#39;s that thank you</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.619" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">for that that&#39;s been something it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.660" end="01:04:45.390" style="s2">of coming more clear in my mind now and</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:46.980" style="s2">so that this is something that I guess</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.390" end="01:04:49.410" style="s2">is also part of what you see in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.980" end="01:04:51.300" style="s2">Socratic dialectic and and and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.410" end="01:04:54.180" style="s2">people miss when they just extract the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.300" end="01:04:55.980" style="s2">propositional arguments Socrates has a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.180" end="01:04:59.100" style="s2">tremendous cookie this is connoted by</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.980" end="01:05:01.530" style="s2">the midwifery metaphor right he has a</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.100" end="01:05:02.940" style="s2">deep capacity to deeply know often</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.530" end="01:05:05.850" style="s2">better than they know themselves the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.940" end="01:05:08.670" style="s2">people he&#39;s talking with right and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.850" end="01:05:14.190" style="s2">so there&#39;s that there&#39;s that deep</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.670" end="01:05:18.300" style="s2">connectedness that drew Harlan talks</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.190" end="01:05:21.240" style="s2">about and his work on Socrates and I see</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.300" end="01:05:23.280" style="s2">that now there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s a relay</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.240" end="01:05:26.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep relationship between our</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.280" end="01:05:29.609" style="s2">ability to relate India logos and our</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.310" end="01:05:32.820" style="s2">ability to to connect deeply to other</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.609" end="01:05:34.619" style="s2">people and so that sounds so trivial to</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.820" end="01:05:37.500" style="s2">say I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.619" end="01:05:40.880" style="s2">articulate an insight right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.500" end="01:05:43.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which the the deep</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.880" end="01:05:46.230" style="s2">participation the deep conformity</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.230" end="01:05:52.230" style="s2">between two people that are you know off</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.230" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">together it grounds and develops the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.230" end="01:05:56.200" style="s2">grammar that we use when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">bring</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.200" end="01:06:00.700" style="s2">get up into like something like</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">philosophy yeah there&#39;s a there I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.700" end="01:06:06.369" style="s2">seen how deeply those those connections</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:08.050" style="s2">make sense what make sense what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.369" end="01:06:12.220" style="s2">saying well I don&#39;t let me see you I</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.050" end="01:06:13.690" style="s2">think my tears do feel like that like it</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.220" end="01:06:19.829" style="s2">or if you can see it like like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.690" end="01:06:22.210" style="s2">feeling move and I I I think it I felt I</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.829" end="01:06:26.140" style="s2">don&#39;t move throughout the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.210" end="01:06:27.970" style="s2">um I specifically when he felt moved</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.140" end="01:06:30.640" style="s2">when you when you brought it back to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.970" end="01:06:33.700" style="s2">very beginning of what we started to</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.640" end="01:06:35.410" style="s2">talk about where you went oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.700" end="01:06:39.430" style="s2">starting to see when you said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.410" end="01:06:42.670" style="s2">starting to see my relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.430" end="01:06:46.050" style="s2">sorrow like in what you talked about was</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.670" end="01:06:48.430" style="s2">you know that where we opened right was</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.050" end="01:06:50.589" style="s2">was where we were talking about yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.430" end="01:06:52.320" style="s2">what it seems like that there is there</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.589" end="01:06:55.180" style="s2">is seems to be some connection between</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.320" end="01:06:58.020" style="s2">the depth of my relationship with her</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.180" end="01:07:01.150" style="s2">and who I&#39;m coming to know her to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.020" end="01:07:03.730" style="s2">emulating him somehow that that</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.150" end="01:07:07.450" style="s2">connection being tapping into the in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.730" end="01:07:09.460" style="s2">inexhaustible intelligibility and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.450" end="01:07:11.589" style="s2">we went through this whole diet like</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.460" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">this whole ride right where we were</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.589" end="01:07:17.790" style="s2">talking about talking we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:22.569" style="s2">about talking and coming to terms in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.790" end="01:07:26.950" style="s2">the demand to come to terms in such a</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.569" end="01:07:29.530" style="s2">way that that&#39;s that evokes that comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.950" end="01:07:33.099" style="s2">that articulates the question that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.530" end="01:07:36.940" style="s2">engage when more deeply right and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.099" end="01:07:38.849" style="s2">unique the unique sense in your own</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.940" end="01:07:41.500" style="s2">personal life where that has been a</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.849" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">that&#39;s required you to look at the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.500" end="01:07:47.859" style="s2">abyss while having a sight like</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.839" end="01:07:50.650" style="s2">scientific demands that you bring it</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.859" end="01:07:52.000" style="s2">into technical firms but that unique</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.650" end="01:07:54.040" style="s2">relationship that you have as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.000" end="01:07:56.290" style="s2">professor as a teacher but also as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.040" end="01:07:58.390" style="s2">person but all the way up to this point</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.290" end="01:08:01.480" style="s2">where we&#39;re talking about the current</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.390" end="01:08:03.119" style="s2">conversation that we&#39;re in that brought</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.480" end="01:08:05.140" style="s2">it all together in this moment where you</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.119" end="01:08:07.780" style="s2">recognize the very thing that we were</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.140" end="01:08:09.460" style="s2">talking about in the beginning yeah all</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.780" end="01:08:09.950" style="s2">the way through your life so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.460" end="01:08:12.339" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.950" end="01:08:14.510" style="s2">like what kind of walking through</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.339" end="01:08:19.250" style="s2">walking through that like where I&#39;m hit</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.510" end="01:08:24.140" style="s2">by yeah I electic dialo goes the theory</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.250" end="01:08:29.750" style="s2">the theoretical birthing the theros in</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.140" end="01:08:31.310" style="s2">this moment in my listening it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.750" end="01:08:32.569" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s circles like that Plato</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.310" end="01:08:35.170" style="s2">talks about that the dialogues the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.569" end="01:08:38.170" style="s2">dialogues often do that circle - right</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.170" end="01:08:40.489" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.170" end="01:08:43.670" style="s2">communication is grounded in communing</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.489" end="01:08:48.560" style="s2">because the community gets us to trust</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.670" end="01:08:50.660" style="s2">in right in the open-ended feet I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.560" end="01:08:53.179" style="s2">our lives make us suspicious of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.660" end="01:08:54.620" style="s2">conversations in ways that are permeated</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.179" end="01:08:57.080" style="s2">into levels of our psyche that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.620" end="01:08:58.759" style="s2">even aware of but when we when we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.080" end="01:09:01.489" style="s2">when we can genuinely commune with</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.759" end="01:09:04.699" style="s2">somebody right that communing like I</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.489" end="01:09:07.160" style="s2">said it trains us in trust so that a</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.699" end="01:09:09.319" style="s2">kind of communication is possible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.160" end="01:09:11.960" style="s2">not otherwise possible as I&#39;m started</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.319" end="01:09:13.880" style="s2">struggling to articulate but the two</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.960" end="01:09:15.620" style="s2">words they keep singing to each other in</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.880" end="01:09:17.420" style="s2">my mind right now is this relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.620" end="01:09:19.489" style="s2">between communication and communing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.420" end="01:09:21.710" style="s2">there&#39;s something going on there right</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.489" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">and you know my ability to commune with</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.710" end="01:09:27.739" style="s2">somebody very deeply because of her</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:29.750" style="s2">depth and her maturity and her</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.739" end="01:09:31.609" style="s2">fundamental goodness all right</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.750" end="01:09:34.100" style="s2">has written has restored a kind of trust</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.609" end="01:09:41.779" style="s2">in me that then permeates my ability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.100" end="01:09:43.219" style="s2">communicate with others we learn more by</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.779" end="01:09:46.810" style="s2">modeling than we do just by talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.219" end="01:09:51.140" style="s2">right we really do we really really do</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.810" end="01:09:53.719" style="s2">yeah it is it fair to say that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.300" end="01:10:38.630" style="s2">level of the diet food</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.640" end="01:10:40.490" style="s2">the yellow goes right because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.630" end="01:10:42.380" style="s2">picking up on the one way in which the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.490" end="01:10:44.270" style="s2">logos differs from the logic because the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.380" end="01:10:45.880" style="s2">logos is the gathering of things that so</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.270" end="01:10:48.770" style="s2">such that they come to belong together</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.880" end="01:10:50.660" style="s2">right and so what you have is all these</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.770" end="01:10:52.640" style="s2">things that have not yet balked and have</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.660" end="01:10:54.110" style="s2">not yet belonged together and think</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.640" end="01:10:56.720" style="s2">about all the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.110" end="01:10:59.150" style="s2">going on there but you now gather them</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.720" end="01:11:01.040" style="s2">up they&#39;ve been gathered up so now they</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.150" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">now belong together and that belonging</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.040" end="01:11:06.050" style="s2">together is the communing that makes the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:08.120" style="s2">communication deeper did you see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.050" end="01:11:11.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to articulate yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.120" end="01:11:12.350" style="s2">and that and in what you&#39;re also talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.150" end="01:11:16.210" style="s2">about I just want to highlight this</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.350" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">because me like on my side of the street</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.210" end="01:11:20.570" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality of like I have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:22.670" style="s2">trying to do that for the longest time</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.570" end="01:11:25.760" style="s2">wit know what you&#39;re what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.670" end="01:11:28.520" style="s2">witnessing right now in with me with you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.760" end="01:11:30.140" style="s2">with these other conversations John I at</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.520" end="01:11:31.580" style="s2">this level I just haven&#39;t really had</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.140" end="01:11:34.490" style="s2">that many people to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.580" end="01:11:37.700" style="s2">right that&#39;s talking to Jordan about</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.490" end="01:11:39.890" style="s2">this yeah so there&#39;s this quality on one</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.700" end="01:11:45.380" style="s2">level like yeah I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.890" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">doing courses in in this this work and a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.380" end="01:11:49.700" style="s2">lot of like the coursework has just</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:53.510" style="s2">really been a function of my madness for</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.700" end="01:11:58.670" style="s2">it right but there&#39;s a way in which most</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.510" end="01:12:01.310" style="s2">of my philosophical inquiry with</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.670" end="01:12:04.400" style="s2">Heidegger and the existentialists and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.310" end="01:12:07.400" style="s2">everyone else has been really something</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.400" end="01:12:10.250" style="s2">that I that has been going on for me for</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.400" end="01:12:13.070" style="s2">the most part by myself that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.250" end="01:12:16.540" style="s2">bringing to the conversation but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.070" end="01:12:18.860" style="s2">not a lot of people that are necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.540" end="01:12:20.600" style="s2">predisposed to being interested in this</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.860" end="01:12:24.170" style="s2">level that we&#39;re talking about right</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.600" end="01:12:26.090" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.170" end="01:12:30.110" style="s2">way in which that that you&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.090" end="01:12:32.660" style="s2">to light this horizon where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.110" end="01:12:36.780" style="s2">just about as he said the other day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.660" end="01:12:42.100" style="s2">not just about agape</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.780" end="01:12:46.090" style="s2">logos right yeah it&#39;s like the agape in</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.100" end="01:12:49.270" style="s2">some and some level requires the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.090" end="01:12:52.780" style="s2">previous moving of the logos before it</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.270" end="01:12:55.600" style="s2">for it to be able to see that to become</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.780" end="01:13:00.449" style="s2">seers of it right there Wow to give</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.600" end="01:13:04.030" style="s2">birth to it and that mutual autopoietic</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.449" end="01:13:07.090" style="s2">self-transcending yet integrating what</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.030" end="01:13:09.460" style="s2">we transcended that that that that</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.090" end="01:13:11.410" style="s2">quality on some level what I think that</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.460" end="01:13:16.150" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about right now it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.410" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">important because it&#39;s not just personal</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.150" end="01:13:25.210" style="s2">intimacy its intimacy and that exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:27.429" style="s2">that can reveal what&#39;s worth being</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.210" end="01:13:29.230" style="s2">intimate about right I I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.429" end="01:13:32.980" style="s2">well said oh I had a student he was a</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.230" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">very good student and he said I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.980" end="01:13:37.900" style="s2">your stuff of Bimini crisis is really an</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:39.310" style="s2">intimacy crisis it&#39;s that people have</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.900" end="01:13:41.380" style="s2">lost a sense of being able to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.310" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">intimate with reality and intimate with</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.380" end="01:13:45.670" style="s2">what&#39;s good and what&#39;s true and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:47.469" style="s2">beautiful and then whether you were</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.670" end="01:13:48.910" style="s2">saying that I was thinking of this and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.469" end="01:13:50.620" style="s2">was hearing for some reason Paul&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.910" end="01:13:53.739" style="s2">saying it rather than my own voice in my</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.620" end="01:13:54.790" style="s2">head so that&#39;s good I was hearing him</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.739" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">saying you know the beginning you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.790" end="01:13:58.449" style="s2">in arcade logos in the beginning with</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:13:59.679" style="s2">the word is right there in the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.449" end="01:14:01.690" style="s2">is the logos you were trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.679" end="01:14:05.170" style="s2">articulate that right that the way the</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.690" end="01:14:07.000" style="s2">logos is this sort of you know the this</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.170" end="01:14:09.239" style="s2">arcade is foundational principle that</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.000" end="01:14:11.949" style="s2">makes it all possible</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.239" end="01:14:13.660" style="s2">yeah I think I I think both of those</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.949" end="01:14:16.360" style="s2">things I don&#39;t know how they sit</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.660" end="01:14:19.449" style="s2">together and then the third thing it was</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.360" end="01:14:21.489" style="s2">a big thing which was Jordan Hall and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.449" end="01:14:24.190" style="s2">were talking about just this and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.489" end="01:14:26.110" style="s2">they all relate to each other and Oh</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.190" end="01:14:29.380" style="s2">quick get the pattern here but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.110" end="01:14:31.929" style="s2">there right is this having you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.380" end="01:14:33.190" style="s2">peers and I&#39;m trying to do a tomb and</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.929" end="01:14:36.610" style="s2">I&#39;ll try to pick up also that it also</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.190" end="01:14:42.310" style="s2">means looking deeply to have peers that</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.610" end="01:14:43.000" style="s2">we that to talk to it is very very</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.310" end="01:14:45.880" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.000" end="01:14:48.730" style="s2">and you know getting people to</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.880" end="01:14:50.530" style="s2">experience community in peerage I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.730" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">is a really</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.530" end="01:14:55.210" style="s2">a fundamental thing and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:57.640" style="s2">again that&#39;s and that&#39;s how it&#39;s I see</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.210" end="01:14:59.200" style="s2">you know again the disability to draw</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.640" end="01:15:01.690" style="s2">things together so that they belong</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.200" end="01:15:03.490" style="s2">together that&#39;s in the beginning right</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.690" end="01:15:05.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the ground</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.490" end="01:15:09.760" style="s2">probity intelligibility is constantly</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.820" end="01:15:11.770" style="s2">emerging and I think that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.760" end="01:15:13.900" style="s2">phenomenologically mysterious to us I</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.770" end="01:15:16.030" style="s2">mean I think we can theoretically talk</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.900" end="01:15:18.430" style="s2">about it but you can&#39;t jump outside your</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.030" end="01:15:19.990" style="s2">framing you could ever get outside it</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.430" end="01:15:23.350" style="s2">right there&#39;s always something you</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.990" end="01:15:25.000" style="s2">you&#39;re always always amesh in it you can</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.350" end="01:15:27.490" style="s2">move from frame to frame where we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.000" end="01:15:31.210" style="s2">prisoners in that sense but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.490" end="01:15:33.880" style="s2">you can&#39;t write anything that&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.210" end="01:15:36.880" style="s2">the frame is not it&#39;s not itself the</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.880" end="01:15:39.430" style="s2">logos right it&#39;s only what the logos has</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.880" end="01:15:41.020" style="s2">articulated into the frame that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.430" end="01:15:42.700" style="s2">mean when I try to talk about you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.020" end="01:15:44.860" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s main insight it but things</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.700" end="01:15:47.710" style="s2">are constantly shining in yeah as</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.860" end="01:15:51.730" style="s2">articulation but we also get a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.710" end="01:15:53.860" style="s2">the deep recesses right into them you</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.730" end="01:15:56.260" style="s2">know the depths of the logos yes the</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.860" end="01:16:00.580" style="s2">depths of the inexhaustible Wow</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.260" end="01:16:04.750" style="s2">so I I just keep um couple well a couple</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.580" end="01:16:08.530" style="s2">things uh so I need to I need to go on</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.750" end="01:16:11.670" style="s2">to my next I feel sorry for my client</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.530" end="01:16:15.430" style="s2">cuz they&#39;re just gonna get like a boat</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.670" end="01:16:18.760" style="s2">what I&#39;m present to is you know perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.430" end="01:16:20.140" style="s2">this is pop this probably plays on some</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.760" end="01:16:22.330" style="s2">of the relationships that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.140" end="01:16:24.460" style="s2">about that are singing to each other so</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.330" end="01:16:26.770" style="s2">unlock on one level there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.460" end="01:16:28.360" style="s2">experience of like yeah now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.770" end="01:16:30.310" style="s2">trying to art what I heard you say is</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.360" end="01:16:32.290" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to articulate what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.310" end="01:16:35.290" style="s2">into a like just coming into being</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.290" end="01:16:39.070" style="s2">there&#39;s something I can feel but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.290" end="01:16:42.310" style="s2">quite it&#39;s come together for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.070" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">coming together as it&#39;s it&#39;s singing of</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.310" end="01:16:46.570" style="s2">my nervous system like my nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:48.910" style="s2">feels like it&#39;s like humming and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.570" end="01:16:51.070" style="s2">right now and like how much so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.910" end="01:16:52.870" style="s2">like it&#39;s so full of meaning that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.070" end="01:17:00.120" style="s2">like it&#39;s pushing water out of my eyes</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.870" end="01:17:03.940" style="s2">you know and there is this quality of of</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.120" end="01:17:04.390" style="s2">this mysterious this mystery that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.940" end="01:17:08.680" style="s2">there for</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.390" end="01:17:10.960" style="s2">which is how do I know to be struck by</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.680" end="01:17:13.620" style="s2">something mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.960" end="01:17:16.810" style="s2">before I understand what I&#39;m struck by</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.620" end="01:17:18.790" style="s2">you know in that sense I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.810" end="01:17:22.210" style="s2">like I&#39;m understanding that at a level</p>

<p begin="01:18:03.130" end="01:18:07.690" style="s2">right that again that I&#39;ve explained it</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.560" end="01:18:09.970" style="s2">away the whole time you you were saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.690" end="01:18:12.250" style="s2">what you were saying I was there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="01:18:12.250" end="01:18:16.270" style="s2">it&#39;s near the end and I start that the</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.260" end="01:18:18.280" style="s2">therapist is saying you know yes but</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.270" end="01:18:20.710" style="s2">explain me and he&#39;s talking about Equus</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.280" end="01:18:23.380" style="s2">how is it that all of these things come</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.710" end="01:18:25.780" style="s2">together and become something sacred how</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.380" end="01:18:27.910" style="s2">does how did they come together right</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.780" end="01:18:29.950" style="s2">and he he has a sense of this because</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.910" end="01:18:32.170" style="s2">he&#39;s bearing witness to this epiphany</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.950" end="01:18:34.690" style="s2">and he&#39;s and he&#39;s able to you know he</p>

<p begin="01:18:34.690" end="01:18:43.300" style="s2">the same right and it&#39;s that you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.780" end="01:18:47.410" style="s2">you know is that it&#39;s down these things</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.300" end="01:18:50.080" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t you can&#39;t make a</p>

<p begin="01:18:50.080" end="01:18:53.950" style="s2">house you have to you but you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.820" end="01:18:56.380" style="s2">neither can you just receive a symbol if</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.950" end="01:18:58.030" style="s2">I just give it to you it&#39;s not it hat it</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.380" end="01:19:00.220" style="s2">has to translate</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.030" end="01:19:01.930" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of I think what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.220" end="01:19:03.760" style="s2">deprived of you hear there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.930" end="01:19:06.550" style="s2">again in which the articulation is an</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.760" end="01:19:09.700" style="s2">attempt right not to just so part of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.550" end="01:19:11.410" style="s2">is it is the theory into theoria but</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.700" end="01:19:13.540" style="s2">part of it is as I say it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.410" end="01:19:15.730" style="s2">the respect that is to respect what</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.540" end="01:19:17.860" style="s2">symbols are trying to be for the police</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.730" end="01:19:19.659" style="s2">desk</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.860" end="01:19:21.070" style="s2">and again like it&#39;s so that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.659" end="01:19:23.050" style="s2">the Neoplatonism for me is such a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.070" end="01:19:25.150" style="s2">powerful template because you can see</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.050" end="01:19:27.369" style="s2">right Plato is just he just moves</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.150" end="01:19:29.650" style="s2">seamlessly between the poetry and the</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.369" end="01:19:32.409" style="s2">theory and the theory those three are</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.650" end="01:19:33.489" style="s2">just seamlessly talking to each other at</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.409" end="01:19:36.489" style="s2">all times</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.489" end="01:19:38.320" style="s2">Wow and that&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.489" end="01:19:40.960" style="s2">template you need to go back and recover</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.320" end="01:19:42.909" style="s2">not like you know the purported platonic</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.960" end="01:19:46.000" style="s2">metaphysics or the arguments but this</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.909" end="01:19:49.090" style="s2">this ability to get the theory the furia</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.000" end="01:19:52.230" style="s2">and the police&#39;s mutually consonant with</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.090" end="01:19:54.369" style="s2">each other the perfect place to complete</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.230" end="01:19:56.800" style="s2">yes very much</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.369" end="01:19:58.600" style="s2">so good to talk to you my good friend so</p>
