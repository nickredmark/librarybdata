<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">I will as soon as I find out but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">suspect that things will go on as normal</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:53.570" style="s2">so just do what we&#39;ve been doing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:53.570" style="s2">the theory yeah I don&#39;t think she is</p>

<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">if they don&#39;t I will figure out what to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">do about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:41.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna be left hanging with</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">this course okay so just do the door do</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.850" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">the work we&#39;ll figure out how you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">your damn credit I&#39;m gonna do everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">I can so that you&#39;re not left hanging</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:54.560" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">you know the beef isn&#39;t with you guys so</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.560" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">so don&#39;t worry about it for now just</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:02.369" style="s2">proceed as if everything will be worked</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">out okay okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.369" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">so I want to show you some images and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:08.190" style="s2">these are great far their images</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:09.509" style="s2">fundamentally and I want you to take a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.190" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">look at them because they&#39;re powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.509" end="00:02:13.709" style="s2">propaganda images and we want to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">what they represent so on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.709" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">right you see Hitler there who&#39;s taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:25.469" style="s2">over from Hindenburg I believe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">right I can&#39;t remember he was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.469" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">president before Hitler came came aboard</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:33.480" style="s2">and so you see that there&#39;s the transfer</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:35.819" style="s2">of power from the wise old man to the to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.480" end="00:02:39.109" style="s2">the emergent hero that&#39;s the image on</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.819" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">the left right and so then on the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.109" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">well so what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:52.799" style="s2">picture what does it represent what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:56.299" style="s2">going on there what&#39;s that yeah we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.799" end="00:02:56.299" style="s2">just look at just look at the image</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.620" end="00:03:12.780" style="s2">security it&#39;s the balance between Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:15.180" style="s2">and Horus right it&#39;s different than that</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.780" end="00:03:17.940" style="s2">that&#39;s close but you know it&#39;s a call to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.180" end="00:03:22.430" style="s2">heroism from the youth with the father</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:25.639" style="s2">who&#39;s far-seeing and you know composed</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.430" end="00:03:30.900" style="s2">serving as the protector and the model</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.639" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">so ya know that&#39;s your sort of ideal</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.900" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">Aryan youth yeah and it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:40.979" style="s2">picture eh because it&#39;s it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:42.359" style="s2">picture that represents a child in a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.979" end="00:03:44.669" style="s2">that you very seldom see children</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.359" end="00:03:47.310" style="s2">represented you know because the child</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.669" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">is very serious and determined and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.310" end="00:03:51.870" style="s2">know that&#39;s not an acceptable image of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:53.759" style="s2">child generally speaking in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.870" end="00:03:55.229" style="s2">that&#39;s optimistic and naive because the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.759" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">kids are always like they&#39;re little</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.229" end="00:04:02.609" style="s2">innocent things that have no power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">like that&#39;s wrong yes definitely oh</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.609" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">definitely he&#39;s a great father</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">he&#39;s the all-seeing great father in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">background he&#39;s like The Wizard of Oz</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.159" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">fundamentally you know so yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">he&#39;s partly ordered and that was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.280" end="00:04:17.449" style="s2">part of Hitler and that&#39;s partly was</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:20.909" style="s2">attractive because Germany was</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.449" end="00:04:23.159" style="s2">absolutely in chaos so that made order</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.909" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">more and more attractive right so and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.159" end="00:04:27.680" style="s2">Hitler was a very orderly person so</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.610" end="00:04:37.289" style="s2">and so what does that mean why would</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:39.930" style="s2">that be the case that&#39;s right right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.289" end="00:04:42.330" style="s2">that means they&#39;re above you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.930" end="00:04:43.949" style="s2">looking up at an ideal right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.330" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">because they&#39;re up in the dominance</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.949" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">hierarchy you&#39;re kneeling that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:52.039" style="s2">way of thinking about it yes yes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:52.039" style="s2">also lit from above</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.629" end="00:04:59.009" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s far-seeing right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.699" end="00:05:02.069" style="s2">looking far ahead into the future that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.009" end="00:05:04.050" style="s2">right that&#39;s good all right so then</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.069" end="00:05:08.159" style="s2">there&#39;s the picture on the left so what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.050" end="00:05:09.300" style="s2">do you think about that oh well maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.159" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">can make it a little bit bigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.300" end="00:05:14.490" style="s2">what you have is Hitler on the right of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">the picture in the left and then a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.490" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">number of people crowded around him and</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:22.979" style="s2">they&#39;re all smiling and and joyful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:25.529" style="s2">so that&#39;s a representation of Hitler as</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.979" end="00:05:28.439" style="s2">the jovial father of the race right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.529" end="00:05:31.800" style="s2">you see it said at a at a table and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.439" end="00:05:33.810" style="s2">do people do at a table that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.800" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">they share it right and so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.810" end="00:05:40.319" style="s2">familial that&#39;s a very familial</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:42.060" style="s2">enterprise and to share food with</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.319" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">someone is to bring them into your house</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.060" end="00:05:46.650" style="s2">right and to be the distributor of food</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:49.909" style="s2">is to be the benevolent father and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.650" end="00:05:53.250" style="s2">on the right you see Hitler addressing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.909" end="00:05:55.319" style="s2">large political crowd you know he&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.250" end="00:05:57.960" style="s2">on a high platform with his men behind</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.319" end="00:05:59.969" style="s2">him and then these these Eagles carrying</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.960" end="00:06:01.469" style="s2">the swastika sort of arrayed behind him</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.969" end="00:06:05.339" style="s2">so he&#39;s up again</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.469" end="00:06:10.199" style="s2">so very good at theatrics the Nazis were</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.339" end="00:06:12.300" style="s2">very good at using theatrics so then you</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.199" end="00:06:17.279" style="s2">see them on the left there what do you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.300" end="00:06:20.189" style="s2">think about that picture yet stoic and</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.279" end="00:06:21.629" style="s2">resolute right yeah exactly okay and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.189" end="00:06:24.839" style="s2">then you have the mental picture where</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.629" end="00:06:28.650" style="s2">the Germans are basically marching with</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.839" end="00:06:31.139" style="s2">what are really remade roman banners you</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.650" end="00:06:34.339" style="s2">know and so what do you what do you what</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.139" end="00:06:34.339" style="s2">does that image show</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.270" end="00:06:40.409" style="s2">yes it&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right it shows</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.909" end="00:06:42.509" style="s2">uniformity and solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.409" end="00:06:45.029" style="s2">and the uniformity comes out because</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.509" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">everyone&#39;s the same right and that makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.029" end="00:06:51.059" style="s2">them a powerful united force now you</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:53.459" style="s2">might ask yourself well why would people</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.059" end="00:06:59.339" style="s2">want that and so what&#39;s the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.459" end="00:07:03.389" style="s2">that and power I mean you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.339" end="00:07:05.219" style="s2">part of a like a powerful United force</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.389" end="00:07:07.349" style="s2">or do you want to be like the weak</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.219" end="00:07:11.279" style="s2">member of an if completely fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.349" end="00:07:14.009" style="s2">society you know so now you might say</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.279" end="00:07:16.289" style="s2">well I don&#39;t want to be too integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.009" end="00:07:18.209" style="s2">but you know one thing I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.289" end="00:07:20.009" style="s2">don&#39;t overestimate the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.209" end="00:07:21.179" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be too integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.009" end="00:07:23.069" style="s2">because you know modern people</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.179" end="00:07:24.869" style="s2">especially in the West they like to</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.069" end="00:07:27.679" style="s2">think of themselves as individuals it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.869" end="00:07:30.719" style="s2">like I have a hypothesis about that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.679" end="00:07:32.999" style="s2">think people in the West are actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.719" end="00:07:36.300" style="s2">the most conforming people in the entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.999" end="00:07:38.669" style="s2">world and that&#39;s why they can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.300" end="00:07:42.179" style="s2">dance around on top of that like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.669" end="00:07:45.619" style="s2">free and the reason is everyone stops at</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.179" end="00:07:48.629" style="s2">the red lights you know everyone obeys</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.619" end="00:07:50.339" style="s2">everything virtually and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.629" end="00:07:52.050" style="s2">dress weirdly and maybe you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.339" end="00:07:54.029" style="s2">bizarre opinion and you can go off and</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.050" end="00:07:57.209" style="s2">do something that&#39;s a little out of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.029" end="00:07:59.819" style="s2">ordinary in some corner but 99% of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.209" end="00:08:02.669" style="s2">time you&#39;re conformist right to the damn</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.819" end="00:08:04.919" style="s2">bone and that&#39;s a good thing because if</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.669" end="00:08:07.289" style="s2">you weren&#39;t the society wouldn&#39;t be so</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.919" end="00:08:10.679" style="s2">stable and so predictable across you</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.289" end="00:08:12.839" style="s2">know reasonable spans of time so but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.679" end="00:08:13.879" style="s2">idea that the West is individualistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.839" end="00:08:16.739" style="s2">it&#39;s like we might represent</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.879" end="00:08:18.929" style="s2">individualism as a form of deity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.739" end="00:08:20.550" style="s2">aspire to it and we might even worship</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.929" end="00:08:23.369" style="s2">it when it occurs because we do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.550" end="00:08:25.379" style="s2">celebrities and so forth but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.369" end="00:08:26.969" style="s2">it&#39;s bowed by no means reasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.379" end="00:08:30.389" style="s2">assume that the West is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.969" end="00:08:34.529" style="s2">individualistic you know I mean I grew</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.389" end="00:08:36.539" style="s2">up in western canada and in edmonton if</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.529" end="00:08:39.389" style="s2">there&#39;s a light that&#39;s red like if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.539" end="00:08:41.759" style="s2">know you&#39;re supposed to not walk people</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.389" end="00:08:44.850" style="s2">will stand there on the street when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.759" end="00:08:46.620" style="s2">40 below and wait until the light</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.850" end="00:08:48.689" style="s2">changes even if they can&#39;t see a car</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.620" end="00:08:50.009" style="s2">anywhere near in any direction like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.689" end="00:08:51.779" style="s2">was quite shocking to me when I first</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.009" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">moved to Montreal and people were</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.779" end="00:08:54.180" style="s2">jaywalking you know I thought God</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:55.800" style="s2">Himself was</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.180" end="00:08:57.899" style="s2">to strike me down with lightning if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.800" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">did it you know now that the roads are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.899" end="00:09:03.300" style="s2">narrow and so that&#39;s part of it but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:04.950" style="s2">Montreal is definitely a lot pushier or</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.300" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">as pedestrians than people in the West</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.950" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">and the other thing that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:09.779" style="s2">interesting about the West traffic</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">patterns is that if you&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.779" end="00:09:14.550" style="s2">the road looking like you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.690" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">cross even if it&#39;s jaywalking Villa will</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.550" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">stop and let you cross it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:19.380" style="s2">annoying because you&#39;re just standing</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:21.600" style="s2">there it&#39;s like you know five people</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.380" end="00:09:23.670" style="s2">stop and then you have to walk across</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.600" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">the street just not to disappoint them</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.670" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">so you know the thing about conformity</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:32.040" style="s2">is it is it it makes her a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:34.520" style="s2">amount of stability and believe me we</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.040" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be promoting nonconformity if</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.520" end="00:09:39.209" style="s2">everyone was non-conforming we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.740" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">thinking hey it&#39;s time to get this whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.209" end="00:09:43.080" style="s2">thing conforming quite quite tightly one</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:47.370" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.080" end="00:09:49.260" style="s2">Islam lately is that you know when when</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.370" end="00:09:52.380" style="s2">you when you want to define a religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.260" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">we determine it&#39;s a religion a religion</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.380" end="00:09:57.300" style="s2">of peace or of war and you think well it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:59.220" style="s2">might depend on the level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.300" end="00:10:02.400" style="s2">you know one of the things that Islam</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.220" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">did was take a society that was very</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.400" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">tribal and fractious and United across a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:11.550" style="s2">large portion of territory so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:13.410" style="s2">what it did that by expanding its</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.550" end="00:10:16.380" style="s2">domains and incorporating other people</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.410" end="00:10:18.779" style="s2">and also going to war so on the fringes</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.380" end="00:10:21.150" style="s2">of the Islamic expansion there was all</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.779" end="00:10:23.100" style="s2">sorts of bloodshed and misery but then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.150" end="00:10:24.930" style="s2">inside it there was this hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.100" end="00:10:27.089" style="s2">organization of people that were</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:29.459" style="s2">basically only organized into little</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.089" end="00:10:32.220" style="s2">bitty tribal groups before that so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.459" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">might say well that within the expanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.220" end="00:10:37.350" style="s2">bubble of influence it was peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.910" style="s2">then on the fringes it was violent and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.350" end="00:10:41.130" style="s2">then you might say well what does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.910" end="00:10:43.230" style="s2">mean over the long run is that warlike</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.130" end="00:10:45.540" style="s2">or peaceful and I don&#39;t really know how</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.230" end="00:10:47.190" style="s2">to answer that question you know because</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.540" end="00:10:49.500" style="s2">it depends on which angle you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.190" end="00:10:52.980" style="s2">at it from you know we certainly know</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.500" end="00:10:55.560" style="s2">that as humanity aggregated itself into</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.980" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">larger and larger collectives there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.560" end="00:11:00.089" style="s2">a lot of conflict that had to be had in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:02.130" style="s2">order for that to occur but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.089" end="00:11:04.260" style="s2">consequence like you think about our our</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.130" end="00:11:07.170" style="s2">lives at the moment the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.260" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">one of you will get killed by a homicide</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.170" end="00:11:10.500" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:11.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s vanishingly low and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.500" end="00:11:15.960" style="s2">you might ask yourself well how much</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.880" end="00:11:17.430" style="s2">bloodshed and conflict did that take you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.960" end="00:11:19.890" style="s2">know before everyone was hammered</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.430" end="00:11:23.160" style="s2">together so damn tightly that well</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.890" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">here&#39;s another way of looking at it why</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.160" end="00:11:29.070" style="s2">is it possible for women to have rights</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">in the West and I think the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.070" end="00:11:33.870" style="s2">that is because they can go outside</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:36.320" style="s2">without being raped so you know it the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.870" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">whole culture is so damn peaceful now</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.320" end="00:11:45.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s a woman can present herself</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">alone to strange men and not die as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.270" end="00:11:49.350" style="s2">consequence of it it&#39;s like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:54.420" style="s2">then you can start talking about rights</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.350" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">it&#39;s before that it&#39;s whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.420" end="00:11:59.340" style="s2">talking about it&#39;s not right mostly what</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:01.650" style="s2">it is is protection you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.340" end="00:12:03.060" style="s2">be protected and there&#39;s lots of places</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.650" end="00:12:05.520" style="s2">in the world where that&#39;s still exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.060" end="00:12:07.260" style="s2">the way it is you know I know that even</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.520" end="00:12:09.810" style="s2">when I was traveling through Europe</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.260" end="00:12:12.210" style="s2">years ago when the 80s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.810" end="00:12:15.090" style="s2">traveled with a friend of mine a woman</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.210" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">and her boyfriend and when we went</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.090" end="00:12:20.130" style="s2">through Italy for example she was blond</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.180" end="00:12:22.500" style="s2">she was just harassed to death by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.130" end="00:12:25.800" style="s2">Italian men I mean not in any Norton</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.500" end="00:12:27.210" style="s2">anyway that was brutal I&#39;m sure it does</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.800" end="00:12:29.400" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it does</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.210" end="00:12:32.670" style="s2">so we took her over to Greece as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.400" end="00:12:35.660" style="s2">and we went to this place called Patras</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.670" end="00:12:37.680" style="s2">and Patras had this absolutely weird</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.660" end="00:12:39.090" style="s2">celebration that was like the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.680" end="00:12:40.980" style="s2">biggest celebration in the world I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.090" end="00:12:43.770" style="s2">never even heard of it and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.980" end="00:12:45.930" style="s2">things they do there is everybody goes</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.770" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">on the street with these plastic bats</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.930" end="00:12:49.350" style="s2">you know they&#39;re really light plastic</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:50.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of kid would use and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.350" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">they were like this big round their</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.460" end="00:12:54.330" style="s2">plastic was firm enough so that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:57.390" style="s2">bat but soft enough so if you got</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.330" end="00:12:59.220" style="s2">whacked with it in a semi playful way it</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.390" end="00:13:00.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna hurt and then everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.220" end="00:13:02.790" style="s2">also sprayed each other with silly</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.840" end="00:13:05.490" style="s2">string which I thought was an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.790" end="00:13:06.720" style="s2">bizarre nut stuff wasn&#39;t that also like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.490" end="00:13:08.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a million people out in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.720" end="00:13:10.080" style="s2">street and everybody&#39;s hitting each</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.520" end="00:13:12.870" style="s2">other with bats and spraying each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.080" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">with silly string and this poor girl she</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.870" end="00:13:19.230" style="s2">must been hit like ten thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.780" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">you know so and it wasn&#39;t malevolent it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.230" end="00:13:21.630" style="s2">was playful you know it had to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:23.010" style="s2">because if whenever</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.630" end="00:13:25.230" style="s2">one&#39;s hitting everybody else with bats</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.010" end="00:13:28.130" style="s2">it bloody well better stay playful right</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.230" end="00:13:30.870" style="s2">but the pro thing is is that she</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.130" end="00:13:32.520" style="s2">couldn&#39;t move with anywhere near the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.870" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">same freedom that I could move and</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.520" end="00:13:40.410" style="s2">that&#39;s only a tiny tiny echo of what it</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:42.270" style="s2">would have been like in many places five</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.410" end="00:13:45.480" style="s2">hundred years ago or a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.270" end="00:13:47.190" style="s2">ago so again you know there&#39;s this basis</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.480" end="00:13:49.230" style="s2">of absolute conformity that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.190" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">prerequisite to as freedom especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.230" end="00:13:55.890" style="s2">freedom for people who are vulnerable in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:57.870" style="s2">many ways so that&#39;s part of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.890" end="00:14:00.300" style="s2">celebrated in that image and you know if</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.870" end="00:14:01.830" style="s2">people are in the state of chaos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.300" end="00:14:04.740" style="s2">one thing that really attracts them</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.830" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">they&#39;re attracted by order and so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.740" end="00:14:08.130" style="s2">know you always have to give the devil</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:11.160" style="s2">his due if you&#39;re trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.130" end="00:14:13.410" style="s2">something like Nazism you have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.160" end="00:14:17.610" style="s2">understand why it might be attractive to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.410" end="00:14:20.250" style="s2">someone like you now the question is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.610" end="00:14:22.950" style="s2">part why did it go so pathologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.250" end="00:14:24.660" style="s2">wrong well that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.950" end="00:14:26.700" style="s2">going to untangle you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.660" end="00:14:29.820" style="s2">might say well you might have benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.700" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">motives in establishing order but order</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.820" end="00:14:35.670" style="s2">shades into tyranny and then your your</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">your motivations for establishing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.670" end="00:14:40.590" style="s2">tyranny might be completely self-serving</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:42.570" style="s2">and cruel you know there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.590" end="00:14:44.580" style="s2">process that gets you too self-serving</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.570" end="00:14:46.800" style="s2">and cruel certainly is what happened</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.580" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">with the Nazis the question is was that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.800" end="00:14:50.370" style="s2">there all along was it something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">emerged was it like the snake in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.370" end="00:14:55.950" style="s2">garden that was gonna present itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:58.680" style="s2">well and you have Hitler on on the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.950" end="00:15:00.780" style="s2">there and that&#39;s a Nazi art statue</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.680" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">behind it and you know it&#39;s kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.780" end="00:15:06.810" style="s2">this quasi Greek element although and</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.790" style="s2">and Hitler was an admirer of classical</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.810" end="00:15:10.770" style="s2">statuary but then everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.790" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2">exaggerated about it there&#39;s this sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.770" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">of hyper-masculine well it&#39;s like hyper</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">masculine eyes Greek sculpture that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">the part of the Nazi aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.670" end="00:15:30.899" style="s2">so that one on the Left says one folk</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.529" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">one country one leaders that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.899" end="00:15:35.970" style="s2">furor means you know and so there you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:37.889" style="s2">see that Hitler&#39;s head is assimilated to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.970" end="00:15:39.899" style="s2">the idea of a country right so it says</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.889" end="00:15:44.190" style="s2">this is there&#39;s something about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.899" end="00:15:46.019" style="s2">country that&#39;s Hitler&#39;s head so like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.190" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">might think do you ever use symbols like</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.019" end="00:15:51.449" style="s2">that and the answer is well as sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">every time you give someone a coin right</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.449" end="00:15:56.550" style="s2">so Hitler&#39;s head is like the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.769" style="s2">realm and so what does that mean in some</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.550" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">sense it means that the realm is an</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.769" end="00:16:03.209" style="s2">embodiment of Hitler or it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.100" style="s2">embodiment of the leader and actually a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.209" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">realm is the embodiment of the leader</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.100" end="00:16:09.660" style="s2">because it&#39;s a body of laws and so what</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:11.820" style="s2">it represents is a mode of being and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.660" end="00:16:14.010" style="s2">that&#39;s what that expresses and then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.820" end="00:16:15.870" style="s2">have him on the left there and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.010" end="00:16:18.180" style="s2">you can kind of see what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.870" end="00:16:20.760" style="s2">emotions he thought were morally</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.180" end="00:16:22.740" style="s2">appropriate and so it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.760" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">caricature except there&#39;s a but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.740" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">an element of seriousness about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:29.550" style="s2">that&#39;s that that stops it from being a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:31.230" style="s2">caricature and so what do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.550" end="00:16:39.560" style="s2">say about that picture on the right what</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:39.560" style="s2">does that say to you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:48.059" style="s2">yeah so those are all positive things so</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.929" end="00:16:51.079" style="s2">far or they could be argued to be that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.059" end="00:16:53.639" style="s2">do you see anything that isn&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.079" end="00:16:56.699" style="s2">there&#39;s some disdain yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.639" end="00:16:58.499" style="s2">who said that yeah it says I agree</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.699" end="00:17:00.209" style="s2">there&#39;s some disdain it&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.499" end="00:17:01.800" style="s2">narrowed eyebrows it&#39;s partly the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.209" end="00:17:04.289" style="s2">that his face is up a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.800" end="00:17:07.020" style="s2">disdain is associated with contempt and</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.289" end="00:17:09.029" style="s2">disgust yeah and so I would also say</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.020" end="00:17:11.010" style="s2">there&#39;s some arrogance in that partly</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.029" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">it&#39;s the sideways pose you know because</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.010" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">it&#39;s a real pose and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:36.659" style="s2">well I think one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.250" end="00:17:40.639" style="s2">think you can see in the picture is</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.659" end="00:17:43.529" style="s2">overcompensation you know because to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.639" end="00:17:46.919" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t be any more dominant that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.529" end="00:17:48.570" style="s2">is necessary but you really have to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.919" end="00:17:50.879" style="s2">well put together not to be more</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.570" end="00:17:53.250" style="s2">dominant that&#39;s necessary and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.879" end="00:17:56.669" style="s2">the dominance is a compensation at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.250" end="00:17:58.169" style="s2">in part for childhood inadequacy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.669" end="00:18:02.070" style="s2">weakness that was actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.169" end="00:18:04.230" style="s2">central axioms of a blur Adlerian theory</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.070" end="00:18:06.120" style="s2">you know that what people were doing as</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.230" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">they progress towards adulthood was</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.120" end="00:18:10.950" style="s2">compensating for the inferiority of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:13.019" style="s2">their childhood you know and he said</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.950" end="00:18:15.870" style="s2">they&#39;d often overcompensate and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.019" end="00:18:17.639" style="s2">if you watch your own behavior you you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.870" end="00:18:18.690" style="s2">could see that happening all the time it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.639" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">happens all the time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.690" end="00:18:22.830" style="s2">extraordinarily difficult not to push</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:24.419" style="s2">any harder than you have to and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.830" end="00:18:26.340" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s because you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.419" end="00:18:28.500" style="s2">look better than you are tougher than</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.340" end="00:18:31.019" style="s2">you are and I think there is an element</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.500" end="00:18:33.090" style="s2">that you can see in that because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.019" end="00:18:35.190" style="s2">like it&#39;s a bit too much you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.090" end="00:18:36.509" style="s2">would also say one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.190" end="00:18:39.629" style="s2">noticed about people who&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.509" end="00:18:41.340" style="s2">mastered something is that they can do</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.629" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">it with a touch of humor even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.340" end="00:18:45.059" style="s2">really serious you know and I had this</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:47.750" style="s2">thought when I was teaching this</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.059" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">material probably 15 years ago I thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.750" end="00:18:51.210" style="s2">there was a little voice in my head that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.190" style="s2">said well you know you should lighten up</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.210" end="00:18:54.899" style="s2">a bit and I thought what do you mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.190" end="00:18:57.750" style="s2">talking about genocide it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.899" end="00:19:01.049" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna lighten up and then I thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.750" end="00:19:03.389" style="s2">I was thinking about Young&#39;s notion of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.049" end="00:19:05.669" style="s2">the of the gesture and the Joker as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.389" end="00:19:08.759" style="s2">precursor to the Savior there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.669" end="00:19:10.590" style="s2">element of subversion and humor that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.759" end="00:19:13.740" style="s2">goes along with attempting to crack a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.590" end="00:19:15.539" style="s2">difficult problem and I I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.740" end="00:19:18.029" style="s2">that for about five years and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.539" end="00:19:22.919" style="s2">no it&#39;s right if you if if there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.029" end="00:19:25.009" style="s2">if there isn&#39;t something that&#39;s akin to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.919" end="00:19:27.389" style="s2">the sort of thing that a comedian does</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.009" end="00:19:28.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about something then</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.389" end="00:19:30.389" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it too seriously</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.740" end="00:19:33.210" style="s2">it means you haven&#39;t mastered it you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.389" end="00:19:36.529" style="s2">can&#39;t do it with a light touch so and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.210" end="00:19:36.529" style="s2">think you can see that in him</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">well there&#39;s one on the left there</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.429" end="00:19:51.289" style="s2">that&#39;s Hitler for president so what do</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:51.620" style="s2">you what do you see in that yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.289" end="00:19:53.929" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.620" end="00:20:07.340" style="s2">how how how is there an indication of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.929" end="00:20:10.840" style="s2">clear direction yeah absolutely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.340" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it well it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very intense</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.840" end="00:20:15.559" style="s2">perspective so there&#39;s a force moving</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:16.700" style="s2">upward and he&#39;s at the top of the force</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.559" end="00:20:18.350" style="s2">of the lines go</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.700" end="00:20:20.450" style="s2">weirdly they go to the left which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.350" end="00:20:22.130" style="s2">quite interesting because generally the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.450" end="00:20:24.289" style="s2">way you would read a poster like that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.130" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">that harsh movement to the left is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.289" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">regressive right it&#39;s backwards but you</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.840" end="00:20:32.330" style="s2">know you can understand why that might</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:34.309" style="s2">be and he&#39;s clearly the thing that sits</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.330" end="00:20:36.260" style="s2">on top of the pillars remember I showed</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.309" end="00:20:38.030" style="s2">you a picture of Osiris he may not</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.260" end="00:20:40.460" style="s2">remember this that was Osiris his hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.030" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">on a pillar it&#39;s the same idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.460" end="00:20:44.270" style="s2">that his body is the body of the state</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:46.280" style="s2">and the state has this powerful movement</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.270" end="00:20:49.970" style="s2">forward then there this is an infamous</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.280" end="00:20:54.679" style="s2">picture this one in the middle so what</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.970" end="00:20:57.830" style="s2">do you think about that oh yeah he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.679" end="00:21:00.169" style="s2">knight he&#39;s a white knight in fact yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.830" end="00:21:02.780" style="s2">so he&#39;s assimilated to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.169" end="00:21:05.179" style="s2">medieval nobility you know and in its</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.780" end="00:21:09.169" style="s2">purest form he&#39;s a knight of the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.179" end="00:21:10.429" style="s2">you know and so there&#39;s a Wagner ian</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.169" end="00:21:12.590" style="s2">element to that and he was a great</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.429" end="00:21:14.030" style="s2">admirer of Wagner Wagner Ian music by</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.590" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">the way and Hitler wanted to put music</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.030" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">halls in every classical music halls in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:20.750" style="s2">every city in Europe it was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:23.240" style="s2">obsession of his he was obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.750" end="00:21:25.700" style="s2">Wagner and opera and he claimed that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.240" end="00:21:28.520" style="s2">had quasi religious experiences</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.700" end="00:21:31.580" style="s2">listening to it you know so he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.520" end="00:21:34.700" style="s2">strange character because Hitler was</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.580" end="00:21:36.830" style="s2">extremely appears to have been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.700" end="00:21:38.299" style="s2">high in openness which is not something</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.830" end="00:21:40.669" style="s2">you would expect for someone who is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.299" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">tyrant you know because conservative</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.669" end="00:21:44.659" style="s2">people are basically very low in</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:46.730" style="s2">openness and very high and orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.659" end="00:21:48.770" style="s2">but he appeared to be someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.730" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">very high and orderliness and very high</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.770" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2">and openness</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.500" end="00:21:54.130" style="s2">that made him charismatic you know so</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.480" end="00:21:56.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeply conservative element</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.130" end="00:21:58.840" style="s2">and an element that was obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.200" end="00:22:00.850" style="s2">will and antithetical to chaos but he</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.840" end="00:22:04.179" style="s2">was able to bring this tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.850" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">artistic force into his politicking and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.179" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">it it was captivating to people</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:18.100" style="s2">to what was compensatory yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.540" end="00:23:20.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable way</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.100" end="00:23:22.600" style="s2">of thinking about it but I also think he</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.050" end="00:23:24.400" style="s2">was opened by temperament and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.600" end="00:23:27.010" style="s2">the things that happens to open people</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.400" end="00:23:29.260" style="s2">is that if they listen to music that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.010" end="00:23:30.610" style="s2">really captures them you know the hair</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.260" end="00:23:33.610" style="s2">stands up on the back of their neck</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.610" end="00:23:36.400" style="s2">they&#39;re the the experience is sort of at</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.610" end="00:23:38.200" style="s2">hand you know and I also think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.400" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">easy for people to assume that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.200" end="00:23:41.230" style="s2">they&#39;re having that experience that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:44.410" style="s2">they&#39;re being inhabited by something</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.230" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s akin to divinity you know and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.410" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">know you don&#39;t you don&#39;t want to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:50.560" style="s2">light of that kind of experience because</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:52.570" style="s2">music is incredibly gripping almost</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.560" end="00:23:54.610" style="s2">everyone likes music you know some</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.570" end="00:23:56.170" style="s2">people like conventional music so you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.610" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">know they can tolerate a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.170" end="00:24:00.670" style="s2">exposure to the divine force of music</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.700" style="s2">not much that&#39;s usually conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.670" end="00:24:05.980" style="s2">because they listen to very conventional</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.700" end="00:24:08.470" style="s2">pop music and then there&#39;s this wide</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.980" end="00:24:11.730" style="s2">variation but almost across almost all</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.470" end="00:24:15.460" style="s2">people music produces this influx of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.730" end="00:24:17.800" style="s2">Dionysian force you know really hyper</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.460" end="00:24:22.450" style="s2">conservatives so bad music and dancing</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.800" end="00:24:24.130" style="s2">right so because it&#39;s subversive so and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.450" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">then you have the one on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.130" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">right so tell me about that one</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.479" end="00:24:56.669" style="s2">absolutely he&#39;s at the forefront of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.919" end="00:24:59.879" style="s2">heroic what would you call that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.669" end="00:25:01.859" style="s2">Roman formation yes exactly he&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.879" end="00:25:08.029" style="s2">very forefront of that you know and no</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.859" end="00:25:08.029" style="s2">sir yes no go ahead go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.979" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">absolutely you know so but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.999" end="00:25:15.809" style="s2">happening if you look at that image it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:18.570" style="s2">like that&#39;s Christ with the Holy Ghost</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.809" end="00:25:21.090" style="s2">the Holy Ghost is represented by a dove</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.570" end="00:25:24.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s often associated in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.090" end="00:25:26.340" style="s2">symbolism with the messenger of God</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.119" end="00:25:29.129" style="s2">you know manifesting itself and in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.340" end="00:25:31.049" style="s2">sense one of the deeper deepest</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.129" end="00:25:34.769" style="s2">Christian ideas is the idea that when</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.049" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">Christ died and left there was something</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.769" end="00:25:38.759" style="s2">left behind that was still divine that</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:40.739" style="s2">could communicate with human beings and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.759" end="00:25:42.899" style="s2">that was partly outside and partly</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.739" end="00:25:45.929" style="s2">inside now the thing about Hitler is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.899" end="00:25:48.029" style="s2">that&#39;s not a dove that&#39;s an eagle and an</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.929" end="00:25:50.789" style="s2">eagle is a carrion eater right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.029" end="00:25:53.580" style="s2">bird of prey and so and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.789" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">interesting image because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.580" end="00:25:57.599" style="s2">have to come to terms with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:26:00.539" style="s2">Hitler is a master of speech and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.599" end="00:26:03.119" style="s2">made him a master of logos right because</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.539" end="00:26:06.059" style="s2">that speech and communication but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.119" end="00:26:08.340" style="s2">question is you know that that seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.059" end="00:26:10.529" style="s2">be I think it&#39;s difficult to deny that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.340" end="00:26:13.139" style="s2">that was perverted in the favor of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.529" end="00:26:15.869" style="s2">something else and so the spirit that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.139" end="00:26:18.960" style="s2">coming out of the Sun and flying behind</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.869" end="00:26:21.779" style="s2">Hitler is a devouring carrion eating</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:23.099" style="s2">bird of prey no and that&#39;s and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.779" end="00:26:24.570" style="s2">know people think Eagles they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.099" end="00:26:25.789" style="s2">powerful it is that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.570" end="00:26:28.109" style="s2">national bird of the United States</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.789" end="00:26:29.789" style="s2">Benjamin Franklin recommended that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.109" end="00:26:32.369" style="s2">would be the turkey and everyone laughs</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.789" end="00:26:34.940" style="s2">about that but you know it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.369" end="00:26:34.940" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.809" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2">absolutely absolutely I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.250" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no shortage of things about</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:52.790" style="s2">eagles that inspire admiration in people</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:55.470" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a dove</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.790" end="00:26:57.929" style="s2">so the message and it&#39;s black not white</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.470" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">you know so the message is quite you</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.929" end="00:27:01.890" style="s2">know and the flag itself those are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:04.170" style="s2">three primary colors like if you look</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.890" end="00:27:07.830" style="s2">around cultures worldwide and you look</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.170" end="00:27:10.170" style="s2">at names for colors every culture has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.830" end="00:27:12.900" style="s2">name for black white and red and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.170" end="00:27:15.030" style="s2">after that the colors fragment so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.900" end="00:27:16.559" style="s2">some are more frequently named than</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.030" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">others you know because you can start</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.559" end="00:27:22.110" style="s2">well yeah like it&#39;s orange red well you</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:24.690" style="s2">know yes and no it depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.110" end="00:27:26.220" style="s2">differentiated your your your language</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.690" end="00:27:29.790" style="s2">is but black white and red</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.220" end="00:27:31.170" style="s2">you know that&#39;s fruit day and night</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.790" end="00:27:32.580" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of looking at or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.170" end="00:27:36.390" style="s2">blood day at night</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.580" end="00:27:38.160" style="s2">so or it&#39;s rage day and night or war day</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.390" end="00:27:40.830" style="s2">and night and so it&#39;s a powerful symbol</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.160" end="00:27:42.630" style="s2">it&#39;s also a Sun symbol it&#39;s a Sanskrit</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.830" end="00:27:47.250" style="s2">symbol but it&#39;s rotating backwards</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.630" end="00:27:50.429" style="s2">instead of forwards so you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.250" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">Nazis were very aware in many ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.429" end="00:27:53.820" style="s2">the meanings of the images that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:56.270" style="s2">were using but I&#39;m showing you this</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.820" end="00:27:58.350" style="s2">because I want to show you how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.270" end="00:28:02.850" style="s2">archetypes were captured by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.350" end="00:28:04.800" style="s2">propagandist propagandists or how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.850" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">archetypes were actually manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.800" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">themselves in some sense to produce the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:11.160" style="s2">kind of powerful grip that Hitler had</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:12.840" style="s2">over his audience and it was certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.160" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">the archetypes of order the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.840" end="00:28:22.290" style="s2">of heroism all of those are being put at</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:26.550" style="s2">the service of a political ideology well</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.290" end="00:28:28.770" style="s2">they&#39;re both it depends on the image you</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.550" end="00:28:31.920" style="s2">know so in some images he&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.770" end="00:28:34.920" style="s2">the father of the people in other images</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.920" end="00:28:37.050" style="s2">he&#39;s more like the heroic Marduk at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.920" end="00:28:39.660" style="s2">at the forefront of the march into</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.050" end="00:28:42.870" style="s2">battle with with the illuminated gods</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.660" end="00:28:45.480" style="s2">behind them so and there&#39;s no reason for</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.870" end="00:28:47.160" style="s2">him not to take on both symbolic aspects</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.480" end="00:28:49.870" style="s2">like we know for example that as far as</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.160" end="00:28:52.300" style="s2">the as the Egyptians were concerned</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.870" end="00:28:57.250" style="s2">ideal Pharaoh was half Osiris and half</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.300" end="00:28:58.870" style="s2">Horus right so in embodied stability and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.250" end="00:29:02.410" style="s2">also the vision and the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.870" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">update that stability so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.410" end="00:29:06.970" style="s2">actually counter-propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:08.590" style="s2">or maybe it&#39;s not maybe it&#39;s an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.970" end="00:29:10.270" style="s2">to represent the part of Hitler that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.590" end="00:29:15.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t being represented by the German</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.270" end="00:29:17.920" style="s2">propaganda so on the left you have well</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.400" end="00:29:20.680" style="s2">those are not see snakes they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.920" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">swastikas all over them and so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.680" end="00:29:25.540" style="s2">interesting image as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:27.940" style="s2">concerned because you see how logical it</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.540" end="00:29:30.190" style="s2">is to use the image of the knotted up</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.940" end="00:29:30.670" style="s2">snakes and there&#39;s a frog in there too</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.190" end="00:29:33.270" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.670" end="00:29:36.910" style="s2">snakes and frogs all knotted together</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.270" end="00:29:39.010" style="s2">makes a representation of the enemy the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">evil enemy like you get that at a glance</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.010" end="00:29:42.309" style="s2">right you don&#39;t need that bloody thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.440" style="s2">interpreted it makes perfect sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.309" end="00:29:46.270" style="s2">you know and you see the same things</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.440" end="00:29:48.670" style="s2">interestingly enough I think I showed</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.270" end="00:29:51.040" style="s2">you some of them in representations of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.670" end="00:29:53.350" style="s2">Mary when she&#39;s holding the infant out</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.040" end="00:29:54.790" style="s2">of the way of the snake or the lizard</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.350" end="00:29:57.070" style="s2">that she&#39;s stepping on it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.790" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">similar idea and then you have Hitler&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.070" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">head there as a spreading Hydra</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.970" style="s2">you know he&#39;s sort of like a figure of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:05.950" style="s2">death he&#39;s he&#39;s sort of like Ursula in</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.970" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">the Little Mermaid</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.950" end="00:30:11.620" style="s2">you know except he&#39;s he&#39;s well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.450" style="s2">only a masculine image that because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.620" end="00:30:15.220" style="s2">spreading tentacles that&#39;s snake-like</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.450" end="00:30:17.230" style="s2">again and so there&#39;s an element of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.220" end="00:30:20.559" style="s2">Medusa there so that&#39;s a very archaic</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.230" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">symbol you know and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.559" end="00:30:24.400" style="s2">another image on the right there which</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:27.250" style="s2">is you know a graphical representation</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.400" end="00:30:37.000" style="s2">of Hitler and his head is tangled up</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:39.790" style="s2">with a snake so you can see the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.000" end="00:30:42.730" style="s2">those images have power is because</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.790" end="00:30:45.100" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re taking the power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.730" end="00:30:47.350" style="s2">implicit in the archetype and harnessing</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.100" end="00:30:49.540" style="s2">it for a message that&#39;s intent in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.350" end="00:30:51.400" style="s2">sense actually what propaganda is like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.540" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">if you know the nature of the message</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.400" end="00:30:56.440" style="s2">that you&#39;re using the archetype to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:58.450" style="s2">promote then it&#39;s propaganda if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.440" end="00:31:00.820" style="s2">trying to figure something else out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.450" end="00:31:02.810" style="s2">the symbolic representations come to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.820" end="00:31:05.570" style="s2">mind as part of the creative process</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.810" end="00:31:07.070" style="s2">then that&#39;s not propaganda but then it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.570" end="00:31:08.750" style="s2">also usually means that you end up</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.070" end="00:31:11.240" style="s2">producing a piece of art that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.750" end="00:31:12.680" style="s2">actually don&#39;t understand you know and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.240" end="00:31:14.540" style="s2">there&#39;s still lots of Renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:15.980" style="s2">artists like that like it contains</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.540" end="00:31:18.620" style="s2">information that we haven&#39;t even come</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.980" end="00:31:20.900" style="s2">close to processing yet you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.620" end="00:31:24.200" style="s2">think most artistic representations are</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.900" end="00:31:27.080" style="s2">you know partly propaganda and promptly</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.200" end="00:31:32.630" style="s2">are partly art it depends on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.080" end="00:31:34.850" style="s2">representation so then on the left you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.630" end="00:31:37.610" style="s2">have again that&#39;s that&#39;s anti-nazi</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.850" end="00:31:40.310" style="s2">that&#39;s an anti-nazi poster and you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.610" end="00:31:43.550" style="s2">the idea of the dark figure lurking in</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.310" end="00:31:45.890" style="s2">the background who&#39;s sort of everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.550" end="00:31:47.630" style="s2">gazing at you so that&#39;s like George</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.890" end="00:31:49.730" style="s2">Orwell&#39;s big brother right so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.630" end="00:31:51.530" style="s2">definitely harnessing the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.730" end="00:31:53.840" style="s2">terrible aspect of the Great Father and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.530" end="00:31:55.910" style="s2">I really like this one on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.840" end="00:31:57.410" style="s2">right because that&#39;s basically well</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.910" end="00:31:59.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the Virgin and Child you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.410" end="00:32:00.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not precisely a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.420" end="00:32:02.810" style="s2">image it doesn&#39;t matter because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.680" end="00:32:05.060" style="s2">not precisely a Christian representation</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.810" end="00:32:06.440" style="s2">but she&#39;s beautiful and young and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.060" end="00:32:09.050" style="s2">holding something that&#39;s very vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.440" end="00:32:13.160" style="s2">in her arms and then you see these hands</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.050" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">at the top they&#39;re not see and at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.160" end="00:32:17.090" style="s2">bottom they&#39;re Japanese because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.620" style="s2">symbols are on them and so ones coming</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.090" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">from one end and ones coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.620" end="00:32:25.550" style="s2">other and so what are the hands look</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:30.050" style="s2">like hmm well yeah but why what&#39;s hot</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.550" end="00:32:32.150" style="s2">what makes them evil yeah they have</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.050" end="00:32:34.370" style="s2">claws so they&#39;re predatory right and</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.150" end="00:32:37.130" style="s2">they&#39;re wizened so they&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.370" end="00:32:38.930" style="s2">death and they&#39;re black you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.130" end="00:32:41.210" style="s2">thing is it&#39;s so obvious right you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.930" end="00:32:43.460" style="s2">those are evil hands the question is why</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.210" end="00:32:45.110" style="s2">do you know that they&#39;re evil hands you</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.460" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">know what is it about the image that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.110" end="00:32:49.880" style="s2">announces itself in that way it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:52.430" style="s2">partly because of their juxtaposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.880" end="00:32:56.390" style="s2">with the image of purity so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.430" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">really the absolute corrupt Great Father</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.390" end="00:33:03.170" style="s2">reaching out for the absolute perfect</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.080" end="00:33:06.310" style="s2">feminine and hero the baby hero and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.170" end="00:33:06.310" style="s2">threatening that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.460" end="00:33:15.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s semantic Jewish propaganda on</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.409" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">the right there so first of all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.970" end="00:33:21.369" style="s2">Jewish guy is represented as a money</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:23.830" style="s2">changer and he&#39;s associated with the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.369" end="00:33:26.499" style="s2">Soviet Union because they they Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.830" end="00:33:29.080" style="s2">drew a tight relationship between Jews</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.499" end="00:33:31.629" style="s2">and communism and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.080" end="00:33:33.309" style="s2">amalgamated into the same kind of threat</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.629" end="00:33:35.230" style="s2">and then and certainly the case that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.309" end="00:33:36.460" style="s2">Germany was threatened by communism I</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.230" end="00:33:38.679" style="s2">mean there&#39;s absolutely no doubt about</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.460" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">that but they sort of loved their</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.679" end="00:33:43.570" style="s2">enemies into one category and so what do</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:54.429" style="s2">you think about the representation on</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.570" end="00:33:59.169" style="s2">the right what does it say I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.429" end="00:34:02.679" style="s2">believe so a whole did you say yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.169" end="00:34:05.519" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think so so his eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.679" end="00:34:08.349" style="s2">closed that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.519" end="00:34:10.450" style="s2">his hands is outstretched with money and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.349" end="00:34:13.329" style="s2">he seems to be I would say his hand head</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.450" end="00:34:17.109" style="s2">is oriented towards the money yes is</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.329" end="00:34:18.940" style="s2">that is that right so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.109" end="00:34:23.559" style="s2">he&#39;s leaning on exactly I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.940" end="00:34:25.569" style="s2">what that is but it&#39;s obviously not a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.559" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">flattering representation and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.569" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">have the middle representation yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.110" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good one yeah yeah there</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.850" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">is a goal of element to that do you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">to explain what that means</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.790" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like a zombie</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.700" end="00:35:33.660" style="s2">right so yes so so there&#39;s that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.710" end="00:35:36.570" style="s2">a sort of undead element to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.660" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">representation blind focused only on</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.570" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">money you know and then also aligned</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:51.090" style="s2">with this terrible destructive force of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">communism so another comment yes right</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.090" end="00:35:57.120" style="s2">right yeah good point good point yes so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">then there&#39;s the middle one then you see</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.120" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">the juxtaposition of the Jewish Star of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:04.380" style="s2">David with the Communist hammer and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:06.990" style="s2">sickle and you see the whole world on</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.380" end="00:36:09.090" style="s2">fire and death emerging from that right</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.990" end="00:36:11.430" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s an idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.090" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">ultimate a car apocalypse behind that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.430" end="00:36:15.570" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea of hell behind that</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:18.930" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea of like the Living Dead</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.570" end="00:36:20.820" style="s2">and and then you know and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.930" end="00:36:26.520" style="s2">something that&#39;s sitting on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.820" end="00:36:31.650" style="s2">worlds it&#39;s very satanic image I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.520" end="00:36:32.970" style="s2">it says I don&#39;t know it&#39;s Bolshevik part</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.650" end="00:36:35.850" style="s2">of that is and I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.970" end="00:36:38.520" style="s2">an amalgam there is if isthmus is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.850" end="00:36:40.680" style="s2">reference to Jewishness or not I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.520" end="00:36:46.230" style="s2">it says Bolshevism unmasked it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.680" end="00:36:48.060" style="s2">something like that so you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.230" end="00:36:49.860" style="s2">idea that that the Nazis were</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.060" end="00:36:51.630" style="s2">anti-communist was a very powerful idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.860" end="00:36:54.180" style="s2">for people it made the morality of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.630" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">situation very murky in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:36:58.620" style="s2">because for example when the Nazis went</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">into Russia through the Ukraine the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.620" end="00:37:02.730" style="s2">Ukrainian started to fight with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:04.560" style="s2">Nazis like alongside of them to get rid</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.730" end="00:37:07.080" style="s2">of the Communists because as far as they</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.560" end="00:37:11.130" style="s2">were concerned the Communists were worse</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.080" end="00:37:13.290" style="s2">than the Nazis so you know it was a race</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.130" end="00:37:15.240" style="s2">to the bottom that&#39;s for sure and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.290" end="00:37:16.890" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting because you see the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.240" end="00:37:18.810" style="s2">fire the destructive fire in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.890" end="00:37:20.520" style="s2">and then on the Left well those are</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.810" end="00:37:22.230" style="s2">crematoriums I believe they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.520" end="00:37:24.360" style="s2">Auschwitz and that those are the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.230" end="00:37:28.380" style="s2">remnants of the destroyed bodies in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.360" end="00:37:30.660" style="s2">ovens so you know all of that death and</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:32.370" style="s2">destruction was being projected in some</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.660" end="00:37:36.570" style="s2">sense all the evil was being projected</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.370" end="00:37:39.970" style="s2">onto the Communists and the Jews and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.570" end="00:37:42.849" style="s2">know that allowed the exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.970" end="00:37:50.619" style="s2">to manifest itself in in actuality in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.849" end="00:37:53.050" style="s2">Germany we show that&#39;s the laying out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.619" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">the bodies on the left and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.050" end="00:37:58.150" style="s2">Hitler closer to the end of the war and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:38:02.290" style="s2">you know he&#39;s looking pretty Haggard and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.150" end="00:38:04.690" style="s2">his mouth is down and his countenance</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.290" end="00:38:12.369" style="s2">has fallen which is a phrase that will</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.690" end="00:38:14.470" style="s2">encounter next week so you know you see</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.369" end="00:38:16.690" style="s2">this image of Hitler on the left he sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.470" end="00:38:18.609" style="s2">of friend to children with the mother</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.690" end="00:38:20.349" style="s2">looking on happily in the back and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.609" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">everybody&#39;s smiling and happy and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.349" end="00:38:23.950" style="s2">in the middle you see someone who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:26.530" style="s2">burned one of the things that happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.950" end="00:38:28.180" style="s2">when the Nazis marched the Jews out of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.530" end="00:38:29.710" style="s2">the camps when the Allies were coming is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.180" end="00:38:31.750" style="s2">now and then they put a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.710" end="00:38:33.460" style="s2">in a barn and light it on fire and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.750" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s an image from that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.460" end="00:38:38.650" style="s2">and then that&#39;s a prisoner at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:43.810" style="s2">from one of the who didn&#39;t die from one</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.650" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">of the Holocaust camps so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.810" end="00:38:48.940" style="s2">you know the problem with the image on</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:52.030" style="s2">the left is that it doesn&#39;t factor in</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.940" end="00:38:53.890" style="s2">the image on in the middle and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.030" end="00:38:56.859" style="s2">the thing about propaganda you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.890" end="00:38:58.930" style="s2">like it&#39;s all good it&#39;s like ya know and</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.859" end="00:39:01.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s presenting itself is all good</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.930" end="00:39:03.880" style="s2">then you got to ask yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.240" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">where&#39;s the snake because there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.880" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">a snake and I would say the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:12.099" style="s2">something represents itself as pure good</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.930" style="s2">the bigger the snake so you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.099" end="00:39:16.540" style="s2">Dostoyevsky knew that when he started</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.930" end="00:39:18.070" style="s2">writing anti utopian anti utopian ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.540" end="00:39:19.990" style="s2">especially notes from underground he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.070" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">already figured out that if someone was</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.990" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">promising you heaven that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:25.780" style="s2">probability that there was a hell</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:28.660" style="s2">lurking in there somewhere was well it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.780" end="00:39:30.010" style="s2">was a hundred percent so and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.660" end="00:39:31.990" style="s2">reason that I&#39;ve been working on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.010" end="00:39:33.730" style="s2">ideas in this book and presenting them</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.990" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">to people for so long as I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.730" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">inoculate people against the temptations</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:39.940" style="s2">of utopian thinking and propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:42.790" style="s2">because you should always be asking</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.940" end="00:39:44.589" style="s2">yourself where is the other half if</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.790" end="00:39:46.510" style="s2">nature is all beautiful well what about</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.589" end="00:39:49.089" style="s2">the destructive part you know and if</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.510" end="00:39:52.000" style="s2">you&#39;re offering a utopia well aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.089" end="00:39:53.290" style="s2">also a devil and a tyrant like what are</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.000" end="00:39:54.820" style="s2">you going to do with that part</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.290" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">yeah what what you&#39;re gonna do is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.820" end="00:39:58.930" style="s2">gonna say well I&#39;m not the devil and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.430" style="s2">tyrant it&#39;s those people over there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.930" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">like which only proves that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.430" end="00:40:04.810" style="s2">fact both the devil and the tyrant but</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:06.970" style="s2">it&#39;s much easier for people to put that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.810" end="00:40:08.260" style="s2">out somewhere else you know because do</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.970" end="00:40:09.640" style="s2">you really want to deal with it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.260" end="00:40:11.800" style="s2">you said at the beginning of the class</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.640" end="00:40:13.000" style="s2">he wrote out what horrible things might</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.800" end="00:40:15.370" style="s2">happen to you if you didn&#39;t behave</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.000" end="00:40:17.980" style="s2">properly and that&#39;s unsettling because</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.370" end="00:40:19.330" style="s2">you have to recognize in yourself the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.980" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">capacity to bring something like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.330" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">about it&#39;s even worse than that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.700" style="s2">people can bring that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:26.320" style="s2">about and really enjoy it well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.700" end="00:40:28.810" style="s2">happening you know in a really corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.320" end="00:40:31.240" style="s2">and destructive way it&#39;s a revenge</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.810" end="00:40:33.040" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for revenge and if they</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.240" end="00:40:34.630" style="s2">have to take it on themselves that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.040" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">problem it just makes the revenge even</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.630" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">sweeter</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.750" end="00:40:44.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s juxtapositions again you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.120" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got the crowd that&#39;s surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:47.830" style="s2">Hitler all happy at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.120" end="00:40:49.870" style="s2">there on the left and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.830" end="00:40:51.640" style="s2">that&#39;s cart loads of bodies that were</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.870" end="00:40:55.990" style="s2">taken away from the concentration camps</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.640" end="00:40:58.650" style="s2">when the Allies came in so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.990" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">tyrannical father and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.650" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">positive father you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.490" end="00:41:13.450" style="s2">and that I believe is from Nuremberg</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.560" end="00:41:15.160" style="s2">although I&#39;m not absolutely certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.450" end="00:41:17.320" style="s2">about so Nuremberg was the place where</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.160" end="00:41:19.300" style="s2">the massive Nazi spectacles were held</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.320" end="00:41:22.390" style="s2">you know you can see the Greek and Roman</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.300" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">symbolism there like the classical idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.390" end="00:41:27.160" style="s2">that there was a reestablishment of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:29.349" style="s2">enlightened classical society brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.160" end="00:41:31.680" style="s2">use of light against dark which</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.349" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">something was something that the Nazi as</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:36.790" style="s2">theit&#39;s were unbelievably good at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">use of fire and light and black white</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.790" end="00:42:14.099" style="s2">and red contrast very very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">imagery I would say literature does</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.099" end="00:42:19.660" style="s2">great literature does because it</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:21.580" style="s2">presents people as the battleground</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.660" end="00:42:24.430" style="s2">between chaos and order and good and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.580" end="00:42:27.460" style="s2">evil every person so you know someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.430" end="00:42:30.339" style="s2">might be tilted towards the good in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.460" end="00:42:34.030" style="s2">great piece of literature but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.339" end="00:42:36.070" style="s2">not they&#39;re not comic-book superhero you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.030" end="00:42:38.650" style="s2">know and I mean even the comic books</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.070" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">when they were DC comic books it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.650" end="00:42:43.869" style="s2">pretty damn clear Superman he was all</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:48.670" style="s2">good the evils evil villains they were</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.869" end="00:42:50.080" style="s2">all villainous when the Marvel what</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.670" end="00:42:52.210" style="s2">would you call mythologist sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.080" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">emerged in the 1960s all the characters</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.210" end="00:42:57.790" style="s2">became more nuanced and you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:59.650" style="s2">more palatable to I would say a martyred</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.790" end="00:43:01.420" style="s2">mind but also of course older people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.650" end="00:43:03.609" style="s2">paying attention to the comic-book</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.420" end="00:43:05.740" style="s2">characters now they&#39;re not before they</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.609" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">were for like ten year olds you know so</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.740" end="00:43:09.250" style="s2">they like they couldn&#39;t handle the</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:11.920" style="s2">complexity of something that was more</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.250" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">than one thing at the same time but but</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.920" end="00:43:21.460" style="s2">like if you look at great literature the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">heroes are often 51% good and 49% evil</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.460" end="00:43:26.410" style="s2">you know and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:29.140" style="s2">battle going on inside them and outside</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.410" end="00:43:31.420" style="s2">of them and so that makes it a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.140" end="00:43:33.630" style="s2">nuanced and complex but it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.420" end="00:43:37.510" style="s2">some ways much more frustrating to read</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.630" end="00:43:39.160" style="s2">so yeah so I would say the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.510" end="00:43:42.339" style="s2">literature and the more it approximates</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.160" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t the more balanced the portrayal</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.339" end="00:43:47.200" style="s2">of the entire scenario so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.670" style="s2">chaos in the background you have the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.200" end="00:43:50.890" style="s2">positive and negative feminine in</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.670" end="00:43:53.290" style="s2">various manners you have the tyrant and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.890" end="00:43:55.060" style="s2">the secure father you have the adversary</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.290" end="00:43:57.579" style="s2">in the hero they have the whole picture</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.060" end="00:44:00.820" style="s2">is painted you see the same thing I</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.579" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">think in in any great art so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.820" end="00:44:12.810" style="s2">makes it great yes exactly it tilts into</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:15.180" style="s2">either oversimplification or propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.810" end="00:44:17.500" style="s2">so and it&#39;s dangerous especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.180" end="00:44:19.810" style="s2">especially when it harnesses the</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.500" end="00:44:21.310" style="s2">archetypal forces so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.810" end="00:44:23.829" style="s2">that&#39;s happened since Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.310" end="00:44:26.589" style="s2">announced the death of God is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.829" end="00:44:29.410" style="s2">political entities have appropriated the</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.869" end="00:44:36.160" style="s2">getting rid of them so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.410" style="s2">who&#39;s going to be using them and for</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.160" end="00:44:40.030" style="s2">what you know because we think well</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.410" end="00:44:42.339" style="s2">we&#39;ve transcended all that it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.930" end="00:44:50.710" style="s2">more boneheaded about it then people</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.520" end="00:44:52.829" style="s2">were 200 years ago because now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.710" end="00:44:55.480" style="s2">comic-book superheroes instead of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.829" end="00:44:58.060" style="s2">transcendent deities I don&#39;t see that as</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.060" end="00:45:03.880" style="s2">see it as a regression so and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.170" end="00:45:07.780" style="s2">general who shot himself to death</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.880" end="00:45:11.079" style="s2">a Nazi general you know when the victory</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.780" end="00:45:14.290" style="s2">of the Allies was certain and Hitler by</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.079" end="00:45:17.410" style="s2">that time basically the way Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.290" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">rationalized his defeat was the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.410" end="00:45:22.420" style="s2">let me down Berlin should burn and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:24.730" style="s2">the Russians come in and rape and</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.420" end="00:45:27.609" style="s2">pillage the people who had happens to</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.730" end="00:45:29.650" style="s2">deserve it so that was his final</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.609" end="00:45:30.970" style="s2">judgement on the German people it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.650" end="00:45:33.430" style="s2">that there was something wrong with him</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.970" end="00:45:34.990" style="s2">is that it was that they just failed him</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.430" end="00:45:36.670" style="s2">and so they weren&#39;t up to the glorious</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.990" end="00:45:38.319" style="s2">task that he had set them and</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.670" end="00:45:41.349" style="s2">they deserved all the rack and room that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">was being visited on them so and when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.349" end="00:45:45.040" style="s2">look at that and I see what happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:47.170" style="s2">Hitler shot himself in a bunker far</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.040" end="00:45:49.299" style="s2">below but Berlin when Europe was on fire</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.170" end="00:45:52.510" style="s2">I think what makes you think that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.299" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">what he was after from the beginning no</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.510" end="00:45:55.690" style="s2">one thinks that they think oh well you</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:45:57.849" style="s2">know he wanted to build an empire</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.690" end="00:46:00.030" style="s2">dominate the world and all those things</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.849" end="00:46:03.490" style="s2">it&#39;s like why would you think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.030" end="00:46:06.339" style="s2">there&#39;s an old psychoanalytic idea if</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.490" end="00:46:08.619" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the motivation look</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.339" end="00:46:11.589" style="s2">at the consequences and infer the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.619" end="00:46:13.690" style="s2">motivation it&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.589" end="00:46:17.140" style="s2">intelligent idea so you can&#39;t figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.690" end="00:46:19.750" style="s2">what someone&#39;s up to okay what happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.140" end="00:46:22.030" style="s2">when they do whatever they&#39;re doing well</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.750" end="00:46:23.410" style="s2">if it&#39;s utter catastrophe and pain and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.030" end="00:46:24.819" style="s2">ruin you might think oh well there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.410" end="00:46:26.890" style="s2">some part of him that was aiming at that</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.819" end="00:46:30.069" style="s2">now you know you have to factor out the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.890" end="00:46:31.930" style="s2">effects of random chance but there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.069" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">nothing random about what Hitler did to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.930" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">Europe quite the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:39.220" style="s2">you know and you might ask yourself why</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:41.890" style="s2">did he open up a two-front war you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.220" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t historically ignorant he kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.890" end="00:46:45.309" style="s2">of knew by that point that attacking</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:46.900" style="s2">Russia was probably not the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.309" end="00:46:49.180" style="s2">to do if he actually wanted to win the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.900" end="00:46:52.869" style="s2">war now you know you could say that he</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.180" end="00:46:55.599" style="s2">was arrogant and overvalued the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.869" end="00:46:58.030" style="s2">power of the of the Nazi war machine and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.599" end="00:47:02.410" style="s2">was too contemptuous of the Russians and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.030" end="00:47:06.540" style="s2">part of him no doubt felt that way but</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.410" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">by the same token you can&#39;t suppress the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.540" end="00:47:11.380" style="s2">suspicion that the darkest parts of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:12.250" style="s2">thought that&#39;s the fastest way to Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.380" end="00:47:17.799" style="s2">and rude</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.250" end="00:47:21.640" style="s2">he certainly produced it so I assume</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.799" end="00:47:23.049" style="s2">that the person is aiming for what they</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.640" end="00:47:26.650" style="s2">say they&#39;re aiming for especially if</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.049" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">they use means that are as undeniably</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.650" end="00:47:33.880" style="s2">evil as anything you could possibly come</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:35.829" style="s2">across top left that Stalin and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.880" end="00:47:37.569" style="s2">there&#39;s an old guy kissing a statue of</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.829" end="00:47:39.700" style="s2">Stella and a gold statue still and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.569" end="00:47:42.520" style="s2">that&#39;s after the wall fell you know in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.700" end="00:47:46.390" style="s2">Stellan was an utter monster you know he</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.520" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">made Hitler into he made Hitler up in</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.390" end="00:47:51.050" style="s2">many ways Hitler was a [ __ ] compared to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.310" style="s2">Stalin and one of the very funny</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.050" end="00:47:54.380" style="s2">about Hitler that&#39;s extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.310" end="00:47:56.540" style="s2">funny in the worst possible manner is</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.380" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">that one of the only people he ever</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.540" end="00:47:59.960" style="s2">trusted</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:01.820" style="s2">sorry Stalin one of the people only</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.960" end="00:48:04.700" style="s2">people that Stella never trusted was</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.820" end="00:48:07.310" style="s2">Hitler so he prepared he failed to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.700" end="00:48:10.070" style="s2">prepare the Russian army the Soviet Army</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.310" end="00:48:11.540" style="s2">for a potential invasion by the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.070" end="00:48:13.850" style="s2">because Hitler said he wouldn&#39;t invade</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.540" end="00:48:16.070" style="s2">and so when the Germans finally showed</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.850" end="00:48:18.260" style="s2">up they just blew the Russians back</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.070" end="00:48:19.550" style="s2">they were completely unprepared you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.260" end="00:48:21.170" style="s2">and if the Russians couldn&#39;t have had</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.550" end="00:48:23.180" style="s2">the Germans freeze to death because of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.170" end="00:48:25.730" style="s2">the winter there&#39;s little doubt that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.180" end="00:48:27.530" style="s2">Germans would have overrun the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.730" end="00:48:30.260" style="s2">Union I mean the Russians were tough and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.530" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">they fought like mad but they were</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.260" end="00:48:35.440" style="s2">completely and utterly unprepared so</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.770" end="00:48:45.260" style="s2">okay okay so what we&#39;ve been doing now</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:47.660" style="s2">like we&#39;re I&#39;m kind of working towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.260" end="00:48:49.610" style="s2">the idea we&#39;re moving up the food chain</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.660" end="00:48:51.170" style="s2">in some sense so we talked about chaos</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.610" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">and we talked about the Great Mother and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.170" end="00:48:55.130" style="s2">now we&#39;ve talked about the Great Father</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.750" style="s2">and we&#39;re sort of tilting up towards the</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.130" end="00:48:58.550" style="s2">final level of analysis which is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.750" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">relationship between the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.550" end="00:49:03.020" style="s2">the adversary and then the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:05.780" style="s2">between both of those and the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.020" end="00:49:07.070" style="s2">levels you know and we touched on that a</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.780" end="00:49:09.590" style="s2">little bit today because we could see</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.070" end="00:49:11.870" style="s2">how Hitler was presented both as Great</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.590" end="00:49:14.090" style="s2">Father but also as you know heroic</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.870" end="00:49:15.710" style="s2">leader into the future you see the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.090" end="00:49:18.530" style="s2">thing with Stalin there where he&#39;s shown</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.710" end="00:49:20.660" style="s2">as you know leader of the ship of state</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.530" end="00:49:22.070" style="s2">and he&#39;s far as I&#39;m concerned he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.660" end="00:49:23.810" style="s2">nothing different than Captain Hook</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.070" end="00:49:26.270" style="s2">who&#39;s a tyrant because he&#39;s afraid that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.810" end="00:49:27.830" style="s2">he&#39;s afraid of his own mortality he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.270" end="00:49:29.300" style="s2">afraid of the fact that the crocodile</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.830" end="00:49:31.160" style="s2">has already got a piece of him that</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.300" end="00:49:33.710" style="s2">turns him into a tyrant he&#39;s terrified</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.160" end="00:49:35.000" style="s2">of chaos terrified of the positive</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.710" end="00:49:37.730" style="s2">feminine for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.000" end="00:49:41.180" style="s2">and there you know what you see well</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.730" end="00:49:46.340" style="s2">there&#39;s Stalin you know the father of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.180" end="00:49:48.470" style="s2">all Soviet people loving music friend to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.340" end="00:49:50.300" style="s2">women and children you know and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.470" end="00:49:51.980" style="s2">a statue of Stalin that was toppled</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.300" end="00:49:53.540" style="s2">after the Berlin Wall fell and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.980" end="00:49:56.870" style="s2">covered with red paint well you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.540" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">imagine what that indicates I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.870" end="00:50:02.690" style="s2">like the one on the left</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:04.760" style="s2">that&#39;s Stella I mean I look at that only</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.690" end="00:50:07.220" style="s2">think you could hardly</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.760" end="00:50:08.980" style="s2">if you were attempting to build a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.220" end="00:50:11.330" style="s2">representation of the devil himself</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.980" end="00:50:13.730" style="s2">enveloped in flames you could hardly do</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.330" end="00:50:20.300" style="s2">a better job than that picture you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.730" end="00:50:22.100" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s it&#39;s and then on the law on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.300" end="00:50:23.450" style="s2">left on the right there you have Lenin</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.100" end="00:50:25.310" style="s2">in the background and Stalin in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.450" end="00:50:28.190" style="s2">foreground on the flag you know so those</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.310" end="00:50:32.270" style="s2">are the the two deities of the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.190" end="00:50:33.890" style="s2">state they&#39;re what replaced God once you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.270" end="00:50:35.450" style="s2">know once Nietzsche had announced God</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.890" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">was dead it was like okay well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.450" end="00:50:39.860" style="s2">gonna come up and fill that void it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:44.600" style="s2">like oh good it&#39;s Hitler and Lenin and</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.860" end="00:50:48.590" style="s2">Stalin that&#39;s a real improvement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.600" end="00:50:50.420" style="s2">Mao on the left there and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.590" end="00:50:51.830" style="s2">estimates are that he was involved in</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.420" end="00:50:54.470" style="s2">the death of about a hundred million</p>
