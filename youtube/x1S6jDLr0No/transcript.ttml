<p begin="00:00:06.529" end="00:00:12.559" style="s2">so we&#39;ve talked about this before but</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.200" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">stoicism is kind of undergoing</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.559" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">resurgence and I know you&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:19.650" style="s2">quite a bit about stoicism in the past</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">right can you tell me about bit more</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.650" end="00:00:22.470" style="s2">about that I know you&#39;ve kind of linked</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">it to Silicon Valley and you&#39;ve linked</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.470" end="00:00:26.880" style="s2">it yeah and kind of almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:29.039" style="s2">Western form of Buddhism right yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.880" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">stoicism kind of ancient Greek</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">philosophy it&#39;s very practical it was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:37.680" style="s2">kind of form of therapy for the emotions</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">it has enjoyed an unlikely revival I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">would say in the last 10 years the name</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">comes from the stoic point lay which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:45.480" style="s2">called the painted colonnade which is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:47.190" style="s2">kind of particular street in Athens they</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.480" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">would gather at each in the street so</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.190" end="00:00:53.969" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of open streets philosophy the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">idea of it is that we should live</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.969" end="00:00:59.010" style="s2">according to nature and their definition</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">of nature&#39;s that were rational moral</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.010" end="00:01:04.979" style="s2">beings so we should learn to develop our</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">reason and and our virtue and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">thought that would be enough to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">so they promised happiness all you need</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.340" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">to be happy is just to develop your</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">virtue that idea comes from Socrates and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">basically you develop your virtue by not</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:22.320" style="s2">being attached to externals or averse to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2">them so it&#39;s quite similar to Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.320" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">and Daoism and so on in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">Seneca a stoic philosopher says the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">stoic sees everything is training the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">obstacle is the way so you lose your job</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:37.799" style="s2">it&#39;s conventionally awful but for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">stoic it&#39;s actually potentially a moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.799" end="00:01:44.270" style="s2">of profound awakening and and liberation</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">from from from conventional goods</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.270" end="00:01:49.079" style="s2">similar to other spiritual traditions</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">really you get a terrible illness</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.079" end="00:01:54.869" style="s2">conventionally is awful but it could be</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">morally and spiritually awakening and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.869" end="00:02:00.750" style="s2">this theory was the main inspiration for</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:02.300" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy so it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.750" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">of things I looked at my book</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.300" end="00:02:07.410" style="s2">Albert Ellis the man who invented really</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">pioneered cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.410" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">and Aaron Beck the other guy who</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:14.730" style="s2">invented both were inspired by stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:18.150" style="s2">and the stoic therapy of the emotions so</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.730" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">what the stoic says whenever you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.150" end="00:02:25.470" style="s2">powerful emotional reaction to something</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">it may feel involuntary and automatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.470" end="00:02:32.930" style="s2">and beyond your control but actually all</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:35.160" style="s2">emotions involve judgments and beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.930" end="00:02:38.340" style="s2">you know like the judgment that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.160" end="00:02:41.340" style="s2">terrifying and I&#39;m going to die and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">that&#39;s awful or the judgments you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.340" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">that&#39;s she&#39;s perfect and desirable and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">you know I must I must go out with her</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">or something like that and you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">actually look at the belief or judgment</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:02:59.100" style="s2">underlying an emotion and say is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:02.630" style="s2">definitely true is that definitely wise</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.100" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">do I definitely have to believe that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.630" end="00:03:08.340" style="s2">so we have some control we don&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">have control over what happens to us but</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.340" end="00:03:13.709" style="s2">we have some control over our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">our opinions our interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.709" end="00:03:19.890" style="s2">things we can choose our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">Marcus Aurelius the stoic Empress said</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.890" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">life is but what you deem it life itself</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">is but what you deem it so we can choose</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:27.780" style="s2">our perspective on the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">happen to us and that will affect how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.780" end="00:03:38.900" style="s2">feel so for example when I was younger I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:42.930" style="s2">had bad social anxiety crippling and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.900" end="00:03:44.310" style="s2">that was it felt like I messed myself up</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.930" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">on drugs and that this was something</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.310" end="00:03:48.390" style="s2">neurochemical beyond my control and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">thought God is it going to be like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.390" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">for the rest of my life have I ruined my</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">life and maybe there&#39;s nothing I can do</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:56.850" style="s2">about it apart from take beta blockers</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.459" end="00:04:00.090" style="s2">or you know other drugs and then through</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.850" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">stoicism I realized actually this awful</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.090" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">anxiety and terror I feel is connected</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">to my beliefs and my values and my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:10.410" style="s2">philosophy which was unconscious my</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:12.690" style="s2">unconscious life philosophy which I got</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.410" end="00:04:14.129" style="s2">grown up with and got for my family in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.690" end="00:04:17.910" style="s2">my school and Mike</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.129" end="00:04:20.400" style="s2">was basically I must be approved of by</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.910" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">all people and if I don&#39;t it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.400" end="00:04:24.750" style="s2">disaster the mote you know that my value</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">is very much tight what other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.750" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">think of me and I grew up with terrible</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:31.260" style="s2">showoff</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">and I loved making other people laugh</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.260" end="00:04:36.690" style="s2">and impressing people and amassing</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:38.910" style="s2">honors and glory so I had a an identity</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.690" end="00:04:41.310" style="s2">extremely geared towards external</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.910" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">approval and the flip side of that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.310" end="00:04:47.039" style="s2">was was with social anxiety and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:49.530" style="s2">of and I thought God that I&#39;m doing this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.039" end="00:04:52.470" style="s2">to myself through my own beliefs my own</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.530" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">unconscious automatic beliefs and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.470" end="00:04:56.430" style="s2">know I could use the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">Stoicism to become aware of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.430" end="00:05:01.710" style="s2">automatic unconscious beliefs this this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:04.530" style="s2">unconscious life philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.710" end="00:05:07.949" style="s2">completely shaping my reality and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.530" end="00:05:09.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a dumb way to think you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.949" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible you&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.720" end="00:05:16.199" style="s2">get everyone to like you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">it&#39;s an unwise philosophy so you can use</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.199" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">that you know you use the practice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:21.810" style="s2">CBT in stores and they call it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:23.940" style="s2">Socratic method why am I getting so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.810" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">worked up about this what belief is</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.940" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">underlying this emotion is that belief</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">definitely true</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.599" end="00:05:34.470" style="s2">why am i putting so much emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">something that&#39;s beyond my control other</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.470" end="00:05:39.060" style="s2">people&#39;s opinions and that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:40.710" style="s2">fickle that just you know the stock</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.060" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">market of pulpit public opinions</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.710" end="00:05:44.310" style="s2">constantly going up or down so if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">make that the basis of your self-esteem</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.310" end="00:05:49.139" style="s2">you are never going to be stable or</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:52.380" style="s2">happy why not bring it back to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.139" end="00:05:54.150" style="s2">within my control my own beliefs my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.380" end="00:05:58.680" style="s2">opinions why not choose to accept myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.150" end="00:06:02.070" style="s2">even if other people don&#39;t and what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.680" end="00:06:04.560" style="s2">found was that once I started to follow</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.070" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">this this kind of different philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.560" end="00:06:07.830" style="s2">it affected my emotions as well I</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:14.940" style="s2">stopped having a panic attacks I stopped</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.830" end="00:06:16.660" style="s2">feeling so anxious so yeah so stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.940" end="00:06:18.610" style="s2">was extremely helpful to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.660" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">terms of kind of coming through that</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.610" end="00:06:24.820" style="s2">anxiety and transforming my thoughts and</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.850" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">common now to have articles about</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.790" style="s2">even have to say stoicism which by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.230" end="00:06:48.430" style="s2">way is an ancient philosophy from Rome</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.790" end="00:06:53.740" style="s2">people it&#39;s it&#39;s you hear it mentioned</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.820" end="00:07:13.720" style="s2">why now people feel out of control</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.090" end="00:07:15.820" style="s2">stoicism says except that except you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.720" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">can&#39;t control the external world but you</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.820" end="00:07:20.860" style="s2">can find a measure of serenity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:22.630" style="s2">happiness and moral meaning by focusing</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.860" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">on what is in your control your own</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">a time of great political turbulence</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.430" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">when the Greek city-states were being</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:35.770" style="s2">conquered by marauding empires before</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.580" style="s2">then Greek philosophers had always tied</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.770" end="00:07:40.990" style="s2">the good life to the good Society</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.580" end="00:07:44.190" style="s2">stoicism says you can have a good life</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.990" end="00:07:48.990" style="s2">even in a bad society even admidst chaos</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.190" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">so quite good for our times as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.990" end="00:07:54.540" style="s2">secondly because of the the familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:56.470" style="s2">and popularity with cognitive therapy</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.540" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">millions and millions of people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.470" end="00:08:00.640" style="s2">been helped by cognitive therapy or know</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.590" style="s2">what it is whenever I do a talk on</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.640" end="00:08:04.930" style="s2">stoicism I always say who has heard of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.590" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">CBT it&#39;s always like probably over 50%</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.930" end="00:08:12.910" style="s2">of people have now more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:15.310" style="s2">are aware that&#39;s how much CBT owes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.910" end="00:08:18.940" style="s2">stoicism both in its theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.310" end="00:08:22.089" style="s2">emotions and in specific practices like</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.940" end="00:08:25.639" style="s2">using a journal like using Max</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.089" end="00:08:28.359" style="s2">like the Socratic method and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.639" end="00:08:30.949" style="s2">stoicism seems to be a kind of rational</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.359" end="00:08:33.769" style="s2">evidence-based theory that fits with</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.949" end="00:08:35.689" style="s2">science it&#39;s a moral philosophy but it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.769" end="00:08:37.219" style="s2">kind of fits with science as well where</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.689" end="00:08:40.490" style="s2">you live in a very skeptical time so</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.219" end="00:08:43.129" style="s2">people like that you can use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.490" end="00:08:45.620" style="s2">techniques of stoicism whether you</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.129" end="00:08:48.889" style="s2">believe in God or not so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:51.139" style="s2">popular with atheists and skeptics or</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.889" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">with people who like Miam or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.139" end="00:08:58.249" style="s2">more like theistic plus it&#39;s it&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:00.559" style="s2">Western culture so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.249" end="00:09:02.509" style="s2">you know it kind of gives you a way into</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.559" end="00:09:05.540" style="s2">this wonderful tradition going back to</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.509" end="00:09:08.199" style="s2">Socrates going through Shakespeare whose</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.540" end="00:09:10.040" style="s2">variant esterases and going through</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.199" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">Montaigne going through the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.040" end="00:09:15.709" style="s2">Enlightenment philosophers you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:18.019" style="s2">part of a way we we&#39;ve had to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.709" end="00:09:20.079" style="s2">things like Tibetan Buddhism or Peruvian</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.019" end="00:09:23.689" style="s2">shamanism which are awesome traditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.079" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">but we can also find these things in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.689" end="00:09:28.279" style="s2">own culture and have a connection to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:30.829" style="s2">2,000 years of Western culture so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.279" end="00:09:32.689" style="s2">amazing as well you mentioned before</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.829" end="00:09:35.420" style="s2">that it&#39;s sort of Silicon Valley is</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.689" end="00:09:37.100" style="s2">somewhere that seems quite aligned with</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.420" end="00:09:38.689" style="s2">it I&#39;m thinking I don&#39;t know if Tim</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.100" end="00:09:40.459" style="s2">Ferriss has ever talked specifically</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.689" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">about stoicism did its head to a clinic</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.459" end="00:09:45.620" style="s2">yeah when I think of Tim Ferriss I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a real stoic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.620" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">quality to a modern what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:52.600" style="s2">about I didn&#39;t know he&#39;d actually done a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:57.639" style="s2">specific talk about it yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.600" end="00:09:59.689" style="s2">stoicism in a way is quite a neat tidy</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.639" end="00:10:02.540" style="s2">philosophy for if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.689" end="00:10:05.059" style="s2">engineering mind and you want algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.540" end="00:10:07.009" style="s2">for life let Darren brown say the thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.059" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">he loves about stem is a clear thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.009" end="00:10:14.449" style="s2">this in my control or not you know if no</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">accept it if you get quite you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.449" end="00:10:19.490" style="s2">anxious about uncertainty or ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.230" style="s2">this is a clear algorithm so engineers</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.490" end="00:10:24.019" style="s2">love it for that reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.230" end="00:10:26.779" style="s2">entrepreneurs love it because they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.019" end="00:10:29.149" style="s2">to deal with so much uncertainty they</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.779" end="00:10:32.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know we know this has been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.149" end="00:10:37.820" style="s2">entrepreneurial ourselves you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.990" end="00:10:41.089" style="s2">you status volatility you don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.820" end="00:10:43.670" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re if your brilliant idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.089" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">is going to take off and you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.670" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">be you know a massive hit or if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:53.660" style="s2">going to kind of slump and you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:55.010" style="s2">have experiences tastes of both so so</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.660" end="00:10:57.200" style="s2">entrepreneurs have to deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.010" end="00:10:59.450" style="s2">like from going to feeling like a god to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.200" end="00:11:02.690" style="s2">a kind of nobody</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.450" end="00:11:05.570" style="s2">and so stoicism gives them a way to help</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.690" end="00:11:08.600" style="s2">them find a sense of security inner</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.570" end="00:11:11.690" style="s2">security and inner meaning that is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.600" end="00:11:16.940" style="s2">dependent on that stock market of public</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.690" end="00:11:20.390" style="s2">opinion and it helps them deal with risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.940" end="00:11:21.770" style="s2">and the fear of failure and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.390" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">that&#39;s why Tim Ferriss is particularly</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.770" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">into it his his TED talks on using</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:27.230" style="s2">stoicism to cope with the fear of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:31.450" style="s2">failure and plus of course Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.230" end="00:11:33.770" style="s2">ancient Stoics were not ascetics</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.450" end="00:11:36.050" style="s2">they were people of the world like</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.770" end="00:11:40.100" style="s2">Seneca was both the stoic and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.050" end="00:11:41.510" style="s2">richest men in the Roman Empire Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.100" end="00:11:44.029" style="s2">Aurelius probably had a few Bob as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.510" end="00:11:48.380" style="s2">yeah yeah he was that he was the emperor</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.029" end="00:11:50.540" style="s2">of Rome so yeah if you&#39;re out in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.380" end="00:11:53.660" style="s2">world as well this is in a way a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.540" end="00:11:55.910" style="s2">philosophy in a detachment but not of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.660" end="00:11:57.709" style="s2">going off to a cave or becoming a monk</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.910" end="00:12:00.529" style="s2">so in some ways it kind of fits with</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.709" end="00:12:04.610" style="s2">Western society more obviously than</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.529" end="00:12:07.670" style="s2">Buddhism which was a mania philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.610" end="00:12:10.520" style="s2">for ascetics for monks seems very</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.670" end="00:12:12.020" style="s2">Christian influenced but stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.520" end="00:12:14.089" style="s2">predates Christianity yeah I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.020" end="00:12:15.589" style="s2">Christianity is stoic influenced so</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.089" end="00:12:17.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the common ancestor if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.589" end="00:12:19.820" style="s2">common ancestor Christianity is directly</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.720" end="00:12:24.410" style="s2">influenced by stoicism and by Greek</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.820" end="00:12:30.220" style="s2">philosophy stoic Greek Christianity is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.410" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">mash up of Judaism and Greek philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.220" end="00:12:38.120" style="s2">so the Gospel of John says Jesus is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:39.380" style="s2">logos made flesh which is a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.120" end="00:12:41.540" style="s2">in a way you know because Greek</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.380" end="00:12:43.500" style="s2">philosophy has this idea of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.540" end="00:12:48.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s a rather intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.500" end="00:12:50.850" style="s2">abstract principle and Christianity says</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.120" end="00:12:55.590" style="s2">okay you know that that&#39;s a person who</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.850" end="00:12:57.990" style="s2">died for you and you know as Hinduism</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.590" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">found Hinduism did something similar</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.990" end="00:13:02.520" style="s2">with the Bhagavad Gita before that had</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:04.440" style="s2">this idea of the Brahman this</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.520" end="00:13:06.510" style="s2">intellectual principle it&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.440" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">difficult to really love that inflation</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.510" end="00:13:10.470" style="s2">principle so they said yes and and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:12.570" style="s2">know that&#39;s actually Krishna this this</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.470" end="00:13:14.180" style="s2">this wonderful being so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.570" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">bhagavad-gita was taking that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.180" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">abstract intellectual monotheism of via</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:19.740" style="s2">Panna shirts and turning into a much</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:24.480" style="s2">more of a devotional thing centered on</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:26.100" style="s2">him on a person but yeah the early you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.480" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">know Christianity is deeply influenced</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.100" end="00:13:33.810" style="s2">by Greek philosophy and by stoicism the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:38.900" style="s2">early Christian fathers were really</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.810" end="00:13:38.900" style="s2">literate on Greek philosophy Augustine</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.530" end="00:13:43.560" style="s2">was a neoplatonist before he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.910" end="00:13:47.070" style="s2">Christian and he took loads of his</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.560" end="00:13:49.080" style="s2">Neoplatonism with him later christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.070" end="00:13:51.420" style="s2">medusa mystics like st. Teresa of Avila</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.080" end="00:13:54.330" style="s2">her nickname for some John of the Cross</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.420" end="00:14:00.120" style="s2">who who kind of lived with him was my</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.330" end="00:14:02.610" style="s2">little Seneca yes so Nietzsche said that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.120" end="00:14:06.930" style="s2">Christianity is just Platonism for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.610" end="00:14:09.720" style="s2">masses but there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.930" end="00:14:14.520" style="s2">kinds of similarities and in fact when I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.720" end="00:14:16.680" style="s2">was a Christian briefly and I thought</p>
