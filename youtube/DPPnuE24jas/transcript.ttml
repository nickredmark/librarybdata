<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.310" style="s2">all right so the idea is to want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.750" end="00:00:07.049" style="s2">share where I think are two pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.310" end="00:00:08.790" style="s2">fundamental things that will I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:12.090" style="s2">help make sense about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:15.900" style="s2">right now the first has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.090" end="00:00:20.400" style="s2">the nature of I guess psychology or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.900" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">way that we go about solving problems</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.400" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">and the second has to do with the way</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">that our society or our political</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.789" end="00:00:32.340" style="s2">framework polarizes in events like</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">what&#39;s going on right now so the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.340" end="00:00:41.030" style="s2">basic idea is this there is and has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">a whole framework for how we go about</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.030" end="00:00:48.200" style="s2">being effective in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">this is habits and ideas techniques</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.200" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">tools a whole set of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:56.010" style="s2">assumptions about the epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">things like how we know what is true and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.010" end="00:01:02.760" style="s2">what is not true frankly the greater</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">part most of the frameworks of Western</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.760" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">science developed since Newton and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">Leibniz first laid down some of the key</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">ideas that is awesome for doing things</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">like building rocket ships and taking</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:17.729" style="s2">them to moon and bring them back or</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">putting on a Boeing 777 they can fly</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.729" end="00:01:26.220" style="s2">across the world but is really really</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">really inappropriate for the sets of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">things that we&#39;re trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">right now and I mean that in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">fundamental way meaning that the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">underlying epistemological assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">about the nature of what knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">and how one goes about even asking</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:53.729" style="s2">questions is contradictory that is it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:57.320" style="s2">just the wrong tool now this this fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.729" end="00:01:59.189" style="s2">raises enormous cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.320" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">particularly it raises cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.189" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">dissonance if you&#39;re really good at</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">using the old tool either because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.910" style="s2">you have high efficacy in it or because</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:10.789" style="s2">it&#39;s led you to a position of success so</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.910" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">this goes to the second point</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.789" end="00:02:17.019" style="s2">the first main theme which is that human</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:21.129" style="s2">psychology and quite likely actually a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.019" end="00:02:23.930" style="s2">higher level abstraction nature of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.129" end="00:02:28.129" style="s2">complex systems in general is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.930" end="00:02:30.980" style="s2">they&#39;re intrinsically conservative if</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.129" end="00:02:33.500" style="s2">something has worked meaningfully for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.980" end="00:02:38.510" style="s2">significant period of time it is just</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.500" end="00:02:38.930" style="s2">the case that changing is usually a bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.510" end="00:02:40.549" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.930" end="00:02:42.139" style="s2">it&#39;s risky to try to change into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.549" end="00:02:43.099" style="s2">work consistently for a long period</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.139" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">trying to think that it&#39;s like a basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.099" end="00:02:46.939" style="s2">conservative principle and this is true</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:50.209" style="s2">often enough in evolutionary history</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.939" end="00:02:55.579" style="s2">that it is a pretty hard hardwired into</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.209" end="00:02:56.780" style="s2">our into our genes and this is true by</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.579" end="00:02:59.629" style="s2">the way also an individual psychological</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.780" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">level right so if you have developed as</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.629" end="00:03:03.230" style="s2">a person and you build a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">approaches and strategies that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.230" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">worked for a long period of time or at</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:12.430" style="s2">least seem to work for a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">time your your baseline set of signals</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.430" end="00:03:17.449" style="s2">will tell you not to stop doing that not</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">to change it if you change it change it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.449" end="00:03:22.909" style="s2">at the edges but keep the core intact</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:24.229" style="s2">and this basic fundamental shows up all</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.909" end="00:03:28.099" style="s2">over the place it shows up in things</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.229" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">like how hard is to make big changes in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.099" end="00:03:30.470" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:31.819" style="s2">it shows the things like why it is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.470" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">we have a tendency to become addictive</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.819" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">because addiction is when that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:37.849" style="s2">conservative principle loses track of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:39.919" style="s2">what seems to be good for us and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.849" end="00:03:41.690" style="s2">actually is good for us and the seeming</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.919" end="00:03:43.099" style="s2">is so powerful that will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.690" end="00:03:46.099" style="s2">reinforce and actually mount that to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.099" end="00:03:49.729" style="s2">behavior until we no longer can even</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.099" end="00:03:50.750" style="s2">right so so hold there for a second and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.729" end="00:03:53.150" style="s2">now I&#39;m going to move to the second part</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.750" end="00:03:56.840" style="s2">and then fill in the blank so the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.150" end="00:03:59.419" style="s2">big piece is that it appears to be the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.840" end="00:04:03.109" style="s2">case that there is a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.419" end="00:04:08.259" style="s2">correlation between a basic personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:11.299" style="s2">type and political leanings so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.259" end="00:04:12.409" style="s2">specifically there are two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.299" end="00:04:13.939" style="s2">personality types that have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.409" end="00:04:15.829" style="s2">identified by coding detailed to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.939" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">framework and Franklin item particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.829" end="00:04:20.180" style="s2">attached to it this is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:22.370" style="s2">the language one is called the train is</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.180" end="00:04:25.880" style="s2">called openness and the other trade is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.370" end="00:04:27.890" style="s2">called orderliness so openness is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.880" end="00:04:29.420" style="s2">something like the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.890" end="00:04:31.610" style="s2">like to experiment in which you find</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.420" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">novelty itself to be viable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.610" end="00:04:37.760" style="s2">interesting and so people who are high</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">in trait openness tend also to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.760" end="00:04:42.380" style="s2">politically liberal and this is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:46.010" style="s2">high correlation between the two and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.380" end="00:04:48.710" style="s2">then by contrast orderliness is as do</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.010" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">the things like having pieces in their</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.710" end="00:04:52.310" style="s2">place if you&#39;re the kind of person when</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:54.920" style="s2">you have your your dinner you like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.310" end="00:04:56.630" style="s2">have all the ingredients be separate in</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.920" end="00:05:00.260" style="s2">their own place on the plate that is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.630" end="00:05:02.540" style="s2">very orderly trait and people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.260" end="00:05:04.160" style="s2">high in trade orderliness and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.540" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">particular they&#39;re also low in trade</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.160" end="00:05:08.270" style="s2">openness mean they don&#39;t really have any</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">intrinsic attraction of novelty they</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.270" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">tend to stick you in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:13.430" style="s2">being conservative and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:14.780" style="s2">essentially quite important as just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">getting to know each other level because</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.780" end="00:05:18.770" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about fundamental things</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">that give rise to personality upon which</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.770" end="00:05:23.390" style="s2">political opinions are sort of epic</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">phenomenon so when you&#39;re engaging with</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.390" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2">somebody who has is on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:28.070" style="s2">that you&#39;re actually dealing consider a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">lot more foundational than just their</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.070" end="00:05:31.460" style="s2">and their political opinions it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:34.070" style="s2">how they go about making sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.460" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">is good in the world which is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.070" end="00:05:36.680" style="s2">tied to stuff like how they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.300" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">wired or at least core early</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.680" end="00:05:43.250" style="s2">developmental stages now the key idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:46.220" style="s2">here is that these two deep approaches</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.250" end="00:05:50.360" style="s2">actually respond to fear differently</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.220" end="00:05:52.460" style="s2">when things seem not to be working when</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">our social assumptions or social</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.460" end="00:05:56.750" style="s2">frameworks or social ideas or social</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">institutions aren&#39;t working the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.750" end="00:06:02.920" style="s2">conservative impulse is to retreat into</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:05.630" style="s2">orderliness which if it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.920" end="00:06:07.880" style="s2">frustrated will become reactionary which</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.630" end="00:06:09.260" style="s2">is in fact to retreat into a hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.880" end="00:06:12.860" style="s2">level of orderliness which is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.260" end="00:06:15.290" style="s2">imaginary orderliness that is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.860" end="00:06:18.520" style="s2">an Elysium of Organists that they kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.290" end="00:06:18.520" style="s2">of recall at an emotional level</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.790" end="00:06:27.229" style="s2">by contrast the liberals will retreat</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.330" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">into openness which the hypertrophic</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.229" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2">ation of that is in fact actually in</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:34.710" style="s2">right insanity is the such a complete</p>

<p begin="00:06:34.710" end="00:06:39.689" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a random search and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.129" end="00:06:43.439" style="s2">this is part of what&#39;s going on is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.689" end="00:06:45.539" style="s2">the people who are high in in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.439" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">orderliness are pulling hard in this</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.490" end="00:07:00.449" style="s2">of the what happens to the mental state</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.620" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">when it just begins to explore new</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.449" end="00:07:04.379" style="s2">territory radically and this is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:07.530" style="s2">evolutionary because the question being</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.379" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">asked of the tribe is do we stay at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.530" end="00:07:12.539" style="s2">old watering hole in spite of many years</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:14.129" style="s2">of drought or do we leave and try to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.539" end="00:07:15.629" style="s2">find a new watering hole in spite of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.129" end="00:07:17.849" style="s2">fact that we&#39;ll probably die on route</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.629" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a question we have faced many</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.849" end="00:07:21.990" style="s2">many times in evolutionary time and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:24.029" style="s2">is the polarity of how it pulls apart</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.990" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">and as pulling the fabric of society</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.029" end="00:07:28.229" style="s2">apart now here&#39;s the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:31.319" style="s2">that I want to bring to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.229" end="00:07:33.449" style="s2">center there&#39;s a third Pole in this in</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.319" end="00:07:35.969" style="s2">this continuum and these are the elites</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.449" end="00:07:37.289" style="s2">the actual people who currently control</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.969" end="00:07:39.389" style="s2">choice-making</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.289" end="00:07:41.969" style="s2">now what&#39;s interesting about the elites</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.389" end="00:07:43.050" style="s2">is they are intrinsically conservative</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.969" end="00:07:44.699" style="s2">from the beginning part of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.050" end="00:07:47.190" style="s2">conversation if you have been successful</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.699" end="00:07:48.900" style="s2">for a long period of time using a set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.190" end="00:07:51.210" style="s2">strategies and practices and techniques</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.900" end="00:07:52.259" style="s2">in your own psychology how you adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.210" end="00:07:54.870" style="s2">the world or the way that the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.259" end="00:07:56.849" style="s2">institutions have adapted to you then</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.870" end="00:07:59.729" style="s2">you are going to be intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.849" end="00:08:02.370" style="s2">conservative change is a bad choice for</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.729" end="00:08:05.940" style="s2">you now what&#39;s happening to that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.370" end="00:08:07.800" style="s2">they&#39;re holding here and the signal the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.940" end="00:08:09.690" style="s2">change of some sort must happen either</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.800" end="00:08:11.969" style="s2">at pull in this way or a pull in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.690" end="00:08:16.020" style="s2">way is going to land on them</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.969" end="00:08:17.639" style="s2">last or that will be pushing hardest</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.020" end="00:08:20.190" style="s2">against them before they break because</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.639" end="00:08:24.839" style="s2">they have the most to lose if you happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.190" end="00:08:26.940" style="s2">to be say Sergey Brin and you&#39;re the one</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.839" end="00:08:29.310" style="s2">of the biggest winners there is of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.940" end="00:08:31.979" style="s2">game a that is the process of falling</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.310" end="00:08:33.810" style="s2">apart it&#39;s a really really hard choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.979" end="00:08:35.969" style="s2">for you to make to leave the watering</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.810" end="00:08:37.409" style="s2">opportunity to change in such a way they</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.969" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">may be giving up a lot of stuff it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.409" end="00:08:41.889" style="s2">long way to fall it&#39;s a hard fall for</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.810" end="00:08:43.959" style="s2">most of us to go through</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.889" end="00:08:46.239" style="s2">reboot to a full snow crash and</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.959" end="00:08:47.739" style="s2">completely give up a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.239" end="00:08:49.449" style="s2">that we&#39;ve used to survive and thrive in</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.739" end="00:08:51.249" style="s2">the world you know our money our</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.449" end="00:08:52.989" style="s2">relationships that people who can count</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.249" end="00:08:55.269" style="s2">on us that&#39;s the thought process that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.989" end="00:08:57.459" style="s2">use to solve problems but if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.269" end="00:08:59.499" style="s2">question being asked if the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.459" end="00:09:01.779" style="s2">being posed is exactly that then the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.499" end="00:09:03.249" style="s2">pressure will continue to build and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.779" end="00:09:04.899" style="s2">is going to start throwing all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.249" end="00:09:07.299" style="s2">errors the people who are currently in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.899" end="00:09:09.609" style="s2">the position they are entrusted with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.299" end="00:09:11.790" style="s2">choice making with a necessity of making</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.609" end="00:09:14.279" style="s2">good deep powerful choices are</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.790" end="00:09:16.299" style="s2">simultaneously going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.279" end="00:09:18.970" style="s2">hyperbolically separated from their</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.299" end="00:09:20.829" style="s2">capacity to make choices because what</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.970" end="00:09:23.079" style="s2">got them to right the right to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.829" end="00:09:25.809" style="s2">choices was that they were really really</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.079" end="00:09:27.970" style="s2">good at playing game a but the choices</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.809" end="00:09:29.769" style="s2">they&#39;re being made to ask our choices</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.970" end="00:09:32.290" style="s2">that are in a new game which we can call</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.769" end="00:09:34.869" style="s2">me in B and they don&#39;t have a framework</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.290" end="00:09:37.239" style="s2">for getting to game B and traversing</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.869" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">from gaming to game B requires a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.239" end="00:09:41.499" style="s2">which it makes no sense for them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:44.230" style="s2">actually cross and that&#39;s a very painful</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.499" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">and very challenging position to be in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.230" end="00:09:47.049" style="s2">and so you can imagine that what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:48.899" style="s2">on right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.049" end="00:09:51.489" style="s2">and what will continue to go on until</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.899" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">something resolved the crisis is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.489" end="00:09:54.489" style="s2">there is a separation it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:57.579" style="s2">rending in a ripping in that Britain</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.489" end="00:09:59.439" style="s2">will continue to come up as it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.579" end="00:10:01.449" style="s2">impossible for people not to get pulled</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.439" end="00:10:04.029" style="s2">into it until eventually the some</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.449" end="00:10:05.499" style="s2">fraction of the folks at the top pop and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.029" end="00:10:06.879" style="s2">they go through their own crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.499" end="00:10:08.169" style="s2">whatever they need to go through and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.879" end="00:10:12.419" style="s2">they can then transition to be on the</p>
